[735. Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using a stack. 

# Approach
1. Iterate through each asteroid in the array.
2. For each asteroid, do the following:
   - If the stack is empty or the current asteroid is moving to the right (positive) or the top of the stack is also moving to the right, push the current asteroid onto the stack.
   - If the current asteroid is moving to the left (negative) and the top of the stack is moving to the right (positive), keep exploding asteroids until either the current asteroid explodes or there are no more asteroids to explode.
3. Finally, return the contents of the stack.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this approach is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the input array `asteroids`.

# Code`
```typescript
function asteroidCollision(asteroids: number[]): number[] {
    const stack: number[] = [];
    
    for (const asteroid of asteroids) {
        if (asteroid > 0 || stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] < 0) {
            stack.push(asteroid);
        } else {
            while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] < -asteroid) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack[stack.length - 1] < 0) {
                stack.push(asteroid);
            } else if (stack[stack.length - 1] === -asteroid) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
    }
    
    return stack;
};

```
