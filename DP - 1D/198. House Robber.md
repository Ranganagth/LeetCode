[198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the `i`th house without alerting the police. 

The robber has two choices at each house: rob the current house and add its value to the loot, or skip the current house and carry over the loot from the previous house.

# Approach

1. Initialize two variables `prev` and `curr` to represent the maximum loot up to the previous and current houses, respectively.
2. Iterate through the houses, updating `curr` and `prev` in each iteration:
   - Calculate `temp` as the maximum of `curr` and `prev + current house value`.
   - Update `prev` to `curr`.
   - Update `curr` to `temp`.
3. After iterating through all the houses, return `curr`, which represents the maximum loot that can be robbed without alerting the police.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
    let prev = 0;
    let curr = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        const temp = Math.max(curr, prev + num);
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }
    
    return curr;
};

```
