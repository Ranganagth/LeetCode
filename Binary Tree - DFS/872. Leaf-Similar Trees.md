[872. Leaf-Similar Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/)
# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to traverse each tree and collect the leaf values in a list. By comparing the two lists, we can determine if the trees are leaf-similar.

# Approach
1. Implement a helper function to perform DFS on a tree and collect leaf values.
2. Call this helper function on both trees to get their respective leaf sequences.
3. Compare the two leaf sequences to determine if they are the same.

# Explanation
To determine if two binary trees are leaf-similar, we need to compare their leaf value sequences. A leaf value sequence is obtained by traversing the tree and collecting the values of the leaf nodes (nodes with no children) in left-to-right order.

We can solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Traverse the trees to collect leaf sequences**: We will use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse each tree and collect the leaf nodes' values.
2. **Compare the two leaf sequences**: Once we have the leaf sequences from both trees, we simply compare them to check if they are identical.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in each tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack during DFS. In the worst case, \( h \) can be \( n \) (for a skewed tree).

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function leafSimilar(root1: TreeNode | null, root2: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    function getLeafSequence(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
        const leaves: number[] = [];
        function dfs(node: TreeNode | null): void {
            if (!node) return;
            if (!node.left && !node.right) {
                leaves.push(node.val);
            } else {
                dfs(node.left);
                dfs(node.right);
            }
        }
        dfs(root);
        return leaves;
    }

    const leaves1 = getLeafSequence(root1);
    const leaves2 = getLeafSequence(root2);

    if (leaves1.length !== leaves2.length) return false;

    for (let i = 0; i < leaves1.length; i++) {
        if (leaves1[i] !== leaves2[i]) return false;
    }

    return true;
}
```

In this code:
1. `TreeNode` class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. `leafSimilar` function checks if two trees are leaf-similar.
3. `getLeafSequence` is a helper function that performs DFS to collect leaf values.
4. We collect the leaf sequences for both trees and compare them to determine if they are identical.
