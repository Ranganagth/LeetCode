[1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
To determine if a node is good, we need to compare its value against the maximum value seen so far on the path from the root to that node. If the node's value is greater than or equal to this maximum value, it is a good node. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and maintain the maximum value encountered so far.

# Explanation 
To solve the problem of finding the number of good nodes in a binary tree, we need to traverse the tree and keep track of the maximum value encountered on the path from the root to the current node. A node is considered good if its value is greater than or equal to this maximum value.

# Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We'll use DFS to traverse the tree. At each node, we'll check if its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value encountered on the path from the root.
2. **Update Maximum Value**: During the DFS traversal, update the maximum value whenever a node with a higher value is encountered.
3. **Count Good Nodes**: If the current node is a good node (i.e., its value is greater than or equal to the maximum value), increment the count of good nodes.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack during DFS. In the worst case, \( h \) can be \( n \) (for a skewed tree).

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function goodNodes(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null, maxVal: number): number {
        if (node === null) return 0;

        let goodCount = 0;
        if (node.val >= maxVal) {
            goodCount = 1;
            maxVal = node.val;
        }

        goodCount += dfs(node.left, maxVal);
        goodCount += dfs(node.right, maxVal);

        return goodCount;
    }

    return dfs(root, root ? root.val : Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER);
}
```

> In this code:
1. `TreeNode` class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. `goodNodes` function computes the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
3. `dfs` is a helper function that performs a depth-first traversal of the tree, updating the maximum value encountered and counting good nodes.
