[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
1. **Base Cases**: If we reach a null node, we return null, indicating that neither \( p \) nor \( q \) is found in this subtree. If the current node is either \( p \) or \( q \), we return the current node.
2. **Recursive Search**: Recursively search the left and right subtrees.
3. **Determine LCA**:
   - If both left and right recursive calls return non-null values, it means \( p \) and \( q \) are found in different subtrees of the current node, making the current node their LCA.
   - If only one of the recursive calls returns a non-null value, it means both \( p \) and \( q \) are located in one subtree, and we propagate the non-null return value upwards.

# Approach
1. Implement a recursive helper function that traverses the tree.
2. For each node, check the left and right subtrees for the presence of \( p \) and \( q \).
3. Use the results from the left and right subtrees to determine the LCA.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We need to visit each node once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

# Code
Here is the TypeScript implementation of the solution:

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode | null, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode): TreeNode | null {
    if (!root || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }

    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    if (left && right) {
        return root;
    }

    return left ? left : right;
}
```

In this code:
1. **TreeNode**: Class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **lowestCommonAncestor**: Function that computes the LCA of two given nodes \( p \) and \( q \).
3. **Recursive Search**: The function performs a recursive search in both left and right subtrees, checking for the presence of \( p \) and \( q \) and determining the LCA based on the results from the subtrees.

> This approach efficiently finds the LCA by leveraging the properties of the binary tree and recursive traversal, ensuring that we visit each node only once.
