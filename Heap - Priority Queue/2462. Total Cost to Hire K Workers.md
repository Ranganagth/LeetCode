[2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-cost-to-hire-k-workers/)


# Intuition:

To solve the problem of hiring exactly `k` workers under the given rules, we can use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently select the workers with the lowest costs. The key idea is to maintain two segments of the `costs` array:
- The first `candidates` workers, which are considered from the start.
- The last `candidates` workers, which are considered from the end.

During each hiring session:
1. We choose the worker with the smallest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers.
2. We maintain this selection until exactly `k` workers are hired.

# Approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a min-heap (`MinPriorityQueue`) to store workers based on their costs and indices.
   - Compute the initial segments:
     - Enqueue the first `candidates` workers into the min-heap.
     - Enqueue the last `candidates` workers into the min-heap.

2. **Selection Process**:
   - For each hiring session (loop `k` times):
     - Dequeue the worker with the lowest cost from the min-heap.
     - Add the cost of the selected worker to `totalCost`.
     - Determine the next worker to enqueue into the min-heap:
       - If there are more workers from the beginning segment (`nextHead`), enqueue the next worker from that segment.
       - If there are more workers from the ending segment (`nextTail`), enqueue the next worker from that segment.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If there are fewer than `candidates` workers left to choose from, simply take the smallest remaining worker.

4. **Termination**:
   - Continue the above process until exactly `k` workers are hired.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Inserting the initial segments into the min-heap takes \(O(candidates \log candidates)\).
  - Each dequeue operation and enqueue operation take \(O(\log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of workers.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O((candidates + k) \log candidates)\).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the min-heap which can store up to `candidates` workers.

# Code

```typescript
function totalCost(costs: number[], k: number, candidates: number): number {
    const minPq = new MinPriorityQueue<{ cost: number; index: number }>({
        compare: (a, b) => a.cost === b.cost ? a.index - b.index : a.cost - b.cost,
    });

    let totalCost: number = 0;
    let nextHead: number = candidates;
    let nextTail: number = costs.length - candidates;

    for (let i = 0; i < candidates; i++) {
        minPq.enqueue({ cost: costs[i], index: i });
    }

    for (let i = Math.max(candidates, costs.length - candidates); i < costs.length; i++) {
        minPq.enqueue({ cost: costs[i], index: i });
    }

    while (k-- > 0) {
        const element = minPq.dequeue().element;
        totalCost += element.cost;

        if (nextHead <= nextTail) {
            const nextWorker = element.index < nextHead ?
                { index: nextHead, cost: costs[nextHead++] } :
                { index: nextTail, cost: costs[nextTail--] };

            minPq.enqueue(nextWorker);
        }
    }

    return totalCost;
};
