[1268. Search Suggestions System](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-suggestions-system/)

# Intuition

The given code snippet implements a Trie data structure and uses it to efficiently suggest products based on a search word. The Trie (prefix tree) is used to store all the products, and then for each character of the search word, it searches the Trie to find products that match the prefix formed by the characters typed so far.

# Approach

1. **TrieNode Definition**:

   - A `TrieNode` is defined as an object with:
     - `children`: An array of 26 possible children nodes (for each letter from 'a' to 'z').
     - `indices`: An array that stores indices of products that match the prefix up to the current node.

2. **createTrieNode Function**:

   - Initializes a `TrieNode` with an array of 26 elements (for 'a' to 'z') and an empty array for `indices`.

3. **Insert Function**:

   - **Purpose**: Inserts a word into the Trie.
   - **Steps**:
     - Start from the root of the Trie.
     - For each character in the word, calculate its index ('a' = 0, 'b' = 1, ..., 'z' = 25).
     - If the child node corresponding to the character doesn't exist, create a new node.
     - Update the current node to move to the child node.
     - Push the current word index into the `indices` array of the current node, limited to 3 indices (the top 3 lexicographically smallest products).

4. **Search Function**:

   - **Purpose**: Searches prefixes in the Trie and returns the indices of words.
   - **Steps**:
     - Start from the root of the Trie.
     - For each character in the prefix, calculate its index.
     - If the child node corresponding to the character doesn't exist, break the loop.
     - Update the current node to move to the child node.
     - Clone the `indices` array of the current node using the spread operator and push it to the `results` array.

5. **Suggested Products Function**:
   - **Purpose**: Sorts products lexicographically, inserts them into the Trie using the `insert` function, and then uses the `search` function to find and return the suggested products based on each character of the search word.
   - **Steps**:
     - Sort the products lexicographically.
     - Insert each product into the Trie using its index.
     - For each character in the search word, use the `search` function to find the indices of the products that match the prefix formed so far.
     - Convert the indices to actual product names and store them in the `suggestions` array.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Insert Operation**: O(m), where m is the length of the word being inserted. This is because each character of the word is processed once.
  - **Search Operation**: O(n), where n is the length of the prefix. This is because each character of the prefix is processed once.
  - **Suggested Products Operation**: O(n \* m), where n is the length of the search word and m is the average length of the products. This is because for each character in the search word, the `search` function is called, which can take up to O(m) time.
  - **Sorting**: O(p \* log(p)), where p is the number of products, due to the sorting of products.
- **Space Complexity**: O(p \* m), where p is the number of products and m is the average length of the products. This is because we need space to store the Trie and the indices for each node.

# Code

```typescript
interface TrieNode {
  children: Array<TrieNode | null>;
  indices: number[];
}

const createTrieNode = (): TrieNode => ({
  children: new Array(26).fill(null),
  indices: [],
});

const trieRoot: TrieNode = createTrieNode();

function insert(word: string, wordIndex: number): void {
  let node: TrieNode = trieRoot;

  for (const ch of word) {
    const index = ch.charCodeAt(0) - "a".charCodeAt(0);

    if (!node.children[index]) {
      node.children[index] = createTrieNode();
    }

    node = node.children[index] as TrieNode;

    if (node.indices.length < 3) {
      node.indices.push(wordIndex);
    }
  }
}

function search(prefix: string): Array<number[]> {
  let node: TrieNode = trieRoot;
  const results: Array<number[]> = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < prefix.length; ++i) {
    const index = prefix[i].charCodeAt(0) - "a".charCodeAt(0);
    if (!node.children[index]) {
      break;
    }

    node = node.children[index] as TrieNode;
    results.push([...node.indices]);
  }

  return results;
}

function suggestedProducts(products: string[], searchWord: string): string[][] {
  products.sort();

  products.forEach((product, index) => {
    insert(product, index);
  });

  const suggestions: string[][] = [];
  const indicesList = search(searchWord);

  for (const indices of indicesList) {
    const temp: string[] = [];
    for (const idx of indices) {
      temp.push(products[idx]);
    }
    suggestions.push(temp);
  }

  return suggestions;
}
```

> This solution efficiently computes the suggestions for each character typed in `searchWord` using sorting and binary search techniques, ensuring that the suggestions are provided in a timely manner.
