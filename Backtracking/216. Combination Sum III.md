[216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/)

# Intuition

This is a classic backtracking problem. We need to explore all possible combinations of numbers from 1 to 9, check if they sum up to `n`, and ensure that the combination length is `k`.

# Approach

1. **Backtracking Setup:**
   - We will use a backtracking function to try all possible combinations.
   - The function will keep track of the current combination, the remaining sum, and the starting point for the next number to avoid using the same number multiple times.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If the length of the current combination equals `k` and the sum of the combination is `n`, we add this combination to the result list.
   - If the sum exceeds `n` or the combination length exceeds `k`, we backtrack.

3. **Recursive Exploration:**
   - We iterate through numbers from the current starting point to 9.
   - For each number, we add it to the current combination, adjust the remaining sum, and recursively call the function to continue building the combination.
# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is ***O(2^n)*** because in the worst case, we explore all subsets of the set of numbers from 1 to 9. However, since `n` is fixed at 9, this complexity is manageable.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is ***O(k)*** for the recursion stack and the combination storage, where `k` is the number of elements in the combination.

# Code

```typescript
function combinationSum3(k: number, n: number): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];

    function backtrack(start: number, currentCombination: number[], remainingSum: number): void {
        if (currentCombination.length === k && remainingSum === 0) {
            result.push([...currentCombination]);
            return;
        }

        if (currentCombination.length > k || remainingSum < 0) {
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i <= 9; i++) {
            currentCombination.push(i);
            backtrack(i + 1, currentCombination, remainingSum - i);
            currentCombination.pop(); 
        }
    }

    backtrack(1, [], n);

    return result;
};

```
