[700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

# Intuition
To find the node in the BST with the given value `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node, we can perform a simple traversal of the BST to find the node with the given value.

# Approach
1. **Traversal**: Traverse the BST to find the node with the given value `val`.
2. **Return Subtree**: If the node with the value `val` is found, return the subtree rooted with that node; otherwise, return `null`.

# Complexity
Since the BST is balanced, 
- The `Time complexity` for finding the node with the given value is ***O(log n)*** on average, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the BST. 
	- The `worst-case time complexity` is ***O(n)*** when the BST is skewed. 
- The space complexity is ***O(h)***, where ***h*** is the height of the tree.

# Code 
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function searchBST(root: TreeNode | null, val: number): TreeNode | null {
    if (!root) return null;

    if (root.val === val) {
        return root;
    } else if (root.val > val) {
        return searchBST(root.left, val);
    } else {
        return searchBST(root.right, val);
    }
};

```

In this implementation:
- We perform a traversal of the BST to find the node with the value `val`.
- If the node with the value `val` is found, we return the subtree rooted with that node; otherwise, we return `null`.
