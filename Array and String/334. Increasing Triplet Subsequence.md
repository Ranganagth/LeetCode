[334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using a single pass through the array. We will keep track of the minimum and second minimum elements found so far. If we find a number greater than the second minimum, we return true.

# Approach
1. Initialize two variables `min` and `secondMin` to `Infinity`.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`.
3. If the current number `nums[i]` is less than `min`, update `min` to `nums[i]`.
4. If `nums[i]` is greater than `min` but less than `secondMin`, update `secondMin` to `nums[i]`.
5. If we find a number greater than `secondMin`, return true.
6. After the loop, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function increasingTriplet(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let min = Infinity;
    let secondMin = Infinity;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num <= min) {
            min = num;
        } else if (num <= secondMin) {
            secondMin = num;
        } else {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};
