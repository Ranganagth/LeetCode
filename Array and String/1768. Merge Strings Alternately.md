[1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/)

# Intuition
To merge two strings by adding letters in alternating order, we can use two pointers to iterate over the characters of both strings. We'll append the characters to a result string in alternating order.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` for `word1` and `j` for `word2`, both starting at 0.
2. Iterate through both strings until both pointers reach the end of their respective strings.
3. Append the character at `i` index of `word1` to the result string, then increment `i`.
4. Append the character at `j` index of `word2` to the result string, then increment `j`.
5. If there are remaining characters in `word1` or `word2`, append them to the result string.
6. Return the merged string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```typescript
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
    let mergedString = "";
    let i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < word1.length && j < word2.length) {
        mergedString += word1[i++];
        mergedString += word2[j++];
    }

    while (i < word1.length) {
        mergedString += word1[i++];
    }

    while (j < word2.length) {
        mergedString += word2[j++];
    }

    return mergedString;
};
