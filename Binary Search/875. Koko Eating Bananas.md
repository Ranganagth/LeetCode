[875. Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

# Intuition:
To solve the problem of finding the minimum bananas-per-hour eating speed *k* such that Koko can finish eating all the bananas within *h* hours, we can use a binary search approach. 

# Approach:

1. **Binary Search Method:**
   - **Objective:** We need to find the minimum *k* such that Koko can eat all bananas within *h* hours.
   - **Binary Search Setup:**
     - Initialize the search bounds:
       - **Left bound (`left`)**: Minimum speed is 1.
       - **Right bound (`right`)**: Maximum speed is the maximum number of bananas in any pile (`max(piles)`).
     - Use binary search to find the minimum *k*.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Calculate the middle value *k* (`mid`).
   - For each *k*, calculate the total hours required to eat all bananas using the formula:
    ```
     hours_required = sum(ceil(pile / k) for pile in piles)
     ```
    - This can be computed as `ceil(pile / k) = (pile + k - 1) // k` using integer arithmetic.
   - If the calculated hours are less than or equal to *h*, then it's possible to eat all bananas in *h* hours, so we search for smaller *k* (move `right` to `mid`).
   - If the calculated hours exceed *h*, then *k* is too small, and we need to increase *k* (move `left` to `mid + 1`).

3. **Termination:**
   - The search terminates when `left` equals `right`. At this point, `left` (or `right`) is the minimum *k* that satisfies the condition.

4. **Result:**
   - Return `left` (or `right`), which is the minimum *k*.

# Explanation:

- **`minEatingSpeed` Function:**
  - Initializes `left` and `right` for binary search.
  - Executes binary search to find the minimum `k` using the `canEatAll` function.
  - Returns `left`, which is the minimum `k` found.

- **`canEatAll` Function:**
  - Calculates the total hours required to eat all bananas with a given `k`.
  - Iterates through each pile of bananas and calculates the hours using the formula [plie/k].
  - Returns `true` if the total hours required is less than or equal to `h`, otherwise returns `false`.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n log max_pile)***, where *n* is the number of piles and `max_pile` is the maximum number of bananas in any pile. Binary search is ***O(log max_pile)*** and computing the total hours for each `k` is *O(n)*.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)***.

# Code:

```typescript
function minEatingSpeed(piles: number[], h: number): number {
    let left = 1;
    let right = Math.max(...piles);
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canEatAll(piles, h, mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
}

function canEatAll(piles: number[], h: number, k: number): boolean {
    let hoursRequired = 0;
    for (let pile of piles) {
        hoursRequired += Math.ceil(pile / k);
    }
    return hoursRequired <= h;
};

```

> This approach efficiently finds the minimum eating speed *k* using binary search, ensuring that the solution runs in ***O(n log max_pile)*** time, which is suitable given the problem constraints.
