[1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-routes-to-make-all-paths-lead-to-the-city-zero/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph and count the number of edges that need to be reversed to reorder the cities. We'll keep track of the direction of each edge to determine whether it needs to be reversed.

# Approach
1. **Initialize the Graph:** We represent the graph as an adjacency list where each node is associated with a list of its neighboring nodes and the direction of the edges.
2. **Perform DFS:** We perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from city 0 and count the number of edges that need to be reversed. During the DFS, we mark visited cities to avoid revisiting them.
3. **Count Reorders:** For each edge encountered during the DFS, we check its direction. If the direction is wrong (opposite to the desired direction), we increment the reorder count.
4. **Return Result:** Finally, we return the total number of reorders needed.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(N)***, where N is the number of cities. 
  - Building the graph takes ***O(N + E)*** time, where E is the number of connections.
  - The DFS traversal also takes ***O(N + E)*** time.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(N + E)***, where N is the number of cities and E is the number of connections.
  - We use a graph represented as an adjacency list, which requires ***O(N + E)*** space.
  - Additionally, the visited array for DFS requires ***O(N)*** space.

# Code
- The `minReorder` function initializes the graph and starts the DFS traversal from city 0.
- The `dfs` function performs the depth-first search and calculates the number of reorders needed.

```typescript
type Graph = Map<number, Array<[number, boolean]>>;

function minReorder(n: number, connections: number[][]): number {
    const graph: Graph = new Map();

    connections.forEach(connection => {
        const [source, destination] = connection;
      
        if (!graph.has(source)) {
            graph.set(source, []);
        }
        graph.get(source)!.push([destination, true]); 
      
        if (!graph.has(destination)) {
            graph.set(destination, []);
        }
        graph.get(destination)!.push([source, false]); 
    });

    const visited: boolean[] = Array(n).fill(false);

    return dfs(0, graph, visited);
}

function dfs(currentNode: number, graph: Graph, visited: boolean[]): number {
    visited[currentNode] = true;

    let reorderCount: number = 0;

    if (graph.has(currentNode)) {
        graph.get(currentNode)!.forEach(neighbor => {
            const [nextNode, edgeDirection] = neighbor;
          
            if (!visited[nextNode]) {
                if (edgeDirection) {
                    reorderCount++;
                }
                reorderCount += dfs(nextNode, graph, visited);
            }
        });
    }

    return reorderCount;
};

```
