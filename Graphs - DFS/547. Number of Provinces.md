[547. Number of Provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to find the connected cities. We'll start from each city and visit all the connected cities. Each time we find a new province, we'll increment the province count.

# Approach:
1. Create a visited set to keep track of visited cities.
2. Iterate through each city (i.e., each row in the `isConnected` matrix).
3. For each unvisited city, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to visit all the connected cities.
4. Increment the province count each time we find a new province.

# Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(nÂ²)*** where n is the number of cities.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)*** for the visited set.

# Code
```typescript
function findCircleNum(isConnected: number[][]): number {
    const n = isConnected.length;
    const visited = new Set<number>();
    let provinces = 0;

    function dfs(city: number) {
        visited.add(city);
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (isConnected[city][j] === 1 && !visited.has(j)) {
                dfs(j);
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!visited.has(i)) {
            dfs(i);
            provinces++;
        }
    }

    return provinces;
};

```

> This implementation ensures that we visit all the connected cities and count the number of provinces using depth-first search (DFS). We return the total number of provinces found.
