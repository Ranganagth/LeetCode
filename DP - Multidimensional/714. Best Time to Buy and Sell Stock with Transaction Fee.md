[714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)


# Intuition:
To maximize profit while considering transaction fees, we need to carefully track two states for each day: whether we hold a stock (`hold`) or not (`cash`). By defining these states, we can systematically update them based on the decisions we make at each step.

# Approach:

1. **Define States:**
   - We'll use two variables `cash` and `hold` to represent the maximum profit we can have if we don't hold any stock or if we hold a stock respectively.
   - `cash[i]` will denote the maximum profit on day `i` if we don't hold any stock after all transactions.
   - `hold[i]` will denote the maximum profit on day `i` if we hold a stock after all transactions.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cash[0]` should be `0` because if we don't do any transaction, profit is `0`.
   - `hold[0]` should be `-prices[0]` because if we buy stock at the first day, our profit will be negative of the price.

3. **Transition Relations:**
   - If we don't hold any stock at day `i`, we can either continue not holding any stock (carry forward `cash[i-1]`), or buy a stock on day `i` (which means we subtract `prices[i]` and pay the fee):
     ```
     cash[i] = Math.max(cash[i-1], hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee)
     ```
   - If we hold a stock at day `i`, we can either continue holding it (carry forward `hold[i-1]`), or sell it (which means we add `prices[i]` to our profit):
     ```
     hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i-1], cash[i-1] - prices[i])
     ```

4. **Final Computation:**
   - The maximum profit on the last day `n-1` will be `cash[n-1]` because we want to end with no stock in hand.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***. We iterate through the prices array once.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)***. We use only constant extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[], fee: number): number {
    const n = prices.length;
    if (n <= 1) return 0;
    
    let cash = 0;
    let hold = -prices[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        const prevCash = cash;
        const prevHold = hold;
        
        cash = Math.max(prevCash, prevHold + prices[i] - fee);
        hold = Math.max(prevHold, prevCash - prices[i]);
    }
    
    return cash;
};

```
