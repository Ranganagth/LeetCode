[933. Number of Recent Calls](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/)

# Intuition
We can use a queue to store the timestamps of recent requests. When a new request comes in, we add its timestamp to the queue and then remove timestamps that are older than 3000 milliseconds.

# Approach
1. Initialize an empty queue to store the timestamps of recent requests.
2. When a new request comes in at time `t`, add `t` to the queue.
3. Remove timestamps from the queue that are older than 3000 milliseconds (i.e., `t - 3000`).
4. Return the number of timestamps remaining in the queue, which represents the number of recent requests in the past 3000 milliseconds.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: ***O(1)*** for each `ping` operation.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of recent requests in the past 3000 milliseconds. In the worst case, the queue can contain up to 3000 elements. 

# Code
```typescript
class RecentCounter {
    private requests: number[];

    constructor() {
        this.requests = [];
    }

    ping(t: number): number {
        this.requests.push(t);
        while (this.requests[0] < t - 3000) {
            this.requests.shift();
        }
        return this.requests.length;
    }
};
