[643. Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using a sliding window approach. We'll initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, and use them to define the window of size `k`. We'll keep track of the sum of elements within the window and update the maximum average accordingly.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `maxSum` to store the sum of the first `k` elements of the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements of the array and store it in `maxSum`.
3. Iterate through the array from index `k` to `nums.length - 1`.
   - Subtract the element at index `left` from `maxSum`.
   - Move `left` pointer one step to the right.
   - Add the element at index `right` to `maxSum`.
   - Update the maximum average if the current average is greater than the previous maximum average.
4. After the loop, return `maxSum / k`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function findMaxAverage(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let maxSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        maxSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    let currentSum = maxSum;
    for (let left = 0, right = k; right < nums.length; left++, right++) {
        currentSum = currentSum - nums[left] + nums[right];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    
    return maxSum / k;
};
