[1207. Unique Number of Occurrences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem by using a hashmap to store the frequency of each value in the array. Then, we'll check if the number of occurrences of each value is unique.

# Approach
1. Initialize a hashmap `frequencyMap` to store the frequency of each value in the array.
2. Iterate through the array `arr` and update the frequency of each value in `frequencyMap`.
3. Initialize a set `occurrences` to store the number of occurrences of each value.
4. Iterate through the values in `frequencyMap` and add their occurrences to the set `occurrences`.
5. If the size of `occurrences` is equal to the size of `frequencyMap`, return true; otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```typescript
function uniqueOccurrences(arr: number[]): boolean {
    const frequencyMap: { [key: number]: number } = {};
    
    for (let num of arr) {
        frequencyMap[num] = (frequencyMap[num] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    const occurrences = new Set(Object.values(frequencyMap));
    
    return occurrences.size === Object.keys(frequencyMap).length;
};

```
