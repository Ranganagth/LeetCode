[2352. Equal Row and Column Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-row-and-column-pairs/)

# Intuition
To find the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal, we can transpose the given grid and then compare each row of the original grid with each column of the transposed grid. If a row and column contain the same elements in the same order, we count it as an equal pair.

# Approach
1. Transpose the original grid to create a new grid where rows become columns and vice versa.
2. Compare each row of the original grid with each column of the transposed grid.
3. If a row and column are identical, increment the count of equal pairs.
4. Return the total count of equal pairs.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n³)***, where n is the size of the grid.
  - Transposing the grid takes ***O(n²)*** time.
  - Comparing each row of the original grid with each column of the transposed grid takes ***O(n²)*** time.
- Space complexity: ***O(n²)*** for storing the transposed grid. 

# Code
```typescript
function equalPairs(grid: number[][]): number {
    const gridSize: number = grid.length;

    let transposedGrid: number[][] = Array.from({ length: gridSize }, () => Array(gridSize).fill(0));

    for (let j = 0; j < gridSize; ++j) {
        for (let i = 0; i < gridSize; ++i) {
            transposedGrid[i][j] = grid[j][i];
        }
    }

    let equalPairsCount: number = 0;

    for (const row of grid) {
        for (const col of transposedGrid) {
            equalPairsCount += Number(row.toString() === col.toString());
        }
    }

    return equalPairsCount;
};
