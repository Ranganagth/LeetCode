[1732. Find the Highest Altitude](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem by simulating the biker's road trip. Starting from altitude 0, we will iterate through the gain array, updating the current altitude by adding the gain at each point. We'll keep track of the highest altitude reached during the trip.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `altitude` to 0 to store the current altitude.
2. Initialize a variable `maxAltitude` to 0 to store the maximum altitude reached during the trip.
3. Iterate through the gain array and update the current altitude by adding the gain at each point.
4. Update `maxAltitude` with the maximum of `maxAltitude` and `altitude`.
5. After the loop, return `maxAltitude`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function largestAltitude(gain: number[]): number {
    let altitude = 0;
    let maxAltitude = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
        altitude += gain[i];
        maxAltitude = Math.max(maxAltitude, altitude);
    }
    
    return maxAltitude;
};

```
