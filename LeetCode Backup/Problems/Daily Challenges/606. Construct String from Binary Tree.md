[Construct String from Binary Tree - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-02)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
You're given the root node of a binary tree, and you're required to create a string representation of the tree following specific formatting rules. The representation should be based on a preorder traversal of the binary tree and must adhere to the following guidelines:

### Node Representation:
Each node in the tree should be represented by its integer value.

### Parentheses for Children:
- If a node has at least one child (either left or right), its children should be represented inside parentheses.
- If a node has a left child, the value of the left child should be enclosed in parentheses immediately following the node's value.
- If a node has a right child, the value of the right child should also be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses for the right child should follow those of the left child.

### Omitting Empty Parentheses:
Any empty parentheses pairs (i.e., `()`) should be omitted from the final string representation of the tree, with one specific exception:
- When a node has a right child but no left child, an empty pair of parentheses must precede the representation of the right child to reflect the tree's structure accurately.

### Example:
For the tree `[1,2,3,4]`, the output should be `"1(2(4))(3)"`.

Explanation: Originally, it needs to be `"1(2(4)())(3()())"`, but you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs. And it will be `"1(2(4))(3)"`.

# Approach
We'll implement a recursive approach using preorder traversal.

### Steps:
1. If the root is null, return an empty string.
2. Construct the string representation of the current node by appending its value.
3. If the node has at least one child, recursively construct the string representation of its left and right children.
4. Apply the formatting rules mentioned above.
    - Omit empty parentheses pairs when a node has only a left child or no children.
    - If a node has a right child but no left child, include an empty pair of parentheses before the representation of the right child.
5. Return the string representation of the subtree rooted at the current node.

# Complexity Analysis
Since each node is processed once, the time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

Let's implement this approach in TypeScript:

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function tree2str(root: TreeNode | null): string {
    if (!root) return '';
    
    const left = tree2str(root.left);
    const right = tree2str(root.right);
    
    if (!left && !right) return `${root.val}`;
    if (!right) return `${root.val}(${left})`;
    return `${root.val}(${left})(${right})`;
};

```
