[Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-positive-integer-that-exists-with-its-negative/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-02)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros, we need to find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array. If there is no such integer, we should return `-1`.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [-1,2,-3,3]`, the output is `3`.
  - `3` is the only valid `k` we can find in the array.
- For `nums = [-1,10,6,7,-7,1]`, the output is `7`.
  - Both `1` and `7` have their corresponding negative values in the array. `7` has a larger value.
- For `nums = [-10,8,6,7,-2,-3]`, the output is `-1`.
  - There is no single valid `k`, so we return `-1`.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `nums` is between `1` and `1000`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is between `-1000` and `1000`.
- `nums[i]` is not `0`.

# Approach
1. Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`:
   - If `-num` exists in `nums` and `num` is positive, update the maximum positive integer `k` found so far.
2. If no such positive integer `k` is found, return `-1`.
3. Otherwise, return the maximum positive integer `k` found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function largestSumTwice(nums: number[]): number {
    let max = -1;
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (nums.includes(-num) && num > 0) {
            max = Math.max(max, num);
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```
