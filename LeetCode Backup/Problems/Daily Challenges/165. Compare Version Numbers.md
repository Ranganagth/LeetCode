[Compare Version Numbers - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-03)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given two version numbers `version1` and `version2`, we need to compare them.

Version numbers consist of one or more revisions joined by a dot `.`. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Revisions are 0-indexed from left to right, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on.

To compare version numbers, we compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their integer value ignoring any leading zeros. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then we treat the revision as 0.

We need to return:
- `-1` if `version1 < version2`,
- `1` if `version1 > version2`,
- `0` if `version1` is equal to `version2`.

### Examples:

- For `version1 = "1.01"` and `version2 = "1.001"`, the output is `0`.
- For `version1 = "1.0"` and `version2 = "1.0.0"`, the output is `0`.
- For `version1 = "0.1"` and `version2 = "1.1"`, the output is `-1`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= version1.length, version2.length <= 500`
- `version1` and `version2` only contain digits and '.'.
- `version1` and `version2` are valid version numbers.
- All the given revisions in `version1` and `version2` can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

# Approach
We can split the version strings by dot (`.`), convert each revision to an integer, and compare them. We'll iterate through the revisions of both version strings simultaneously.

### Steps:
1. Split `version1` and `version2` by dot (`.`).
2. Iterate through the revisions of both versions simultaneously.
3. Convert each revision to an integer and compare them.
4. If the revisions are equal, continue to the next revision.
5. If the revision of `version1` is less than the revision of `version2`, return `-1`.
6. If the revision of `version1` is greater than the revision of `version2`, return `1`.
7. If one version has more revisions than the other, we consider the additional revisions as `0`.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is ***O(n)***, where n is the maximum length of `version1` or `version2`.

# Code

```typescript
function compareVersion(version1: string, version2: string): number {
    const v1 = version1.split('.');
    const v2 = version2.split('.');
    
    const n = Math.max(v1.length, v2.length);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const num1 = i < v1.length ? parseInt(v1[i]) : 0;
        const num2 = i < v2.length ? parseInt(v2[i]) : 0;
        
        if (num1 === num2) continue;
        return num1 < num2 ? -1 : 1;
    }
    
    return 0;
};
```

# Explanation
We split the version strings `version1` and `version2` by dot (`.`) and store the revisions in arrays `v1` and `v2`.

We then iterate through the revisions of both versions simultaneously. We convert each revision to an integer using `parseInt()` and compare them.

- If the revisions are equal, we continue to the next revision.
- If the revision of `version1` is less than the revision of `version2`, we return `-1`.
- If the revision of `version1` is greater than the revision of `version2`, we return `1`.

If one version has more revisions than the other, we consider the additional revisions as 0.

Finally, if no difference is found, we return `0`.
