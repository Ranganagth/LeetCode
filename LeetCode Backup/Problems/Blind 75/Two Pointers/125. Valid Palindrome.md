[Valid Palindrome - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/submissions/1247296648/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given a string `s`, we need to determine if it is a palindrome after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters.

### Examples:
- For `s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`, the output is `true`.
  - After converting to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters, `s` becomes `"amanaplanacanalpanama"`, which is a palindrome.
- For `s = "race a car"`, the output is `false`.
  - After converting to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters, `s` becomes `"raceacar"`, which is not a palindrome.
- For `s = " "`, the output is `true`.
  - `s` is an empty string after removing non-alphanumeric characters. Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

### Constraints:
- The length of the string `s` is between `1` and `2 * 10^5`.
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using a two-pointer approach.

1. **Convert the string `s` to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters.**
2. **Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized at the start and end of the modified string, respectively.**
3. **Move `left` towards the right and `right` towards the left, comparing characters at each step.**
   - **If `s[left]` is not equal to `s[right]`, return `false`.**
4. **If the loop completes without returning `false`, return `true`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the string once, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space complexity:** We use extra space for the modified string, which requires ***O(n)*** space, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

# Code

```typescript
function isPalindrome(s: string): boolean {
    s = s.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, '');
    
    let left = 0, right = s.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] !== s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return true;
};
```
