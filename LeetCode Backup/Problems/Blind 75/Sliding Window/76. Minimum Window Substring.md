[Minimum Window Substring - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, we need to find the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, we return an empty string.

### Examples:
- For `s = "ADOBECODEBANC"` and `t = "ABC"`, the output is `"BANC"`.
  - The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string `t`.
- For `s = "a"` and `t = "a"`, the output is `"a"`.
  - The entire string `s` is the minimum window.
- For `s = "a"` and `t = "aa"`, the output is `""`.
  - Both 'a's from `t` must be included in the window. Since the largest window of `s` only has one 'a', we return an empty string.

### Constraints:
- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique with the help of two pointers, `left` and `right`.

1. **Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the window.**
2. **While the `right` pointer is less than the length of the string `s`:**
   - **If the substring from `left` to `right` contains all the characters in `t`, update the minimum window found so far.**
   - **Move the `right` pointer.**
3. **If a valid window is found, move the `left` pointer to find a smaller window.**
4. **Continue this process until the end of the string.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the string once with two pointers, so the time complexity is ***O(m + n)***, where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`.
- **Space complexity:** We use a hash map to store character frequencies, so the space complexity is ***O(m + n)***.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function minWindow(s: string, t: string): string {
    const sFreq: number[] = new Array(128).fill(0);
    const tFreq: number[] = new Array(128).fill(0);
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity;
    let minStart = 0;
    let count = 0;

    // Update t frequency
    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        tFreq[t.charCodeAt(i)]++;
    }

    while (right < s.length) {
        // Update s frequency
        if (tFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)] > 0) {
            sFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)]++;
            if (sFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)] <= tFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // Shrink the window
        while (count === t.length) {
            if (right - left + 1 < minLength) {
                minLength = right - left + 1;
                minStart = left;
            }
            if (tFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)] > 0) {
                sFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)]--;
                if (sFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)] < tFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)]) {
                    count--;
                }
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        right++;
    }
    
    return minLength === Infinity ? "" : s.substring(minStart, minStart + minLength);
};
```

# Explanation
In this problem, we use the sliding window technique to find the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` is included in the window.

We maintain two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the window. As we traverse the string `s` with the `right` pointer, we keep track of the counts of characters in the window. If the substring from `left` to `right` contains all the characters in `t`, we update the minimum window found so far. Then, we move the `left` pointer to find a smaller window. Finally, we return the minimum window substring found.
