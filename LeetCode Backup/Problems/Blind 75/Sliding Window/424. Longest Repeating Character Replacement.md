[Longest Repeating Character Replacement - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, we can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. We can perform this operation at most `k` times.

We need to return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing the above operations.

### Examples:
- For `s = "ABAB"` and `k = 2`, the output is `4`.
  - We can replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
- For `s = "AABABBA"` and `k = 1`, the output is `4`.
  - We can replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
  - The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is `4`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique.

1. **Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the window.**
2. **While the `right` pointer is less than the length of the string:**
   - **If the number of changes needed to make the substring valid (the number of characters different from the majority character in the window) is greater than `k`:**
     - **Move the `left` pointer and decrement the count of the character at `left`.**
   - **Increment `right`.**
3. **Update the maximum length found during the traversal.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the string once with two pointers, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space complexity:** We use an array to keep track of character counts, so the space complexity is ***O(1)***.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function characterReplacement(s: string, k: number): number {
    let maxCount = 0;
    let left = 0;
    const counts: number[] = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let right = 0; right < s.length; right++) {
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, ++counts[s.charCodeAt(right) - 'A'.charCodeAt(0)]);
        if (right - left + 1 - maxCount > k) {
            counts[s.charCodeAt(left) - 'A'.charCodeAt(0)]--;
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return Math.min(s.length, maxCount + k);
};

```

# Explanation
In this problem, we use the sliding window technique to find the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after performing at most `k` character changes.

We maintain two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the window. As we traverse the string with the `right` pointer, we keep track of the counts of characters in the window. We also keep track of the maximum count of a character (`maxCount`) seen so far. If the number of changes needed to make the substring valid (the number of characters different from the majority character in the window) is greater than `k`, we move the `left` pointer and decrement the count of the character at `left`. Finally, we return the minimum of the length of the string and `maxCount + k`, as we can change at most `k` characters.
