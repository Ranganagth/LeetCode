[Merge Two Sorted Lists - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/)

# Intuition
To merge two sorted linked lists, we can use a pointer for each list and iterate through both lists simultaneously. At each step, we compare the values of the current nodes of the two lists and append the smaller one to the merged list.

# Approach
1. Initialize a dummy head node to simplify the code.
2. Initialize a current pointer to keep track of the last node in the merged list.
3. Iterate through both linked lists simultaneously.
4. At each step, compare the values of the current nodes of list1 and list2.
5. Append the smaller node to the current node and move the pointer of the smaller list to the next node.
6. Repeat this process until we reach the end of one of the lists.
7. Finally, append the remaining nodes of the non-empty list to the merged list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n + m)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in `list1` and ***m*** is the number of nodes in `list2`.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function mergeTwoLists(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode();
    let current = dummyHead;
    
    while (l1 !== null && l2 !== null) {
        if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
            current.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            current.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    current.next = l1 !== null ? l1 : l2;
    
    return dummyHead.next;
};
```
