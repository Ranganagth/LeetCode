[Reorder List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/description/)

# Intuition
To reorder the list, we can follow these steps:
1. Find the middle of the list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Merge the first half and the reversed second half.

# Approach
1. Find the middle of the list using the slow and fast pointer technique.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Merge the first half and the reversed second half by interweaving the nodes.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function reorderList(head: ListNode | null): void {
    if (!head || !head.next) return;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    // Find the middle of the list
    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow!.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    // Reverse the second half of the list
    let prev: ListNode | null = null;
    let curr: ListNode | null = slow;
    let next: ListNode | null = null;

    while (curr) {
        next = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }

    // Merge the first half and the reversed second half
    let firstHalf: ListNode | null = head;
    let secondHalf: ListNode | null = prev;

    while (secondHalf!.next) {
        next = firstHalf!.next;
        firstHalf!.next = secondHalf;
        firstHalf = next;
        
        next = secondHalf!.next;
        secondHalf!.next = firstHalf;
        secondHalf = next;
    }
}
```
