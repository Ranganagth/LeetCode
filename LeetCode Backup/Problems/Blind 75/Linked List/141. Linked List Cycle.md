[Linked List Cycle - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/)

# Intuition
To detect a cycle in a linked list, we can use the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the list, the two pointers will eventually meet.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the list.
2. Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.
3. If there is a cycle, the two pointers will meet at some point.
4. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., it becomes null), there is no cycle.
5. Return true if the two pointers meet; otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the list.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
    if (!head || !head.next) return false;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow!.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;

        if (slow === fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};
