[Top K Frequent Elements - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/submissions/1247291294/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, we need to return the `k` most frequent elements. We can return the answer in any order.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]` and `k = 2`, the output is `[1,2]`.
  - The most frequent elements are `1` and `2`.
- For `nums = [1]` and `k = 1`, the output is `[1]`.
  - The only element in the array is the most frequent.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `nums` is between `1` and `10^5`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is between `-10^4` and `10^4`.
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using a hashmap to store the frequency of each element, and then use a min-heap to get the `k` most frequent elements efficiently.

1. **Create an empty hashmap `frequency` to store the frequency of each element.**
2. **Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums` and update its frequency in the `frequency` hashmap.**
3. **Create a min-heap `heap` to store elements based on their frequency.**
4. **Iterate through each unique element `num` and its frequency `freq` in the `frequency` hashmap:**
   - **Push `[num, freq]` to the `heap`.**
   - **If the size of the `heap` exceeds `k`, pop the element with the minimum frequency.**
5. **Return the `k` most frequent elements from the `heap`.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the array once to calculate the frequency, which takes ***O(n)*** time. Building the heap takes ***O(k \log k)*** time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is ***O(n + k \log k)***. Since `k` is guaranteed to be smaller than `n`, the time complexity is effectively ***O(n)***.
- **Space complexity:** We use extra space for the hashmap and the heap. The space complexity is ***O(n)***.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function topKFrequent(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const frequency = new Map<number, number>();
    for (const num of nums) {
        frequency.set(num, (frequency.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const heap: [number, number][] = [];
    for (const [num, freq] of frequency) {
        heap.push([num, freq]);
        if (heap.length > k) {
            heap.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
            heap.shift();
        }
    }
    
    return heap.map(pair => pair[0]);
};
