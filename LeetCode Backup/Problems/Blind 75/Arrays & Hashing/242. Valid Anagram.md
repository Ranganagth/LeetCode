[Valid Anagram - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/submissions/1247277255/)
# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given two strings `s` and `t`, we need to return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Examples:
- For `s = "anagram"` and `t = "nagaram"`, the output is `true`.
  - The string `t` is an anagram of `s`.
- For `s = "rat"` and `t = "car"`, the output is `false`.
  - The string `t` is not an anagram of `s`.

### Constraints:
- The lengths of the strings `s` and `t` are between `1` and `5 * 10^4`.
- Both `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

# Approach
1. Create two frequency maps `freqS` and `freqT` to store the frequency of characters in strings `s` and `t`, respectively.
2. Iterate through each character `ch` in the string `s` and update `freqS[ch]`.
3. Iterate through each character `ch` in the string `t` and update `freqT[ch]`.
4. If `freqS` is equal to `freqT`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***, since the frequency maps have a fixed size of `26` characters.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function isAnagram(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    if (s.length !== t.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const freqS = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const freqT = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        freqS[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
        freqT[t.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (freqS[i] !== freqT[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
```
