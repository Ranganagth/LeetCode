[Product of Array Except Self - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an integer array `nums`, we need to return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, the output is `[24,12,8,6]`.
  - The product of all elements except `nums[0]` is `2*3*4 = 24`, the product of all elements except `nums[1]` is `1*3*4 = 12`, and so on.
- For `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`, the output is `[0,0,9,0,0]`.
  - The product of all elements except `nums[0]` is `1*0*-3*3 = 0`, the product of all elements except `nums[1]` is `-1*0*-3*3 = 0`, and so on.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `nums` is between `2` and `10^5`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is between `-30` and `30`.
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

# Approach
We can solve this problem without using the division operation by using two passes.

1. **In the first pass, calculate the product of all elements to the left of each element and store it in the `answer` array.**
2. **In the second pass, calculate the product of all elements to the right of each element and multiply it with the corresponding element in the `answer` array.**
3. **Return the `answer` array.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We perform two passes over the array, so the time complexity is $$O(n)$$, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Space complexity:** We use the `answer` array to store the result, which requires $$O(n)$$ extra space, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function productExceptSelf(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const n = nums.length;
    const answer: number[] = new Array(n);
    
    answer[0] = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        answer[i] = answer[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
    }
    
    let rightProduct = 1;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        answer[i] *= rightProduct;
        rightProduct *= nums[i];
    }
    
    return answer;
};
```
