[Group Anagrams - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an array of strings `strs`, we need to group the anagrams together. We can return the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Examples:
- For `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`, the output is `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`.
  - The grouped anagrams are `["bat"]`, `["nat","tan"]`, and `["ate","eat","tea"]`.
- For `strs = [""]`, the output is `[[""]]`.
  - There is only one string in the array, so the output is `[[""]]`.
- For `strs = ["a"]`, the output is `[["a"]]`.
  - There is only one string in the array, so the output is `[["a"]]`.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `strs` is between `1` and `10^4`.
- Each string `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

# Approach
We can group anagrams by sorting each string and using the sorted string as a key in a hashmap.

1. **Create an empty hashmap `groups` to store the groups of anagrams.**
2. **Iterate through each string `str` in the array `strs`:**
   - **Sort the characters of `str` to create a key `key`.**
   - **If `key` exists in the `groups` hashmap, push `str` to the corresponding group. Otherwise, create a new group with `str` as the first element.**
3. **Return the values of the `groups` hashmap.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the array once, and for each string, we sort it, which takes ***O(k \log k)*** time, where `k` is the maximum length of a string in `strs`. Therefore, the overall time complexity is ***O(nk \log k)***, where `n` is the length of the array `strs`.
- **Space complexity:** We use a hashmap to store groups of anagrams, which requires ***O(nk)*** extra space, where `n` is the length of the array `strs` and `k` is the maximum length of a string in `strs`.

Here's the TypeScript code implementing this approach:

```typescript
function groupAnagrams(strs: string[]): string[][] {
    const groups = new Map<string, string[]>();
    for (const str of strs) {
        const key = str.split("").sort().join("");
        if (groups.has(key)) {
            groups.get(key)!.push(str);
        } else {
            groups.set(key, [str]);
        }
    }
    return Array.from(groups.values());
};
```
