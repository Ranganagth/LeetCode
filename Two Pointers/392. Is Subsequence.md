[392. Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using a two-pointer approach. We'll initialize two pointers, one for each string (`sPointer` for `s` and `tPointer` for `t`). We'll iterate through `t`, and whenever the characters at `sPointer` and `tPointer` match, we'll move `sPointer` forward. If `sPointer` reaches the end of `s`, it means `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `sPointer` and `tPointer`, to 0.
2. Iterate through `t` using the `tPointer`.
3. If `s[sPointer]` is equal to `t[tPointer]`, increment `sPointer`.
4. After the loop, if `sPointer` is equal to the length of `s`, return true; otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function isSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    let sPointer = 0;
    let tPointer = 0;

    while (tPointer < t.length && sPointer < s.length) {
        if (s[sPointer] === t[tPointer]) {
            sPointer++;
        }
        tPointer++;
    }

    return sPointer === s.length;
};
