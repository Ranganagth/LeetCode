[79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

# Intuition
To solve the problem of determining whether a given word exists in an m x n grid of characters, where the word can be formed by adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically), we can utilize a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. DFS is suitable here because it explores all possible paths and backtracks when a path leads to a dead end.

# Approach
1. **DFS Function**:
   - Implement a recursive function `dfs` that takes parameters for the current position in the grid (`row` and `col`), the current index of the word being matched (`index`), and returns a boolean indicating whether the word was found starting from this position.
   - Base Case: If `index` equals the length of the `word`, then the entire word has been matched, so return true.
   - Check if the current position is out of bounds or if the character in the board does not match the current character in `word[index]`. If so, return false.
   - Mark the current position as visited by temporarily changing the character to a non-alphabetic character (e.g., `#`).
   - Recursively try to match the next character in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
   - If any direction returns true, propagate true upwards.
   - Unmark the current position after exploring all paths to allow backtracking.

2. **Iterate Over All Cells**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the board.
   - For each cell, start the DFS process to check if the word can be found starting from that cell.
   - If any call to `dfs` returns true, immediately return true.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle edge cases where the word is empty or the board is empty.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is ***O(m × n × 4ᴸ)***, where *m* and *n* are the dimensions of the board and *L* is the length of the word. This is because for each cell, we potentially explore up to 4 directions in the worst case (up, down, left, right), and each exploration can go up to the length of the word.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(L)*** due to the recursive stack space used by the DFS function.

# Code
```typescript
function exist(board: string[][], word: string): boolean {
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;
    const directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]];

    function dfs(row: number, col: number, index: number): boolean {
        if (index === word.length) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols || board[row][col] !== word[index]) {
            return false;
        }

        const temp = board[row][col];
        board[row][col] = '#';

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            if (dfs(row + dx, col + dy, index + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        board[row][col] = temp;
        return false;
    }

    for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
            if (dfs(row, col, 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```
