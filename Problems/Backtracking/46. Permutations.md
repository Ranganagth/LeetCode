[46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to generate all unique permutations of an array of distinct integers. Backtracking is an appropriate approach for generating permutations as it systematically explores all potential candidates for each position in the permutation.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking Setup**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all permutations.
   - Use a `used` array to keep track of which elements have been used in the current permutation.
   - Use a `path` array to build the current permutation.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the `path` array reaches the same length as the input array `nums`, add a copy of `path` to the result.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through each element in `nums`.
   - If an element has not been used (`used[i] === false`), mark it as used, add it to `path`, and recursively build the permutation.
   - After exploring that branch of recursion, backtrack by marking the element as unused and removing it from `path`.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the `result` array which contains all permutations.

# Complexity 
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n * n!)***, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because there are `n!` permutations, and it takes `O(n)` time to build each permutation.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n * n!)***, as the output space is `n!` permutations, each of length `n`.

# Code

```typescript
function permute(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const used: boolean[] = new Array(nums.length).fill(false);
    const path: number[] = [];

    function backtrack() {
        if (path.length === nums.length) {
            result.push([...path]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (!used[i]) {
                used[i] = true;
                path.push(nums[i]);
                backtrack();
                path.pop();
                used[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    backtrack();
    return result;
};
