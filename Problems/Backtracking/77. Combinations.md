[77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to generate all combinations of `k` numbers from the range `[1, n]`. This can be achieved using a backtracking approach, where we build the combinations step by step and backtrack whenever we reach a combination of the desired length or exhaust all possibilities.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking**: Use a helper function to recursively build combinations.
   - Start with an empty combination.
   - Add numbers from the current position to `n`.
   - If the combination reaches the length `k`, add it to the result list.
   - If not, continue adding numbers recursively.
   - After exploring each number, backtrack by removing the last added number and try the next possibility.
2. **Base Case**: If the combination length reaches `k`, add it to the result list.

# Explanation
1. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function that takes the current combination, the start number, and the current position.
2. **Loop Through Numbers**: From the current start number to `n`, add each number to the current combination.
3. **Recursive Call**: Make a recursive call to add the next number.
4. **Backtracking**: Remove the last number added and continue with the next number.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The total number of combinations is C(n, k) which is `n! / (k! * (n - k)!)`. For each combination, we spend O(k) time to build it. Thus, the overall time complexity is ***O(C(n, k) * k)***.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(k)*** for the recursion stack and the combination storage.

# Code
```TypeScript
function combine(n: number, k: number): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    
    const backtrack = (start: number, current: number[]) => {
        if (current.length === k) {
            result.push([...current]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i <= n; i++) {
            current.push(i);
            backtrack(i + 1, current);
            current.pop();
        }
    };

    backtrack(1, []);
    return result;
};
