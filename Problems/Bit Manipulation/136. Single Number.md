[136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

# Intuition
To find the single number that appears only once in the array while all other numbers appear twice, we can use the XOR bitwise operation. The XOR operation has some useful properties:

1. **a ⊕ a = 0**
2. **a ⊕ 0 = a**
3. **a ⊕ b ⊕ a = (a ⊕ a) ⊕ b = 0 ⊕ b = b )**

Using these properties, if we XOR all elements in the array together, the numbers that appear twice will cancel out each other due to property 1, leaving only the single number that appears once.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `singleNumber` to 0.
2. Iterate through all elements in the array.
3. For each element, *XOR* it with `singleNumber`.
4. Return `singleNumber` after the loop finishes.

This approach runs in linear time *O(n)* where *n* is the number of elements in the array, and uses constant extra space *O(1)*.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)*** - We iterate through the array once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)*** - We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function singleNumber(nums: number[]): number {
    let singleNumber = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        singleNumber ^= num;
    }
    return singleNumber;
};

```
