[173. Binary Search Tree Iterator](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-iterator/)

# Intuition
- **In-order Traversal**: For a BST, in-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order. This traversal visits the left subtree, then the node, and finally the right subtree.
- **Stack**: Using a stack helps us to keep track of the nodes yet to be visited and ensures we can traverse the tree iteratively.
  
# Approach
1. **Initialize**: Start from the root and push all the left children onto the stack until we reach a leaf node. This ensures that the smallest element is on top of the stack.
2. **Next**: Pop the top node from the stack (which is the next smallest element), and if it has a right child, push all the left children of the right child onto the stack.
3. **HasNext**: Simply check if the stack is non-empty.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `next()` and `hasNext()` operations are both `O(1)` on average because each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree, which is the space used by the stack.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

class BSTIterator {
    private stack: TreeNode[];

    constructor(root: TreeNode | null) {
        this.stack = [];
        this._leftmostInorder(root);
    }

    private _leftmostInorder(node: TreeNode | null) {
        while (node !== null) {
            this.stack.push(node);
            node = node.left;
        }
    }

    next(): number {
        const topmostNode = this.stack.pop();
        if (topmostNode!.right !== null) {
            this._leftmostInorder(topmostNode!.right);
        }
        return topmostNode!.val;
    }

    hasNext(): boolean {
        return this.stack.length > 0;
    }
};

```

### Explanation
- **Constructor**: Initializes the stack and pushes all left children of the root to set up the iterator.
- **_leftmostInorder**: Helper function to push all left children of a given node onto the stack.
- **Next**: Pops the top node from the stack, pushes its right child's left subtree onto the stack (if it exists), and returns the node's value.
- **HasNext**: Checks if there are any nodes left in the stack to process.
