[321. Create Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-maximum-number/)

# Intuition

The problem can be broken down into a few key steps:
1. **Generate all possible subsequences** of a given length from each array.
2. **Merge the subsequences** from both arrays to form the maximum number of length `k`.
3. **Select the optimal combination** of subsequences from the two arrays to get the overall maximum number.

# Approach

1. **Generate Subsequences**:
   - We need a helper function to generate the maximum subsequence of a specific length from an array while maintaining the order. This can be done using a stack to ensure that we get the largest possible digits in the required order.

2. **Merge Subsequences**:
   - Once we have the subsequences from both arrays, we need to merge them. The merging process involves picking the larger digit from the front of each subsequence to form the maximum number.

3. **Combine and Compare**:
   - For each possible split of the total length `k` between the two arrays, generate the subsequences and merge them. Compare the merged result to get the overall maximum number.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(k(n1+n2))***
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)***
# Code
```typescript
function maxNumber(nums1: number[], nums2: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const getMaxSubsequence = (nums: number[], length: number): number[] => {
        const stack = [];
        let drop = nums.length - length;
        for (let num of nums) {
            while (drop > 0 && stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] < num) {
                stack.pop();
                drop--;
            }
            stack.push(num);
        }
        return stack.slice(0, length);
    };
    
    const merge = (nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number[] => {
        const merged = [];
        while (nums1.length + nums2.length) {
            if (nums1 > nums2) {
                merged.push(nums1.shift()!);
            } else {
                merged.push(nums2.shift()!);
            }
        }
        return merged;
    };
    
    let max = [];
    for (let i = Math.max(0, k - nums2.length); i <= Math.min(k, nums1.length); i++) {
        const subsequence1 = getMaxSubsequence(nums1, i);
        const subsequence2 = getMaxSubsequence(nums2, k - i);
        const candidate = merge(subsequence1, subsequence2);
        if (candidate > max) {
            max = candidate;
        }
    }
    
    return max;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **getMaxSubsequence**:
   - This function uses a stack to keep track of the maximum possible subsequence of the given length from an array. It ensures that the remaining elements can still form a sequence of the required length.

2. **merge**:
   - This function merges two subsequences to form the maximum number by comparing the elements in the subsequences and picking the larger element first.

3. **maxNumber**:
   - This function iterates through all possible splits of length `k` between the two arrays, generates the subsequences, merges them, and keeps track of the maximum number formed.
