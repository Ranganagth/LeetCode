[237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

### Problem

You are given **only a reference to a node** (not the head) in a **singly linked list** and must delete it.
You are **guaranteed** that:

* The node is **not the last** node.
* All values are **unique**.
* The given node exists in the list.

# Intuition

Since we **do not have access to the previous node** or the head of the list, we cannot “unlink” the node in a standard way by making `prev.next = node.next`.

Instead, we simulate the deletion by:
* **Copying** the value of the **next node** into the current node.
* **Linking** the current node to `node.next.next`, skipping the next node.

This effectively removes the **next node** and **overwrites** the current one with its value.

# Approach

1. Copy the value of `node.next` into `node`.
2. Set `node.next = node.next.next` to skip over the next node.

This trick works because:
* You're guaranteed the node is **not the last**, so `node.next` is always valid.


# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(1)` — only constant operations.
* **Space**: `O(1)` — no extra memory used.

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.next = next ?? null;
    }
}

function deleteNode(node: ListNode): void {
    if (node.next !== null) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

**Input**:
List: `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9`
Node to delete: node with value `5`

**Steps**:

* Copy value `1` from `node.next` into node (now node becomes `1`)
* Set `node.next` to `node.next.next`, which is `9`

**Result**: `4 -> 1 -> 9`

---

#### Example 2:

**Input**:
List: `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 9`
Node to delete: node with value `1`

**Steps**:

* Copy value `9` into node (node becomes `9`)
* Skip next node (`null`)

**Result**: `4 -> 5 -> 9`

### Summary

This problem uses a neat trick to work around not having access to the head or previous node. By overwriting the current node with its next, we effectively simulate deletion in constant time.
