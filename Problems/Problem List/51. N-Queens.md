[51. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

# Intuition
The N-Queens problem is a classic backtracking problem where we need to place queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Queens attack each other if they share the same row, column, or diagonal.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking Approach**: We can solve the N-Queens problem efficiently using backtracking.
   - Use a 2D array `board` to represent the chessboard where `board[i][j] = 'Q'` if a queen is placed at position `(i, j)`, otherwise `board[i][j] = '.'`.
   - Use arrays `cols`, `diag1`, and `diag2` to keep track of columns and diagonals that are under attack by previously placed queens.
     - `cols[j]` keeps track of whether column `j` has a queen.
     - `diag1[k]` keeps track of whether the diagonal `(i-j)` has a queen. Diagonals of this type have the same difference `(i-j)` for their indices.
     - `diag2[k]` keeps track of whether the diagonal `(i+j)` has a queen. Diagonals of this type have the same sum `(i+j)` for their indices.
   - Start placing queens row by row. For each row `i`, try placing a queen in each column `j`.
   - Before placing a queen, check if the column `j` and diagonals `(i-j)` and `(i+j)` are under attack. If not, place the queen and mark the column and diagonals as under attack.
   - Recursively try to place queens in the subsequent rows.
   - If all rows are filled with queens, add the current configuration of the board to the result.
   - Backtrack by removing the queen and marking the column and diagonals as no longer under attack.

2. **Initialization and Result Collection**: 
   - Initialize the board and arrays to track columns and diagonals.
   - Start placing queens on the chessboard starting from the first row.
   - Collect all valid configurations of the board.

3. **Return**: 
   - Once all configurations are collected, return the list of configurations.

# Explanation
The backtracking approach efficiently explores all possibilities of placing queens on the chessboard. It uses arrays to keep track of columns and diagonals to ensure that no two queens are attacking each other. The solution is implemented to handle the constraints efficiently and collect all valid configurations of the board.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n!)*** - Each queen placement is tried in each row, and there are `n` rows.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(n)*** - Space is used for the board and auxiliary arrays to track columns and diagonals.

# Code
```typescript
function solveNQueens(n: number): string[][] {
    const result: string[][] = [];
    const board: string[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill('.'));
    const cols: boolean[] = Array(n).fill(false);
    const diag1: boolean[] = Array(2 * n - 1).fill(false);
    const diag2: boolean[] = Array(2 * n - 1).fill(false);

    function backtrack(row: number): void {
        if (row === n) {
            const solution: string[] = board.map(row => row.join(''));
            result.push(solution);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (!cols[col] && !diag1[row - col + n - 1] && !diag2[row + col]) {
                board[row][col] = 'Q';
                cols[col] = true;
                diag1[row - col + n - 1] = true;
                diag2[row + col] = true;
                
                backtrack(row + 1);
                
                board[row][col] = '.';
                cols[col] = false;
                diag1[row - col + n - 1] = false;
                diag2[row + col] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(0);
    return result;
};

```
