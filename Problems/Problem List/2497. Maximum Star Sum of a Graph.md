[2497. Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-star-sum-of-a-graph/)

# Intuition

To find the maximum star sum of a star graph with at most *k* edges, we need to determine the star graph that maximizes the sum of the values of the nodes it contains. Each star graph is centered at a node, and the sum includes the center node and up to *k* of its neighbors.

# Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This will help in efficiently accessing the neighbors of each node.
   
2. **Neighbor Value Sorting**:
   - For each node, sort its neighbors based on their values in descending order. This helps in selecting the top *k* neighbors to maximize the star sum.
   
3. **Calculate Star Sums**:
   - For each node, calculate the potential star sum by including the node's value and the values of its top *k* neighbors.
   - Track the maximum star sum encountered during this process.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + e + n log d)***
  - Constructing the adjacency list takes *O(e)*, where *e* is the number of edges.
  - Sorting the neighbors for each node takes *O(d log d)*, where *d* is the degree of the node. Across all nodes, this totals *O(n log d)* in the worst case.
  
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n + e)***
  - Storing the adjacency list requires *O(n + e)*.

# Code

```typescript
function maxStarSum(vals: number[], edges: number[][], k: number): number {
    const n = vals.length;
    
    const adj: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adj[u].push(v);
        adj[v].push(u);
    }
    
    let maxSum = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const sortedNeighbors = adj[i].map(neigh => vals[neigh]).sort((a, b) => b - a);
        
        let currentSum = vals[i];
        for (let j = 0; j < Math.min(k, sortedNeighbors.length); j++) {
            if (sortedNeighbors[j] > 0) {
                currentSum += sortedNeighbors[j];
            }
        }
        
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    
    return maxSum;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Adjacency List Construction**:
   - We construct an adjacency list to efficiently manage the graph and its connections.
   
2. **Neighbor Sorting**:
   - For each node, the neighbors are sorted by their values in descending order to prioritize the neighbors that contribute the most to the star sum.
   
3. **Star Sum Calculation**:
   - For each node, we compute the star sum by adding the node's value and the values of its top *k* neighbors.
   - We keep track of the maximum star sum found during the traversal of all nodes.
