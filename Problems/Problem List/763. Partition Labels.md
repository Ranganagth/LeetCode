[763. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/)

# Intuition
1. **Track Last Occurrence**: First, determine the last occurrence of each character in the string.
2. **Identify Partitions**: Iterate through the string and keep track of the furthest last occurrence of the characters encountered so far. Once you reach this furthest point, you know you can partition the string here.

# Approach
1. **Step 1: Calculate Last Occurrences**
   - Create a map to store the last occurrence of each character in the string.
2. **Step 2: Iterate and Partition**
   - Use two pointers: one for tracking the start of the current partition and another for the end. Update the end pointer to the furthest last occurrence of characters in the current partition.
   - When the current index matches the end pointer, you know you can close this partition and start a new one.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice (once to create the last occurrence map and once to determine the partitions).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since the map will have at most 26 entries (one for each letter of the English alphabet).

# Code
```typescript
function partitionLabels(s: string): number[] {
    const lastOccurrence = new Map<string, number>();
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        lastOccurrence.set(s[i], i);
    }

    const result: number[] = [];
    let start = 0;
    let end = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        end = Math.max(end, lastOccurrence.get(s[i])!);
        if (i === end) {
            result.push(end - start + 1);
            start = i + 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Step 1: Calculate Last Occurrence**
   - We use a `Map` to store the last index where each character appears.
2. **Step 2: Determine Partitions**
   - We initialize `start` and `end` pointers to track the beginning and end of the current partition.
   - As we iterate through the string, we update the `end` pointer to be the maximum of its current value and the last occurrence of the current character.
   - When the current index `i` matches the `end` pointer, it means we have reached the end of a partition. We then calculate the size of this partition, add it to the result list, and update `start` to `i + 1` to start a new partition.
