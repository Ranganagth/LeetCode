[168. Excel Sheet Column Title](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-title/)

# Intuition

To convert an integer `columnNumber` into its corresponding Excel column title, we need to treat it similarly to converting numbers from decimal to a base-26 numeral system (where 'A' represents 1, 'B' represents 2, ..., 'Z' represents 26, and 'AA' represents 27, etc.).

# Approach

1. **Conversion Process**:
   - Initialize an empty string to store the result.
   - Continuously divide the `columnNumber` by 26.
   - For each division, determine the remainder (which corresponds to the rightmost character in Excel column titles).
   - Adjust the remainder (if necessary) to account for 1-based indexing (where 'A' = 1, 'B' = 2, ..., 'Z' = 26).
   - Append the corresponding character to the result string.
   - Update `columnNumber` to reflect the division.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `columnNumber` is 1, return "A".
   - If `columnNumber` is 26, return "Z".
   - For larger numbers, continue dividing and adjusting the remainder until `columnNumber` becomes 0.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: ***O(log(columnNumber))***, because we perform a logarithmic number of divisions.
   - **Space Complexity**: ***O(log(columnNumber))***, to store the result string.

# Code

```typescript
function convertToTitle(columnNumber: number): string {
    let result = '';
    
    while (columnNumber > 0) {
        columnNumber--;
        
        const remainder = columnNumber % 26;
        const char = String.fromCharCode(remainder + 65);
        
        result = char + result;
        columnNumber = Math.floor(columnNumber / 26);
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Start with an empty `result` string.
   
2. **Main Loop**:
   - While `columnNumber` is greater than 0:
     - Adjust `columnNumber` by decrementing by 1 (to convert to 0-based indexing).
     - Calculate `remainder` as `columnNumber % 26`, which gives us the index of the character.
     - Convert `remainder` to its corresponding character using `String.fromCharCode(remainder + 65)`, where 65 is the ASCII value for 'A'.
     - Prepend the character to `result`.
     - Update `columnNumber` by dividing by 26 and taking the floor value.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - After the loop completes, `result` will contain the Excel column title corresponding to the original `columnNumber`.
