[236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

### Problem

Given the root of a **binary tree** (not necessarily a BST), and two distinct nodes `p` and `q`, return their **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**.
The LCA is the **lowest node** in the tree that has **both `p` and `q` as descendants** (a node is allowed to be a descendant of itself).

# Intuition

In a general binary tree:
* We can't rely on ordering like in a BST.
* So, we must **traverse the entire tree** to find where `p` and `q` reside.

The key idea is:
* If one node (`p` or `q`) is found in the **left subtree** and the other in the **right subtree**, the current node is their **LCA**.
* If both nodes are found in **one subtree**, we return the LCA from that subtree.
* If the current node itself is `p` or `q`, we return the current node.

---

# Approach

1. **Use postorder traversal** (left, right, root) recursively.
2. For each node:
   * If it’s `null`, return `null`.
   * If it's `p` or `q`, return that node.
   * Recurse into the left and right subtrees.
   * If both left and right return non-null, current node is the LCA.
   * Else, return the non-null one from either side.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes — we may visit all nodes.
* **Space**: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree — due to recursion stack.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.left = left ?? null;
        this.right = right ?? null;
    }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(
    root: TreeNode | null,
    p: TreeNode,
    q: TreeNode
): TreeNode | null {
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }

    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    if (left !== null && right !== null) {
        return root; // p and q found in different subtrees
    }

    return left !== null ? left : right;
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

**Input**:
Tree: `[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]`
`p = 5`, `q = 1`

**Steps**:

* Traverse down from root 3.
* p (5) is in the left subtree.
* q (1) is in the right subtree.
* So, return 3.

**Output**: `3`

---

#### Example 2:

`p = 5`, `q = 4`

* 5 is in the left subtree.
* 4 is in 5's subtree (as a descendant).
* So, 5 is the lowest common ancestor.

**Output**: `5`

---

### Summary

This recursive method is an optimal and clean solution for finding the LCA in a **general binary tree**, with a guaranteed time complexity of O(n) and only stack space used.
