[377. Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/)

# Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to get the sum `i` using the given numbers.
2. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to get the sum 0, which is to use no elements.
3. **Update the DP Array**: For each number from 1 to the target, iterate through the nums array to update the number of ways to form the current number.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the `dp` array with zeros and set `dp[0]` to 1.
2. **Fill the DP Array**: For each number from 1 to the target:
   - Iterate through the nums array.
   - If the current number is greater than or equal to the current element in nums, add the number of ways to form the current number minus the current element to the number of ways to form the current number.
3. **Result**: The value `dp[target]` will give the number of combinations to achieve the target sum.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n Ã— m)***, where *n* is the target and *m* is the number of elements in nums. This is because for each target sum from 1 to the target, we iterate through all elements in nums.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array storing results up to the target.

# Code
```typescript
function combinationSum4(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= target; i++) {
        for (const num of nums) {
            if (i - num >= 0) {
                dp[i] += dp[i - num];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[target];
};

```

### Follow-up: Negative Numbers

If negative numbers are allowed in the given array, the problem changes significantly. With negative numbers, we could potentially form an infinite number of combinations for some targets. For instance, with a number `-1` and `1`, we could infinitely add and subtract these to form many combinations summing to a particular target.

**Limitations**:
- To handle negative numbers, we must impose a limit on the number of elements used or use memoization with visited states to prevent infinite loops.
- One possible limitation is to bound the number of times any number can be used in the combination.

### Handling Negative Numbers Example:

To handle negative numbers, we could use memoization with bounds on the number of elements used.

```typescript
function combinationSum4WithNegative(nums: number[], target: number, maxElements: number): number {
    const memo = new Map<string, number>();

    function dp(currentTarget: number, elementsUsed: number): number {
        const key = `${currentTarget},${elementsUsed}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) {
            return memo.get(key)!;
        }

        if (currentTarget == 0) return 1;
        if (elementsUsed > maxElements) return 0;

        let result = 0;
        for (const num of nums) {
            result += dp(currentTarget - num, elementsUsed + 1);
        }

        memo.set(key, result);
        return result;
    }

    return dp(target, 0);
};

```
