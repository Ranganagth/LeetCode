[560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

# Intuition

1. **Cumulative Sum**: We use a cumulative sum to keep track of the sum of elements from the beginning of the array up to the current index.
2. **Hash Map**: We use a hash map to store the cumulative sum and the number of times this sum has occurred so far. This helps in determining if there exists a subarray ending at the current index with a sum equal to `k`.

# Approach

1. Initialize a hash map (`prefixSumCount`) to store the cumulative sums and their frequencies.
2. Initialize `currentSum` to 0 and `count` to 0. `currentSum` will keep track of the cumulative sum up to the current index.
3. Traverse the array. For each element, update `currentSum`.
4. Check if `currentSum - k` exists in the hash map. If it does, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index whose sum is `k`.
5. Increment the `count` by the number of times `currentSum - k` has occurred.
6. Update the hash map with the current cumulative sum.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, in the worst case, the hash map could store all unique cumulative sums.

# Code
```typescript
function subarraySum(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const prefixSumCount: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    prefixSumCount.set(0, 1);

    let currentSum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        currentSum += nums[i];

        if (prefixSumCount.has(currentSum - k)) {
            count += prefixSumCount.get(currentSum - k)!;
        }

        prefixSumCount.set(currentSum, (prefixSumCount.get(currentSum) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return count;
};

```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start by initializing the `prefixSumCount` map with a base case of `{0: 1}` to account for subarrays starting from the beginning.
- **Cumulative Sum Update**: For each element in the array, update the `currentSum`.
- **Check for Subarray**: If `currentSum - k` exists in the map, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index with sum `k`.
- **Update Count**: Increment the count by the number of times `currentSum - k` has occurred.
- **Update Hash Map**: Update the hash map with the current cumulative sum.
