[931. Minimum Falling Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum/)

# Intuition

For each element in the matrix, the minimum path sum to that element can be calculated by considering the minimum path sum of the elements directly above it in the previous row, as well as the elements to the left and right diagonally above it.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We can use the input matrix itself to store the minimum path sums to avoid extra space.
2. **Transition**:
   - For each element in row *i*, the minimum path sum to that element is the value of the element itself plus the minimum of the path sums to the three possible elements above it from row *i-1* (if they exist).
3. **Result**: The result is the minimum value in the last row of the matrix after processing all rows.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)*** since we process each element of the matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we are modifying the input matrix in place and not using any additional space.

# Code
```typescript
function minFallingPathSum(matrix: number[][]): number {
    const n = matrix.length;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            let minAbove = matrix[i-1][j];
            
            if (j > 0) {
                minAbove = Math.min(minAbove, matrix[i-1][j-1]);
            }
            
            if (j < n - 1) {
                minAbove = Math.min(minAbove, matrix[i-1][j+1]);
            }
            
            matrix[i][j] += minAbove;
        }
    }
    
    return Math.min(...matrix[n-1]);
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The first row remains unchanged since the path starts from any element in the first row.
2. **DP Transition**: For each element in row *i*, update its value by adding the minimum of the values directly above, diagonally left above, and diagonally right above from the previous row.
3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all rows, the minimum value in the last row gives the minimum falling path sum.
