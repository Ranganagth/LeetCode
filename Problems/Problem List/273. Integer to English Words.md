[273. Integer to English Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/)

### Problem: Convert Integer to English Words

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return its English words representation.

---

# Intuition

This problem is best approached by **breaking the number into chunks of 3 digits**, because English representation works in groupings of thousands:
* Billion, Million, Thousand, Hundred, etc.

We use recursion or helper functions to handle:
* Numbers under 20
* Tens (20, 30, ..., 90)
* Hundreds
* Thousands and above

---

# Approach

1. **Divide the number** into groups of three digits starting from the right.
2. **Translate each 3-digit group** using helper functions.
3. Add the appropriate **scale suffix** (e.g., Thousand, Million).
4. Concatenate the words and trim extra spaces.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` — Because the number of digits in the input is at most 10 (up to 2³¹−1).
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — Only constant space used for string building (not counting output).

# Code

```ts
function numberToWords(num: number): string {
    if (num === 0) return "Zero";

    const belowTwenty = [
        "", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven",
        "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen",
        "Fourteen", "Fifteen", "Sixteen", "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"
    ];

    const tens = [
        "", "", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty",
        "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"
    ];

    const thousands = ["", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"];

    function helper(n: number): string {
        if (n === 0) return "";
        else if (n < 20) return belowTwenty[n] + " ";
        else if (n < 100) {
            return tens[Math.floor(n / 10)] + " " + helper(n % 10);
        } else {
            return belowTwenty[Math.floor(n / 100)] + " Hundred " + helper(n % 100);
        }
    }

    let res = "";
    let i = 0;

    while (num > 0) {
        const chunk = num % 1000;
        if (chunk !== 0) {
            res = helper(chunk) + thousands[i] + " " + res;
        }
        num = Math.floor(num / 1000);
        i++;
    }

    return res.trim();
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Input**: `1234567`

* Break into: 1 → "Million", 234 → "Thousand", 567 → ""
* Convert:

  * 1 → "One Million"
  * 234 → "Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand"
  * 567 → "Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
* Combine: `"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"`

**Output**: `"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"`

---

# Summary

This solution uses:

* Number-to-word mapping
* Chunk processing (by 3 digits)
* Recursion to simplify each segment
  It efficiently converts any non-negative integer ≤ 2³¹−1 to its English representation.
