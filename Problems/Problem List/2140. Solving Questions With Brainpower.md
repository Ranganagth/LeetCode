[2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/)

# Intuition

The problem can be visualized as a series of decisions where, for each question, we need to determine whether to solve it and skip a few subsequent questions, or to skip it and move to the next question. This is a classic problem of dynamic programming where each decision depends on the results of future decisions.

#### Key Points to Consider

1. **Dynamic Decision Making**:
    
    - At each question, you have two choices:
        1. **Solve the current question**: This means you earn the points associated with the current question, but you have to skip the next `brainpower[i]` questions.
        2. **Skip the current question**: This means you do not earn the points for the current question but are free to consider the next question immediately.
2. **Recursive Nature**:
    
    - The maximum points that can be earned from the current question is the maximum of the points earned by solving the current question plus the points from the next valid question, or the points earned by skipping the current question.
3. **Building the Solution Bottom-Up**:
    
    - We use a bottom-up approach to fill in the dynamic programming (DP) array. This means starting from the last question and working our way to the first question.
    - By doing this, we ensure that when we make a decision at any question `i`, we have already computed the optimal decisions for all subsequent questions.

# Approach

1. **Define DP Array**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum points that can be earned starting from question `i`.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If we solve the current question `i`, the next question we can consider solving is `i + brainpower[i] + 1`.
   - If we skip the current question, the next question we consider is `i + 1`.
   - Thus, the recurrence relation is:
     \[
     dp[i] = \max(\text{points}[i] + dp[i + \text{brainpower}[i] + 1], dp[i + 1])
     \]
   - Where `dp[i + \text{brainpower}[i] + 1]` represents the points we can earn if we solve the current question and then jump to the next possible question, and `dp[i + 1]` represents the points we can earn if we skip the current question.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If we are beyond the last question, `dp[n] = 0` where `n` is the length of the questions array.

4. **Fill DP Array from Right to Left**:
   - Start filling the `dp` array from the end to the beginning using the above relation.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the length of the questions array. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** due to the `dp` array used to store the maximum points for each question.

# Code
```typescript
function mostPoints(questions: number[][]): number {
    const n = questions.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const points = questions[i][0];
        const brainpower = questions[i][1];
        const nextIndex = i + brainpower + 1;

        const solveCurrent = points + (nextIndex < n ? dp[nextIndex] : 0);
        const skipCurrent = dp[i + 1];

        dp[i] = Math.max(solveCurrent, skipCurrent);
    }

    return dp[0];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the length of the questions array.
   - `dp` is initialized to an array of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0.

2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - We iterate from the last question to the first question.
   - For each question, we calculate the points if we solve it and jump to the next possible question (`solveCurrent`).
   - We also calculate the points if we skip the current question (`skipCurrent`).
   - We then take the maximum of these two values to fill `dp[i]`.

3. **Result**:
   - The maximum points that can be earned starting from the first question is stored in `dp[0]`.
