[852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/)

# Intuition

1. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - Compare the middle element with its next element:
     - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, then the peak must be to the right of `mid` (including `mid + 1`).
     - If `arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]`, then the peak must be to the left of `mid` (including `mid`).
   - Adjust the pointers `left` and `right` based on the comparison.
   - Continue the process until `left` equals `right`, which will point to the peak element.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Set `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index of the array.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - Adjust the pointers based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `arr[mid + 1]`.
3. **Return the Peak**:
   - When `left` equals `right`, the peak element's index is found.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)*** because the binary search reduces the search space by half each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function peakIndexInMountainArray(arr: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return left;
};

```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `left` starts at 0.
  - `right` starts at `arr.length - 1`.
- **Binary Search Loop**:
  - Calculate `mid` using integer division.
  - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, move `left` to `mid + 1` (peak is on the right).
  - Otherwise, move `right` to `mid` (peak is on the left).
- **Termination**:
  - The loop terminates when `left` equals `right`, which is the index of the peak element.
