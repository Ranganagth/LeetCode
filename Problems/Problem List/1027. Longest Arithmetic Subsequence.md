[1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence/)

# Intuition

For each pair of elements in the array, calculate the difference and maintain a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(i, d)`, representing the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index `i` with a common difference `d`.

# Approach

1. Initialize a dictionary `dp` where `dp[(i, d)]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at index `i` with a common difference `d`.
2. Iterate over each pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `i < j`:
   - Compute the difference `d = nums[j] - nums[i]`.
   - If `dp[(i, d)]` is already defined, then `dp[(j, d)] = dp[(i, d)] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[(j, d)] = 2` because a pair itself is the smallest arithmetic subsequence.
3. Track the maximum length found during the iterations.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n²)***, where `n` is the length of the array, because we iterate over each pair of indices.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)***, for storing the dictionary entries.

# Code
```typescript
function longestArithSeqLength(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;
    const dp: Map<string, number> = new Map();
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            const d = nums[j] - nums[i];
            const key = `${i},${d}`;
            const nextKey = `${j},${d}`;
            const currLength = (dp.get(key) || 1) + 1;
            dp.set(nextKey, currLength);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currLength);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a dictionary `dp` to store the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference.
2. **Iterate Over Pairs**: We iterate over each pair of indices `(i, j)`:
   - Calculate the difference `d` between `nums[j]` and `nums[i]`.
   - Use the dictionary `dp` to determine the length of the arithmetic subsequence ending at `i` with difference `d` and update the length for the subsequence ending at `j` with the same difference.
   - Update `maxLength` to keep track of the longest subsequence length found.
3. **Return Result**: The maximum value in `dp` gives the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in the array.
