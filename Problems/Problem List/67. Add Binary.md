[67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/)

# Intuition

1. **Binary Addition Rules**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 0 + 1 = 1
   - 1 + 0 = 1
   - 1 + 1 = 10 (which is 0 with a carry of 1)

2. **Handling Different Lengths**:
   - If the lengths of the two strings are different, we can pad the shorter string with leading zeros to make them the same length.

3. **Carry Management**:
   - Maintain a `carry` variable that stores the carry from the previous addition of bits.

# Approach

1. Initialize indices for the two strings starting from the end.
2. Loop through the strings from the end to the beginning.
3. Add the corresponding bits along with the carry.
4. Store the result (bit) in the result string and update the carry.
5. If there's a carry left after finishing the loop, prepend it to the result.
6. Return the resulting binary string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(max(m, n))*** where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(max(m, n))*** for storing the result.

# Code
```typescript
function addBinary(a: string, b: string): string {
    let i = a.length - 1;
    let j = b.length - 1;
    let carry = 0;
    let result = '';

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
        let sum = carry;
        
        if (i >= 0) {
            sum += a[i] === '1' ? 1 : 0;
            i--;
        }
        
        if (j >= 0) {
            sum += b[j] === '1' ? 1 : 0;
            j--;
        }
        
        result = (sum % 2).toString() + result;
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` and `j` are set to the last indices of `a` and `b` respectively.
   - `carry` is initialized to 0.
   - `result` is initialized to an empty string.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop continues until all bits from both strings have been processed and there is no carry left.
   - `sum` is calculated by adding the current bits of `a` and `b` and the carry.
   - The result bit (`sum % 2`) is prepended to `result`.
   - The carry is updated to `Math.floor(sum / 2)`.

3. **Return**:
   - The final binary sum stored in `result` is returned.
