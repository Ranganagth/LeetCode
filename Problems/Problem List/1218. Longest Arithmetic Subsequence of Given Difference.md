[1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence-of-given-difference/)

# Intuition

The main idea is to maintain a dictionary where the key is an element in the array and the value is the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with that element. For each element in the array, we check if there exists a previous element in the sequence such that the difference between the current element and the previous element is equal to the given difference. If such an element exists, we update the length of the sequence for the current element.

# Approach

1. Initialize an empty dictionary `dp` to store the lengths of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at each element.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - For each element `arr[i]`, check if `arr[i] - difference` exists in `dp`.
   - If it exists, update `dp[arr[i]]` to `dp[arr[i] - difference] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[arr[i]]` to 1.
3. The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` dictionary.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the array. We only iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, as we use a dictionary to store the lengths of subsequences for each element in the array.

# Code
```typescript
function longestSubsequence(arr: number[], difference: number): number {
    const dp: { [key: number]: number } = {};
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (const num of arr) {
        const prevNum = num - difference;
        if (prevNum in dp) {
            dp[num] = dp[prevNum] + 1;
        } else {
            dp[num] = 1;
        }
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[num]);
    }

    return maxLength;
};

```

### Explanation

1. We use a dictionary `dp` where `dp[num]` represents the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending with the number `num`.
2. For each number `num` in the array:
   - We compute the previous number `prevNum` in the potential subsequence by subtracting the `difference` from `num`.
   - If `prevNum` exists in the dictionary, it means we can extend the subsequence ending with `prevNum` to include `num`, so we set `dp[num] = dp[prevNum] + 1`.
   - If `prevNum` does not exist in the dictionary, it means `num` starts a new subsequence, so we set `dp[num] = 1`.
3. We keep track of the maximum length of any subsequence found during the iteration.
