[334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)

### Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to determine if there exists a **strictly increasing triplet subsequence**, i.e., **three indices** `i < j < k` such that:

```
nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]
```

# Intuition

The idea is to track the **smallest** and **second smallest** elements we've seen so far while traversing the array.

* If we ever find a number that is **larger than both**, then we have a triplet.
* This works because we only care about **existence**, not actual indices or values.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize two variables:
   * `first` = ∞ (smallest so far)
   * `second` = ∞ (second smallest so far)

2. Traverse through the array:
   * If `num <= first`, update `first = num`
   * Else if `num <= second`, update `second = num`
   * Else, return `true` because `num > second > first`

3. If the loop ends and no triplet is found, return `false`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** `O(n)` – One pass through the array
* **Space:** `O(1)` – Only constant variables used

---

# Code

```ts
function increasingTriplet(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let first = Infinity;
    let second = Infinity;

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (num <= first) {
            first = num; // smallest so far
        } else if (num <= second) {
            second = num; // second smallest
        } else {
            // Found a third number larger than both
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1:**

```ts
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first = 1, second = 2 → found 3 > second → return true
```

#### **Example 2:**

```ts
nums = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
first keeps getting updated, but we never find a second or third → return false
```

#### **Example 3:**

```ts
nums = [2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6]
first = 1, second = 4 → 6 > 4 → return true
```

---

### **Summary**

* Efficient O(n) time, O(1) space solution.
* Leverages greedy approach: find first and second smallest increasing values.
* Returns true as soon as a valid increasing triplet is found.
