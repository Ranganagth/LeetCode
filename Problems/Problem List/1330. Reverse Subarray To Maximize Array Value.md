[1330. Reverse Subarray To Maximize Array Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-subarray-to-maximize-array-value/)

# Intuition:

We are given an integer array `nums` and a rule for calculating its **value**:

- The value is defined as the sum of absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in the array.

We can select any **subarray** and reverse it **only once**. The goal is to find the **maximum possible value** of the array after performing this reversal.

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Value Calculation**: We calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements of the array.
2. **Effect of Reversing a Subarray**: Reversing a subarray can affect the value in two ways:
    - If the difference between the starting and ending elements of the subarray is significant, reversing it can increase or decrease the total value.
    - Specifically, reversing a subarray at the boundaries (e.g., near the start or end of the array) can have the largest effect.

# Approach:

- **Initial Value**: Compute the value of the array as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Boundary Adjustments**: Look for subarrays at the boundaries (start and end) that could maximize the absolute differences.
- **Middle Subarray Reversals**: For subarrays in the middle of the array, track the maximum possible gain by reversing subarrays that maximize the difference between adjacent elements.


# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in linear time, ***O(n)***, since we iterate over the array multiple times (once for the base value and again for the maximum gain calculation).
    
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(1)***, as we are using only a few extra variables to store the intermediate values and gains.

# Code:

```typescript
function maxValueAfterReverse(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;

    let baseValue = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        baseValue += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]);
    }

    let maxGain = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxGain = Math.max(maxGain, Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[i]) - Math.abs(nums[i - 1] - nums[i]));
        maxGain = Math.max(maxGain, Math.abs(nums[n - 1] - nums[i - 1]) - Math.abs(nums[i - 1] - nums[i]));
    }

    let minEdge = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let maxEdge = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxEdge = Math.max(maxEdge, Math.min(nums[i], nums[i - 1]));
        minEdge = Math.min(minEdge, Math.max(nums[i], nums[i - 1]));
    }

    maxGain = Math.max(maxGain, (maxEdge - minEdge) * 2);

    return baseValue + maxGain;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Calculation**:
    
    - We compute the initial value of the array by calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Maximizing the Gain**:
    
    - For each subarray, we calculate the maximum possible change that can be achieved by reversing a subarray that starts near the beginning or ends near the end. These cases give the largest potential change in the value.
    - Additionally, we also track subarrays in the middle of the array and check how reversing them can potentially increase the total value.
3. **Final Output**:
    
    - We return the initial value plus the maximum gain achieved through the best possible subarray reversal.

### Example Walkthrough:
#### Example:

**Input**: `nums = [93997, 2877, -93018, -76995, -70679]`

1. **Initial Calculation**:
    - `|93997 - 2877| + |2877 - (-93018)| + |-93018 - (-76995)| + |-76995 - (-70679)|`
    - This results in `91120 + 95895 + 16023 + 6316 = 209354`.
2. **Maximizing the Gain**:
    
    - We check for possible gains by reversing subarrays near the start or end:
        - Reversing subarrays like `[2877, -93018]`, or `[93997, -93018]` could provide significant increases.
        - The exact combination that yields the maximum value needs to be explored.
    
    After considering all possible reversals, the maximum gain that can be achieved is `369098`.
