[142. Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

# Intuition

To detect the start of a cycle in a linked list, we can use Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (tortoise and hare). This algorithm not only detects the presence of a cycle but also helps in identifying the starting node of the cycle. Once a cycle is detected, we can use the properties of the algorithm to find the entry point of the cycle.

# Approach

1. **Detect Cycle**: Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, and the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet.
2. **Find Entry Point of Cycle**:
   - Once the cycle is detected (i.e., when `slow` and `fast` meet), reset one of the pointers (e.g., `slow`) to the head of the list.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the start of the cycle.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Both pointers traverse the list linearly.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as no extra space is used other than a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
 *     }
 * }
 */

function detectCycle(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) return null;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;

        if (slow === fast) {
            slow = head;
            while (slow !== fast) {
                slow = slow!.next;
                fast = fast!.next;
            }
            return slow;
        }
    }

    return null;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check**: If the list is empty or has only one node, it cannot have a cycle, so return `null`.
2. **Cycle Detection**: Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to detect if there is a cycle.
3. **Finding the Entry Point**:
   - Once a cycle is detected, reset the `slow` pointer to the head.
   - Move both `slow` and `fast` pointers one step at a time until they meet. The node where they meet is the start of the cycle.
4. **Return Result**: The function returns the node where the cycle begins, or `null` if there is no cycle.
