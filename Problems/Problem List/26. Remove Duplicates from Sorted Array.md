[26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

# Intuition
Given that the input array `nums` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, we can efficiently remove duplicates in-place while maintaining the relative order of the elements. The problem requires us to return the number of unique elements and modify the array such that only the first `k` elements are unique and sorted.

# Approach
We can use two pointers to achieve this:

1. **Initialization:** Initialize a pointer `j` which will point to the current position where the next unique element should be placed. Start `j` from 1, as the first element is always unique.
  
2. **Iterate through the Array:** Start iterating through the array with a pointer `i` starting from the second element (index 1). Compare each element with the previous element (at index `j-1`):
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is different from `nums[j-1]`, it means we've found a new unique element. So, assign `nums[i]` to `nums[j]` and increment `j`.
   
3. **Result:** At the end of the iteration, `j` will be the length of the new array with unique elements.

4. **Return Value:** Return `j` as the number of unique elements.

# Explanation
- We start with two pointers, `i` and `j`, where `i` traverses through the array and `j` points to the position where the next unique element should go.
- As we iterate through the array, whenever we find a new unique element (i.e., `nums[i] !== nums[j-1]`), we place it at `nums[j]`.
- By the end of the iteration, all unique elements are correctly placed in the first `j` positions of the array `nums`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the array `nums`. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)***. We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let j = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== nums[j - 1]) {
            nums[j++] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    return j;
};
```
