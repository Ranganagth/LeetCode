[47. Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/)


# Intuition
When generating permutations with potential duplicates, the main challenge is to avoid producing duplicate permutations. Sorting the array helps us easily skip over duplicate elements during the permutation process.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the input array to ensure that duplicates are adjacent.
2. **Backtracking Setup**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all permutations.
   - Use a `used` array to keep track of which elements have been included in the current permutation.
   - Use a `path` array to build the current permutation.
3. **Base Case**:
   - If the `path` array reaches the same length as the input array `nums`, add a copy of `path` to the result.
4. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through each element in `nums`.
   - Skip elements that have already been used.
   - Skip duplicate elements in the same recursive level to avoid duplicate permutations.
   - If an element has not been used, mark it as used, add it to `path`, and recursively build the permutation.
   - After exploring that branch of recursion, backtrack by marking the element as unused and removing it from `path`.
5. **Return**:
   - Return the `result` array which contains all unique permutations.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n * n!)***, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This accounts for generating all unique permutations and the work done to handle duplicates.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n * n!)***, due to the storage of all unique permutations and additional space used by the `path` and `used` arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function permuteUnique(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const used: boolean[] = new Array(nums.length).fill(false);
    const path: number[] = [];

    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    function backtrack() {
        if (path.length === nums.length) {
            result.push([...path]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (used[i] || (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1] && !used[i - 1])) {
                continue;
            }
            used[i] = true;
            path.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack();
            path.pop();
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }

    backtrack();
    return result;
};

```
