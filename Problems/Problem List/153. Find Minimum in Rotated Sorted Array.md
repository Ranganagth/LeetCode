[153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

# Intuition

The key observation here is to use binary search because the array is sorted in ascending order with a rotation. Using binary search allows us to quickly discard half of the array in each step, thereby reducing the search space efficiently.

# Approach

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`. `left` starts at the beginning of the array and `right` starts at the end of the array.
   
2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - Compare the element at `mid` with the element at `right`.
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, then the minimum element must be to the left of `mid` (including `mid` itself), because in a sorted rotated array, the smallest element will always be less than the element at `right`.
       - Update `right = mid`.
     - Otherwise, if `nums[mid] >= nums[right]`, then the minimum element must be to the right of `mid`.
       - Update `left = mid + 1`.
   
3. **Termination**:
   - When `left` equals `right`, `left` will be pointing to the minimum element of the array.
   - Return `nums[left]`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***. Binary search reduces the search space by half in each step, so it runs in logarithmic time relative to the size of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. We are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function findMin(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return nums[left];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the beginning and end of the array respectively.
- We perform a binary search:
  - Calculate `mid` as the middle index.
  - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]` to determine which half to discard.
  - Adjust `left` or `right` based on the comparison.
- When the loop terminates (`left >= right`), `left` will be pointing to the minimum element in the array.
- Return `nums[left]`, which is the minimum element.
