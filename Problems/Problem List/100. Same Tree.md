[100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

# Intuition

To determine if two binary trees are the same, we need to check two main conditions recursively:
1. The current nodes of the two trees should have the same value.
2. The left subtree of both trees should be the same.
3. The right subtree of both trees should be the same.

# Approach

- Check if both `p` and `q` are `null`. If they are, return `true` because two `null` trees are considered identical.
- Check if either `p` or `q` is `null` while the other is not. If so, return `false` because they cannot be identical.
- Check if the values of the current nodes `p.val` and `q.val` are different. If they are, return `false`.
- Recursively call the function for the left subtree and right subtree and return the logical AND of the results.

# Complexity
- The **time complexity** of this approach is ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- The **space complexity** is also ***O(n)*** in the worst case due to the recursive stack, where n is the height of the binary tree.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function isSameTree(p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!p && !q) return true;
    if (!p || !q) return false;
    if (p.val !== q.val) return false;
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
};
