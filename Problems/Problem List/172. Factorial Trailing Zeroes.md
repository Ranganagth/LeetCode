[172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/factorial-trailing-zeroes/)

# Intuition
To count the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \):
1. Count how many multiples of 5 are there between 1 and \( n \).
2. Count how many multiples of \( 5^2 \) (i.e., 25) are there between 1 and \( n \).
3. Count how many multiples of \( 5^3 \) (i.e., 125) are there between 1 and \( n \).
4. Continue this process until \( 5^k \) where \( 5^k \leq n \).

The total count of these multiples will give the number of trailing zeroes in \( n! \).

# Approach
1. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
2. Loop with the variable `i` starting from 5 and multiplying `i` by 5 each iteration (i.e., `i = i * 5`).
3. In each iteration, add the integer division of `n` by `i` to `count` (i.e., `count += Math.floor(n / i)`).
4. Stop the loop when `i` exceeds `n`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(log n)*** since we keep dividing `n` by powers of 5.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)*** since we are only using a few variables.

# Code
```typescript
function trailingZeroes(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 5; i <= n; i *= 5) {
        count += Math.floor(n / i);
    }
    return count;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We start with `count = 0`.
2. **Loop**: For each power of 5 (5, 25, 125, etc.), we add the number of multiples of that power of 5 within the range of 1 to `n` to `count`.
3. **Return**: The final value of `count` gives the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.
