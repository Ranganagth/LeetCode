[233. Number of Digit One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-digit-one/)

# Intuition

The main idea is to iterate through each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and count how many times the digit 1 appears in that specific place across all numbers from 0 to *n*.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with a variable `count` to store the total number of occurrences of the digit 1.
   - Use a variable `factor` to represent the current digit place we're evaluating (units, tens, hundreds, etc.).

2. **Loop through each digit place**:
   - For each digit place, determine the parts of the number that are higher, current, and lower relative to the current digit place.
   - Use these parts to calculate how many times the digit 1 appears in the current digit place across all numbers up to *n*.

3. **Counting logic**:
   - **Higher part**: The number of times the digit 1 appears in the current place due to the numbers in the higher part.
   - **Current digit**: If the current digit is 0, it contributes nothing. If it's 1, it contributes based on the lower part. If it's greater than 1, it contributes fully for that place.
   - **Lower part**: Used to add any remaining count when the current digit is 1.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)*** because we process each digit place of *n*.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we only use a few additional variables.

# Code
```typescript
function countDigitOne(n: number): number {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;

    let count = 0;
    let factor = 1;
    let lower = 0;
    let current = 0;
    let higher = 0;

    while (Math.floor(n / factor) !== 0) {
        lower = n - Math.floor(n / factor) * factor;
        current = Math.floor((n / factor) % 10);
        higher = Math.floor(n / (factor * 10));

        if (current === 0) {
            count += higher * factor;
        } else if (current === 1) {
            count += higher * factor + lower + 1;
        } else {
            count += (higher + 1) * factor;
        }

        factor *= 10;
    }

    return count;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the total occurrences of the digit 1.
   - `factor` starts at 1 (units place).

2. **Loop**:
   - For each iteration, `factor` is multiplied by 10 to move to the next digit place (tens, hundreds, etc.).
   - `lower`, `current`, and `higher` are calculated to get the lower part, the current digit, and the higher part relative to the current place.

3. **Counting**:
   - If the current digit is 0, only the higher part contributes to the count.
   - If the current digit is 1, both the higher part and the lower part (plus one more for the current place itself) contribute.
   - If the current digit is greater than 1, the higher part and an additional complete set of 1s for the current place contribute.
