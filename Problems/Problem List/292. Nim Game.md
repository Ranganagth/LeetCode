[292. Nim Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/)

# Intuition

The game is based on a **simple mathematical pattern** when both players play optimally:

* Each player can take **1 to 3 stones**.
* If the total number of stones `n` is a **multiple of 4**, you **cannot win** if the opponent also plays optimally.

**Why?**

* Suppose `n = 4`. No matter what you pick (1, 2, or 3), your opponent can always pick stones to bring the count to 0 on their turn:

  * If you take 1 → opponent takes 3
  * If you take 2 → opponent takes 2
  * If you take 3 → opponent takes 1

* If `n = 5`, you can win by taking 1 (now it's 4 and opponent is in the losing position).

* So on...

Hence, the winning strategy is:

* If `n % 4 === 0`, return `false`.
* Else, return `true`.

# Approach

1. Check if `n` is divisible by 4.
2. Return `false` if it is, otherwise return `true`.

This is **constant time** and requires no loops, recursion, or extra space.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(1)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

# Code

```ts
function canWinNim(n: number): boolean {
    return n % 4 !== 0;
};

```

### **Examples**

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `n = 4`
**Output:** `false`
**Explanation:** No matter what you take (1, 2, or 3), your opponent can always win.

#### Example 2:

**Input:** `n = 1`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** You take 1 and win immediately.

#### Example 3:

**Input:** `n = 2`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** Take both in two moves. You win.

### **Summary**

This problem is a classic example of a **modulo-based pattern** in game theory. Once you realize the pattern (every 4th number is a losing state), the solution becomes immediate and efficient.
