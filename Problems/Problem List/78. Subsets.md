[78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

# Intuition
To generate all possible subsets of a given array `nums`, we can use the backtracking approach. The power set of a set `nums` is the set of all its subsets, including the empty set and the set itself.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking**:
   - Start with an empty subset and explore adding each element of `nums` to the current subset.
   - Recursively explore all subsets that can be formed by adding subsequent elements.
   - Backtrack by removing the last added element to explore other possibilities.

2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Define a recursive function `backtrack` that takes a `start` index and the `currentSubset`.
   - Base Case: When `start` equals `nums.length`, add the `currentSubset` to the `result`.
   - Recursive Case: For each index `i` starting from `start` to `nums.length`, add `nums[i]` to `currentSubset`, recursively call `backtrack` with `i + 1`, and then remove `nums[i]` from `currentSubset`.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - Collect all subsets in the `result` array.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the `result` array containing all subsets of `nums`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)***, where *n* is the length of `nums`. This is because there are *2ⁿ* subsets, and for each subset, we copy it into the `result`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)*** to store all subsets.

# Code
```typescript
function subsets(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];

    const backtrack = (start: number, currentSubset: number[]) => {
        result.push([...currentSubset]);

        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentSubset.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, currentSubset);
            currentSubset.pop();
        }
    };

    backtrack(0, []);
    return result;
};

```
