[32. Longest Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-valid-parentheses/)

# Intuition
To find the length of the longest valid parentheses substring, we can use a stack-based approach. The idea is to maintain a stack where we push indices of the '(' characters. For every ')' character encountered, we can pop from the stack and update the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**: 
   - Use a stack to store indices of '(' characters.
   - Initialize a variable `maxLen` to store the maximum length found.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Push the index of '(' characters onto the stack.
   - For ')' characters:
     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack. Calculate the current length by subtracting the index of the top element from the current index.
     - Update `maxLen` if the current length is greater.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is empty or the stack is empty after processing, return `maxLen`.
   - After the first pass, we need to do a second pass in reverse to handle cases where there are unmatched '(' characters.

4. **Reverse Pass**:
   - Reset the stack and `maxLen`.
   - Traverse the string from right to left.
   - Similar logic as above, but now push indices of ')' characters onto the stack and pop '(' characters.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - After both passes, `maxLen` will contain the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the string. We do two passes over the string.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the stack which can store at most n/2 indices.

# Code
```typescript
function longestValidParentheses(s: string): number {
    let maxLen = 0;
    const stack: number[] = [-1];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else { 
            stack.pop();
            if (stack.length === 0) {
                stack.push(i); 
            } else {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - stack[stack.length - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    stack.length = 0;
    stack.push(s.length); 
    
    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === ')') {
            stack.push(i);
        } else { 
            stack.pop();
            if (stack.length === 0) {
                stack.push(i); 
            } else {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, stack[stack.length - 1] - i);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxLen;
};
