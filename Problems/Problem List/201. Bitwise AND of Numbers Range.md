[201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/bitwise-and-of-numbers-range/)

# Intuition

The bitwise AND operation results in 1 only when both bits are 1, otherwise, the result is 0. Given a range `[left, right]`, the result of the AND operation will be influenced by the positions of the bits that differ between `left` and `right`.

# Approach

1. **Bitwise Operation Insight**:
   - The most significant bit (MSB) that differs between `left` and `right` will determine the result of the AND operation.
   - If `left` and `right` have different numbers of bits, the AND of all numbers in between will be 0 because there will be a number with a 0 bit in the position where `left` and `right` differ.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the common prefix of `left` and `right`. This is the highest bit position where `left` and `right` are the same.
   - Construct the result by setting all bits to the right of this common prefix to 0.

# Code
```typescript
function rangeBitwiseAnd(left: number, right: number): number {
    let shift = 0;
    
    while (left < right) {
        left >>= 1;
        right >>= 1;
        shift++;
    }
    
    return left << shift;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Common MSB**:
   - We iterate and right-shift both `left` and `right` until they are equal or `left` becomes greater than `right`.
   - This effectively finds the common prefix (up to the most significant bit) of `left` and `right`.

2. **Constructing the Result**:
   - After finding the common MSB, left-shift `left` by the number of bits we right-shifted to recover the original number and maintain the range `[left, right]`.
   - The left-shift operation effectively clears all bits to the right of the common MSB, resulting in the final answer.
