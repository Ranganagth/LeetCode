[354. Russian Doll Envelopes](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/)

# Intuition and Approach

1. **Sorting**:
   - First, we need to sort the envelopes. The sorting criteria are crucial:
     - Sort primarily by width in ascending order.
     - If two envelopes have the same width, sort them by height in descending order. This ensures that envelopes with the same width cannot be nested within each other, which simplifies the problem to finding a LIS based on height.

2. **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)**:
   - After sorting the envelopes, we only need to focus on the heights to find the longest increasing subsequence. The LIS problem on the heights array will give us the maximum number of envelopes that can be Russian dolled.

### Steps

1. **Sort the envelopes**:
   - Use the criteria: (width ascending, height descending).

2. **Find the LIS on heights**:
   - Use a dynamic programming approach or a binary search approach for finding the LIS efficiently.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the envelopes takes ***O(n log n)***.
  - Finding the LIS using binary search takes ***O(n log n)***.

- **Space Complexity**: both approaches use ***O(n)*** space for storing the LIS.

# Code
```typescript
function maxEnvelopes(envelopes: number[][]): number {
    if (envelopes.length === 0) return 0;

    envelopes.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] === b[0]) {
            return b[1] - a[1];
        }
        return a[0] - b[0];
    });

    const heights = envelopes.map(envelope => envelope[1]);
    return lengthOfLIS(heights);
}

function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
    const lis = [];
    for (const num of nums) {
        let left = 0;
        let right = lis.length;
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (lis[mid] < num) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        if (left < lis.length) {
            lis[left] = num;
        } else {
            lis.push(num);
        }
    }
    return lis.length;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
   - The envelopes are sorted with the custom comparator. Envelopes with the same width will have heights sorted in descending order to prevent nesting of envelopes with the same width.

2. **LIS Calculation**:
   - We extract the heights from the sorted envelopes.
   - We then find the LIS of these heights using a binary search approach, which efficiently finds the position to replace or append the height in the current LIS array.
