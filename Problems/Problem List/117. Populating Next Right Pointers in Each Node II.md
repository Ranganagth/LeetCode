[117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/)

# Intuition:
To connect each node on the same level with the following node (to its right) in a binary tree, we can use a level-order traversal approach. This problem can be efficiently solved using a queue to process nodes level by level.

# Approach:
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue with the root of the tree.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a while loop to process each level of the tree.
   - For each level, determine the number of nodes (`levelSize`) and process all nodes in that level.
   - Keep track of the `previousNode` to set the `next` pointer correctly.
   - For each node:
     - Connect the `next` pointer of the `previousNode` to the current node.
     - Update `previousNode` to the current node.
     - Add the left and right children of the current node to the queue if they exist.
3. **Termination**: After connecting all levels, return the root node of the tree.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** due to the queue, which can contain up to all nodes in the last level of the binary tree in the worst case.

# Code:
```typescript
class Node {
    val: number;
    left: Node | null;
    right: Node | null;
    next: Node | null;

    constructor(val?: number, left?: Node, right?: Node, next?: Node) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
        this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function connect(root: Node | null): Node | null {
    if (root === null) {
        return null;
    }

    const queue: Node[] = [root];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        let previousNode: Node | null = null;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const currentNode = queue.shift()!;

            if (previousNode !== null) {
                previousNode.next = currentNode;
            }

            previousNode = currentNode;

            if (currentNode.left) {
                queue.push(currentNode.left);
            }

            if (currentNode.right) {
                queue.push(currentNode.right);
            }
        }
    }

    return root;
};
