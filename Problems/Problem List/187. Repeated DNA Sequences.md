[187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/)

# Intuition

To identify repeated 10-letter-long sequences in a DNA string, we need to use a sliding window approach combined with hashing for efficient detection of duplicates. This approach helps to find substrings of length 10 and track their occurrences in linear time.

# Approach

1. **Sliding Window**: Iterate through the string using a sliding window of length 10.
2. **Hashing**: Use a set to store unique 10-letter-long sequences and another set to store sequences that have been seen more than once.
3. **Record and Check**: For each 10-letter substring, check if it has been seen before:
    - If it has not been seen before, add it to the set of seen sequences.
    - If it has been seen before but not yet recorded as a duplicate, add it to the result list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string. Each 10-letter substring is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string. This is for storing the substrings in the hash sets.

# Code
```typescript
function findRepeatedDnaSequences(s: string): string[] {
    const seen = new Set<string>();
    const repeated = new Set<string>();
    const result: string[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - 10; i++) {
        const substring = s.substring(i, i + 10);
        if (seen.has(substring)) {
            repeated.add(substring);
        } else {
            seen.add(substring);
        }
    }

    repeated.forEach(sequence => result.push(sequence));
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize two sets: `seen` to store substrings that have been encountered, and `repeated` to store substrings that are repeated.
2. **Sliding Window**: We loop through the string with a window of size 10. The loop runs from `0` to `s.length - 10`.
3. **Check and Record**:
    - For each substring of length 10, we check if it is in the `seen` set.
    - If it is in the `seen` set, we add it to the `repeated` set.
    - If it is not in the `seen` set, we add it to `seen`.
4. **Collect Results**: Finally, we convert the `repeated` set to an array and return it.
