[84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)

# Intuition:
1. **Monotonic Stack**:
   - We use a stack to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars.
   - The stack maintains the indices in increasing order of their heights.
   - When we encounter a bar that is shorter than the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack, we calculate the area of the rectangle with the height of the bar at the top of the stack as the shortest (or limiting) bar.
2. **Area Calculation**:
   - The width of the rectangle can be determined using the current index and the index of the element at the new top of the stack after popping.
   - We continue this process until we have processed all bars and finally process the remaining bars in the stack.

# Approach:
1. Initialize an empty stack and a variable to store the maximum area.
2. Iterate through each bar in the histogram.
   - While the current bar is shorter than the bar at the top of the stack, pop the stack and calculate the area.
   - Update the maximum area if the newly calculated area is larger.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
3. After processing all bars, pop the remaining bars in the stack and calculate their areas in a similar fashion.
4. Return the maximum area found.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of bars in the histogram. Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the indices in the stack.

# Code:
```typescript
function largestRectangleArea(heights: number[]): number {
    const stack: number[] = [];
    let maxArea = 0;
    const n = heights.length;

    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        const currentHeight = i === n ? 0 : heights[i];
        while (stack.length > 0 && currentHeight < heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const h = heights[stack.pop()!];
            const width = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * width);
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return maxArea;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - An empty stack to keep track of the indices of histogram bars.
   - `maxArea` to store the maximum area found.
   - `n` to store the length of the heights array.
2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate through each index of the heights array. Additionally, we include an extra iteration at the end by checking `i <= n` to handle remaining bars in the stack.
   - For each index, determine the current height. If it's the extra iteration, set the height to 0 to force emptying the stack.
   - While the current height is less than the height of the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack, pop the stack and calculate the area.
   - Update `maxArea` if the calculated area is larger.
   - Push the current index onto the stack.
3. **Final Return**:
   - Return the `maxArea` which now contains the area of the largest rectangle found in the histogram.
