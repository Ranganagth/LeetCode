[787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

# Intuition

To find the cheapest flight from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops, we need to explore different paths and track their costs efficiently. A priority queue (min-heap) can help us prioritize the least costly paths first, ensuring we explore the cheapest options before more expensive ones.

# Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the flight information as an adjacency list where `graph[u]` contains a list of tuples `(v, price)` representing flights from city `u` to city `v` with the given price.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore the paths based on their current costs.
   - Each entry in the heap is a tuple `(current_cost, current_city, stops_remaining)`, where:
     - `current_cost` is the total cost to reach `current_city`.
     - `stops_remaining` is the number of stops left we can make.

3. **Dijkstra-like Exploration**:
   - Initialize the priority queue with the starting city `src` with cost `0` and `k + 1` stops.
   - While the heap is not empty:
     - Pop the smallest entry `(current_cost, current_city, stops_remaining)`.
     - If `current_city` is `dst`, return `current_cost` as the cheapest cost.
     - If there are stops remaining, explore all flights from `current_city` and push the new costs and cities to the heap.
   - If the heap is exhausted and `dst` is not reached, return `-1`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O((E + V) log V)***, where *E* is the number of edges (flights) and *V* is the number of vertices (cities). This is because we potentially explore all edges and use a priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(E + V)*** for the adjacency list and priority queue.

# Code

```typescript
function findCheapestPrice(n: number, flights: number[][], src: number, dst: number, k: number): number {
    const graph: Map<number, [number, number][]> = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        graph.set(i, []);
    }
    for (const [from, to, price] of flights) {
        graph.get(from)!.push([to, price]);
    }

    const pq: [number, number, number][] = [[0, src, k + 1]];
    while (pq.length > 0) {
        pq.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
        const [current_cost, current_city, stops_remaining] = pq.shift()!;
        
        if (current_city === dst) {
            return current_cost;
        }

        if (stops_remaining > 0) {
            for (const [next_city, price] of graph.get(current_city)!) {
                pq.push([current_cost + price, next_city, stops_remaining - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
};

```
