### Problem Recap:
You are tasked with finding the cheapest price from a source city (`src`) to a destination city (`dst`) with at most `K` stops. The flight information is given as a list of `[from, to, price]` triples, where `from` and `to` represent cities, and `price` is the cost of the flight.

# Intuition:

- **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is well-suited for this problem because it can handle negative weights and works in `O(n * e)` time (where `n` is the number of vertices and `e` is the number of edges).
- The algorithm's iterative nature allows us to limit the number of stops (`K`), and it efficiently computes the shortest path from the source to the destination by relaxing the edges up to `K + 1` times.

# Approach (Bellman-Ford with a Stop Constraint):

1. **Initialize Distances**:
   - We define an array `distances` where `distances[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach city `i`.
   - Initially, the distance to the source city (`src`) is 0, and all other distances are set to infinity (`INF`).

2. **Iterative Relaxation**:
   - The Bellman-Ford algorithm relaxes edges repeatedly. For this problem, we relax the edges `K + 1` times (because a path with `K` stops has `K + 1` edges).
   - During each iteration, we go through all flights and attempt to update the `distances` for each destination city based on the current minimum costs from the source city.

3. **Edge Relaxation**:
   - For each flight `(from, to, price)`, if the known minimum distance to `from` is not infinite, we check if we can get a cheaper route to `to` by passing through `from`. If so, we update `distances[to]`.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - After `K + 1` iterations, if the distance to the destination city is still infinite, it means no valid path exists within the stop constraint, so we return `-1`. Otherwise, we return the computed minimum distance.

# Time Complexity:

- ***O(K * e)***: The algorithm runs for `K + 1` iterations, and for each iteration, it processes all edges. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to `K` times the number of flights (edges).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of cities since we maintain the `distances` and `previousIterationDistances` arrays.

# Code:

```typescript
function findCheapestPrice(n: number, flights: number[][], src: number, dst: number, K: number): number {
    const INF = Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    let distances: number[] = new Array(n).fill(INF);
    let previousIterationDistances: number[];
    distances[src] = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
        previousIterationDistances = distances.slice();

        for (const flight of flights) {
            const [from, to, price] = flight;
          
            if (previousIterationDistances[from] < INF) {
                distances[to] = Math.min(distances[to], previousIterationDistances[from] + price);
            }
        }
    }

    return distances[dst] === INF ? -1 : distances[dst];
};

```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

Input:
```plaintext
n = 4
flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]]
src = 0
dst = 3
K = 1
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `distances = [0, ∞, ∞, ∞]`

2. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - Relax the flights: 
     - Flight `[0,1,100]` updates `distances[1] = 100`.
     - Flight `[1,3,600]` does nothing since `distances[1] = ∞`.
     - Flight `[2,3,200]` does nothing.
   - `distances = [0, 100, ∞, ∞]`.

3. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - Relax the flights:
     - Flight `[1,3,600]` updates `distances[3] = 100 + 600 = 700`.
     - Other flights don't lead to cheaper routes.
   - `distances = [0, 100, ∞, 700]`.

4. **Result**:
   - The minimum distance to reach `dst = 3` is `700`.

Output:
```plaintext
700
```

#### Example 2:

Input:
```plaintext
n = 3
flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0
dst = 2
K = 1
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `distances = [0, ∞, ∞]`.

2. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - Relax the flights:
     - Flight `[0,1,100]` updates `distances[1] = 100`.
     - Flight `[0,2,500]` updates `distances[2] = 500`.
   - `distances = [0, 100, 500]`.

3. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - Relax the flights:
     - Flight `[1,2,100]` updates `distances[2] = 100 + 100 = 200`.
   - `distances = [0, 100, 200]`.

4. **Result**:
   - The minimum distance to reach `dst = 2` is `200`.

Output:
```plaintext
200
```
