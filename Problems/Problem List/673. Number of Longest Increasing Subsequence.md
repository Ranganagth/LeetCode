[673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of finding the number of longest increasing subsequences in a given array `nums`, we can leverage dynamic programming. The main idea is to keep track of two key pieces of information for each element in the array:

1. `lengths[i]`: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
2. `counts[i]`: The number of longest increasing subsequences that end at index `i`.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create two arrays `lengths` and `counts` with the same length as `nums`.
   - Initialize each element in `lengths` to 1 because the minimum subsequence length ending at any element is 1 (the element itself).
   - Initialize each element in `counts` to 1 because there's at least one way to form a subsequence of length 1 at each position.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Iterate over the array with two nested loops. The outer loop runs from 0 to the end of the array, and the inner loop runs from 0 to the current index of the outer loop.
   - For each pair of indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`, if `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then `nums[i]` can extend the increasing subsequence ending at `nums[j]`.
     - If `lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]`, it means we have found a longer subsequence ending at `i`. Update `lengths[i]` and set `counts[i]` to `counts[j]`.
     - If `lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]`, it means we have found another subsequence of the same maximum length ending at `i`. Increment `counts[i]` by `counts[j]`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Determine the maximum value in the `lengths` array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
   - Sum up the values in the `counts` array for all indices where `lengths[i]` is equal to the maximum length.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)***, where *n* is the length of the array. This is due to the two nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the `lengths` and `counts` arrays.

# Code
```typescript
function findNumberOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    
    const lengths = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const counts = new Array(n).fill(1);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                if (lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]) {
                    lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1;
                    counts[i] = counts[j];
                } else if (lengths[j] + 1 === lengths[i]) {
                    counts[i] += counts[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    const maxLength = Math.max(...lengths);
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (lengths[i] === maxLength) {
            result += counts[i];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```
