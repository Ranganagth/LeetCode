[52. N-Queens II](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/)

# Intuition
The problem of finding the number of distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle can also be solved using backtracking. However, instead of returning all distinct solutions, we count the number of valid configurations.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a similar backtracking approach to place queens on the chessboard, ensuring that no two queens attack each other.
   - Use arrays `cols`, `diag1`, and `diag2` to keep track of columns and diagonals that are under attack by previously placed queens.
     - `cols[j]` keeps track of whether column `j` has a queen.
     - `diag1[k]` keeps track of whether the diagonal `(i-j)` has a queen. Diagonals of this type have the same difference `(i-j)` for their indices.
     - `diag2[k]` keeps track of whether the diagonal `(i+j)` has a queen. Diagonals of this type have the same sum `(i+j)` for their indices.
   - Start placing queens row by row. For each row `i`, try placing a queen in each column `j`.
   - Before placing a queen, check if the column `j` and diagonals `(i-j)` and `(i+j)` are under attack. If not, place the queen and mark the column and diagonals as under attack.
   - Recursively try to place queens in the subsequent rows.
   - If all rows are filled with queens, increment the count of solutions.
   - Backtrack by removing the queen and marking the column and diagonals as no longer under attack.

2. **Initialization and Counting**: 
   - Initialize arrays and variables to track columns and diagonals.
   - Start placing queens on the chessboard starting from the first row.
   - Count all valid configurations.

3. **Return**: 
   - Once all configurations are counted, return the count.

# Explanation
The backtracking approach efficiently explores all possibilities of placing queens on the chessboard. It uses arrays to keep track of columns and diagonals to ensure that no two queens are attacking each other. The solution is implemented to handle the constraints efficiently and count all valid configurations of the board.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n!)*** - Each queen placement is tried in each row, and there are `n` rows.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(n)*** - Space is used for the arrays to track columns and diagonals.

# Code
```typescript
function totalNQueens(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    const cols: boolean[] = Array(n).fill(false);
    const diag1: boolean[] = Array(2 * n - 1).fill(false);
    const diag2: boolean[] = Array(2 * n - 1).fill(false);

    function backtrack(row: number): void {
        if (row === n) {
            count++;
            return;
        }
        
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (!cols[col] && !diag1[row - col + n - 1] && !diag2[row + col]) {
                cols[col] = true;
                diag1[row - col + n - 1] = true;
                diag2[row + col] = true;
                
                backtrack(row + 1);
                
                cols[col] = false;
                diag1[row - col + n - 1] = false;
                diag2[row + col] = false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    backtrack(0);
    return count;
};

```
