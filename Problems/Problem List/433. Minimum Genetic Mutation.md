[433. Minimum Genetic Mutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/)

# Intuition
This problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem in an unweighted graph where each gene string represents a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they differ by exactly one character. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) allows us to find the shortest path (minimum number of mutations) from the `startGene` to the `endGene`.

# Approach
1. **Build the Graph**: Treat each gene string as a node and add edges between nodes that differ by exactly one character.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Initialize a queue with the `startGene` and a mutation count of 0.
   - Use a set to track visited genes to avoid processing the same gene multiple times.
   - For each gene in the queue, generate all possible one-character mutations.
   - If a mutation matches the `endGene`, return the current mutation count incremented by 1.
   - If a mutation is in the gene bank and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. **Return Result**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the `endGene`, return -1.

# Explanation
1. **BFS**: BFS is ideal for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path. By exploring all one-character mutations level by level, BFS ensures that the first time we reach the `endGene`, it is through the shortest path.
2. **Valid Mutations**: Only consider mutations that are present in the gene bank, ensuring all intermediate mutations are valid.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The BFS will process each gene at most once and will attempt to generate up to 3 possible mutations for each character position in an 8-character string. Thus, the complexity is ***O(8 * 3 * n)*** where n is the length of the gene bank.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** for storing the queue and the set of visited nodes.

# Code
```TypeScript
function minMutation(startGene: string, endGene: string, bank: string[]): number {
    const bankSet = new Set(bank);
    if (!bankSet.has(endGene)) return -1;

    const queue: [string, number][] = [[startGene, 0]];
    const visited = new Set<string>();
    visited.add(startGene);

    const charSet = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentGene, mutations] = queue.shift()!;
        
        if (currentGene === endGene) {
            return mutations;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < currentGene.length; i++) {
            for (const char of charSet) {
                if (char !== currentGene[i]) {
                    const mutatedGene = currentGene.slice(0, i) + char + currentGene.slice(i + 1);
                    if (bankSet.has(mutatedGene) && !visited.has(mutatedGene)) {
                        queue.push([mutatedGene, mutations + 1]);
                        visited.add(mutatedGene);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
};
