[61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

# Intuition
The problem is about rotating a singly linked list to the right by k places. When considering how to rotate the list, we need to ensure that the rotations are efficient and take advantage of the linked list structure.

# Approach
1. **Count the Length and Adjust k**:
   - First, traverse the linked list to count the number of nodes (`n`).
   - Adjust `k` by taking the modulo with `n` to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list length.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the linked list is empty (`head == null`), return `null`.
   - If after adjusting `k`, `k == 0`, return the original `head` since the list remains unchanged.

3. **Find the New Tail and Break the Cycle**:
   - Connect the current tail to the head to form a cycle.
   - Calculate the new tail by moving `(n - k - 1)` steps forward from the head.

4. **Set the New Head and Break the Cycle**:
   - Set the new head to the next node of the new tail.
   - Break the cycle by setting the new tail's next to null.

5. **Return the New Head**:
   - Return the new head of the rotated linked list.

# Explanation
The idea is to convert the problem of rotating a list into a problem of finding the correct break point and adjusting the pointers. By forming a cycle and carefully adjusting pointers, we can efficiently rotate the list in O(n) time complexity.

1. **Count the Length and Adjust k**:
   - Traverse the list to count the nodes and adjust `k` to be within the range of the list length.

2. **Find the New Tail and Break the Cycle**:
   - Connect the last node to the first node to form a cycle.
   - Traverse to find the new tail, which is `(n - k - 1)` steps from the head.

3. **Set the New Head and Break the Cycle**:
   - Set the new head to the next node of the new tail.
   - Break the cycle to restore the original structure.

4. **Return the New Head**:
   - Return the new head of the list after rotation.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We need to traverse the list twice: once to count the nodes and once to find the new tail.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***. We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```TypeScript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function rotateRight(head: ListNode | null, k: number): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || k === 0) {
        return head;
    }
    
    let current = head;
    let n = 1;
    while (current.next) {
        current = current.next;
        n++;
    }
    
    k = k % n;
    if (k === 0) {
        return head;
    }
    
    current.next = head;
    let newTail = head;
    for (let i = 0; i < n - k - 1; i++) {
        newTail = newTail.next!;
    }
    
    let newHead = newTail.next;
    newTail.next = null;
    
    return newHead;
};

```
