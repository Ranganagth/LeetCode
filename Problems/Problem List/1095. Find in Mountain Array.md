[1095. Find in Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-in-mountain-array/)

# Intuition

The problem requires finding the minimum index where a given `target` value appears in a "mountain array". A mountain array is defined by having an increasing sequence followed by a decreasing sequence.

# Approach

1. **Find the Peak**: 
   - First, identify the peak of the mountain array using a binary search. The peak is the point where the array switches from increasing to decreasing.
   
2. **Binary Search on Both Sides of the Peak**:
   - Perform a binary search on the left side of the peak to find the target in the increasing sequence.
   - If the target is not found on the left side, perform a binary search on the right side of the peak to find the target in the decreasing sequence.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: *O(\log n)* for finding the peak and *O(log n)* for each of the binary searches, leading to an overall time complexity of ***O(log n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are not using any extra space that scales with the input size.

# Code
```typescript
interface MountainArray {
    get(index: number): number;
    length(): number;
}

function findInMountainArray(target: number, mountainArr: MountainArray): number {
    const length = mountainArr.length();

    function findPeak(): number {
        let left = 0;
        let right = length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    function binarySearch(left: number, right: number, target: number, ascending: boolean): number {
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            const midValue = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (midValue === target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (ascending) {
                if (midValue < target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (midValue < target) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    const peak = findPeak();

    let index = binarySearch(0, peak, target, true);
    if (index !== -1) {
        return index;
    }

    return binarySearch(peak + 1, length - 1, target, false);
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **findPeak Function**: 
   - This function performs a binary search to locate the peak of the mountain array. The peak is where the sequence stops increasing and starts decreasing.

2. **binarySearch Function**: 
   - This function performs a binary search on either the increasing or decreasing part of the mountain array. The boolean parameter `ascending` determines the direction of the search.

3. **Main Function**:
   - It first finds the peak of the mountain array.
   - Then it attempts to find the target in the increasing part.
   - If the target is not found in the increasing part, it searches the decreasing part.

This solution is efficient, adhering to the constraint of making at most 100 calls to `MountainArray.get`.
