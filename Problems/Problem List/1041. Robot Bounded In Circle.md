[1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/)

# Intuition

To determine if the robot is bounded within a circle, we need to evaluate its behavior after it completes the given sequence of instructions and starts repeating them. The robot is bounded if it either:

1. Returns to its starting position (0, 0) after one cycle of instructions, or
2. Changes its direction such that subsequent cycles of instructions will eventually bring it back to the starting position.

# Approach

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - The robot starts at the origin `(0, 0)` and faces north.
   - Define the possible directions as vectors: North `(0, 1)`, East `(1, 0)`, South `(0, -1)`, and West `(-1, 0)`.

2. **Simulation**:
   - Iterate through each instruction and update the robot's position or direction accordingly.
   - For `G`, move the robot in the current direction.
   - For `L` and `R`, update the direction based on the current direction.

3. **Check Position and Direction**:
   - After executing the entire instruction sequence once, check the robot's position and direction.
   - If the robot is back at the origin `(0, 0)`, it is bounded.
   - If the robot is not facing north after completing the instructions, it is also bounded because subsequent cycles will eventually return it to the origin.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the instruction string. We process each instruction once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use a fixed amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function isRobotBounded(instructions: string): boolean {
    const directions = [
        [0, 1],
        [1, 0],
        [0, -1],
        [-1, 0]
    ];
    
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    let dirIndex = 0;

    for (const instruction of instructions) {
        if (instruction === 'G') {
            x += directions[dirIndex][0];
            y += directions[dirIndex][1];
        } else if (instruction === 'L') {
            dirIndex = (dirIndex + 3) % 4;
        } else if (instruction === 'R') {
            dirIndex = (dirIndex + 1) % 4;
        }
    }

    return (x === 0 && y === 0) || dirIndex !== 0;
};

```

## Example usage
```Typescript
console.log(isRobotBounded("GGLLGG")); // Output: true
console.log(isRobotBounded("GG"));     // Output: false
console.log(isRobotBounded("GL"));     // Output: true
```

### Explanation of Examples

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Instructions: "GGLLGG"
   - Path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,1) -> (0,0)
   - The robot returns to the starting point after one cycle. Hence, the result is `true`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Instructions: "GG"
   - Path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2)
   - The robot continues moving north indefinitely. Hence, the result is `false`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Instructions: "GL"
   - Path: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (-1,1) -> (-1,0) -> (0,0)
   - The robot returns to the starting point after one cycle. Hence, the result is `true`.
