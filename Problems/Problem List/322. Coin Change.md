[322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

### Problem

You're given an array `coins` representing coin denominations and an integer `amount`. The task is to return the **minimum number of coins** needed to make up that amount. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

---

# Intuition

This is a classic **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problem. The idea is to build up a solution for every amount from `0` to `amount` using the **minimum number of coins**.

* Think of `dp[x]` as the minimum coins required to make amount `x`.
* For every coin, we iterate through `dp[coin]` to `dp[amount]`, and for each value, try to **minimize** the number of coins used.

---

# Approach

1. Create a `dp` array of size `amount + 1`, filled with `Infinity`, since initially all amounts are unreachable.
2. Set `dp[0] = 0`, since 0 coins are needed to make amount 0.
3. Loop through each coin:
   * For each value from `coin` to `amount`, update:
     ```
     dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
     ```
4. If `dp[amount]` is still `Infinity`, return `-1` (not reachable). Else, return `dp[amount]`.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(amount * n)`
  where `n` is the number of coins.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(amount)`

---

# Code

```ts
function coinChange(coins: number[], amount: number): number {
    const dp: number[] = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (const coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }

    return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1

**Input:** `coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11`

* Build `dp` array:

  ```
  dp[0] = 0
  dp[1] = 1         // 1
  dp[2] = 1         // 2
  dp[3] = 2         // 2 + 1
  dp[5] = 1         // 5
  dp[6] = 2         // 5 + 1
  dp[10] = 2        // 5 + 5
  dp[11] = 3        // 5 + 5 + 1
  ```

Output: `3`

#### Example 2

**Input:** `coins = [2], amount = 3`

* dp[3] will never be updated from Infinity.
  Output: `-1`

#### Example 3

**Input:** `coins = [1], amount = 0`

* No coins needed.
  Output: `0`

### **Summary**

Dynamic Programming helps to build the solution bottom-up by exploring all possible combinations efficiently. This problem is a great example of **unbounded knapsack** where we can take coins multiple times.
