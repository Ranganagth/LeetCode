[1572. Matrix Diagonal Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to sum the elements on both the primary and secondary diagonals of a square matrix. The primary diagonal consists of elements where the row index is equal to the column index (`mat[i][i]`). The secondary diagonal consists of elements where the row index and column index sum to `n-1` (`mat[i][n-1-i]`), where `n` is the length of the matrix.

The challenge is to ensure that we don't double-count the middle element if the matrix has an odd dimension since it will be part of both the primary and secondary diagonals.

# Approach
1. **Primary Diagonal**: Sum the elements where the row and column indices are equal.
2. **Secondary Diagonal**: Sum the elements where the sum of the row and column indices equals `n-1`.
3. **Avoid Double Counting**: If the matrix has an odd size, the center element will be included in both diagonals. Subtract it once if this occurs.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the matrix. We iterate through the matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as no extra space is required beyond a few variables.

# Code
```typescript
function diagonalSum(mat: number[][]): number {
    let n = mat.length;
    let totalSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        totalSum += mat[i][i];
        totalSum += mat[i][n - 1 - i];
    }

    if (n % 2 !== 0) {
        totalSum -= mat[Math.floor(n / 2)][Math.floor(n / 2)];
    }

    return totalSum;
};

```

### Explanation
- The function `diagonalSum` takes a square matrix `mat` and initializes the variable `totalSum` to store the sum of the diagonals.
- We loop through the matrix, adding the elements of the primary diagonal (`mat[i][i]`) and the secondary diagonal (`mat[i][n - 1 - i]`) to `totalSum`.
- If the matrix has an odd length, we subtract the center element (`mat[Math.floor(n / 2)][Math.floor(n / 2)]`) to avoid counting it twice.
- Finally, we return the `totalSum`, which is the sum of the diagonals of the matrix.
