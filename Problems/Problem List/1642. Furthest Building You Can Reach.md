# Intuition
To determine the furthest building that can be reached using a given number of bricks and ladders, we need to make strategic decisions about resource allocation. Ladders should be prioritized for the largest jumps to conserve bricks for smaller jumps.

# Approach
1. **Priority Queue**: Use a min-priority queue (min-heap) to track the largest jumps requiring ladders.
2. **Iterate through Buildings**:
   - Calculate the height difference to the next building.
   - If the next building is higher, enqueue the height difference.
   - If the queue size exceeds the number of ladders, use bricks to cover the smallest jump (dequeue from the queue).
   - If bricks run out, return the current building index as the furthest reachable building.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log k)***, where `n` is the number of buildings and `k` is the number of ladders. Each insertion and deletion operation in the priority queue takes *O(log k)* time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)***, as the priority queue stores at most `k` elements.

# Code

```typescript
function furthestBuilding(heights: number[], bricks: number, ladders: number): number {
    const n = heights.length;
    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        let diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
        if (diff > 0) pq.enqueue(diff);
        if (pq.size() > ladders) bricks -= pq.dequeue().element;
        if (bricks < 0) return i;
    }
    
    return n - 1;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - A min-priority queue (`pq`) is initialized to keep track of the height differences that might need ladders.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each building, calculate the height difference (`diff`) to the next building.
   - If `diff` is positive (next building is taller), enqueue `diff` to the priority queue.
   - If the size of the priority queue exceeds the number of ladders, use bricks to cover the smallest jump by dequeuing from the queue and subtracting the value from `bricks`.
   - If `bricks` falls below zero, return the current index `i` as the furthest reachable building.

3. **Result**:
   - If the loop completes without running out of bricks, return the index of the last building as the furthest reachable building.
