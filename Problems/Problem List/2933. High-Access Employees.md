[2933. High-Access Employees](https://leetcode.com/problems/high-access-employees/)

# Intuition:

We are given access logs with timestamps for different employees and need to determine which employees accessed the system three or more times within any one-hour period. To do this, we:
1. Sort the access times for each employee.
2. Check if three or more consecutive times fall within a one-hour window.
3. If they do, we mark the employee as high-access.

# Approach:

1. **Group by Employee**:
   - We need to first group the access times by employee names. This will allow us to easily check access patterns for each employee separately.

2. **Sort Access Times**:
   - For each employee, sort their access times. Sorting is necessary because we need to evaluate consecutive accesses to see if they fall within a one-hour window.

3. **Sliding Window to Check Time Range**:
   - After sorting the times, we can use a sliding window approach:
     - Check each group of three consecutive times.
     - If the third time minus the first time in the group is less than 60 minutes, we count it as a valid high-access case.

4. **Convert Time**:
   - The access times are given in `HHMM` format. To facilitate comparison, we can convert the time to total minutes from midnight (i.e., `HH * 60 + MM`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Employees with fewer than three access times cannot be considered high-access, so we skip them.
   - Access times that span more than one hour (e.g., "0800" and "0915") should not be counted as within one hour.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting, where *n* is the number of access logs.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, as we are storing grouped access logs and the result.

# Code:

```typescript
function highAccessEmployees(access_times: string[][]): string[] {
    const convertToMinutes = (time: string): number => {
        const hours = parseInt(time.substring(0, 2));
        const minutes = parseInt(time.substring(2, 4));
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    const employeeAccessMap: Record<string, number[]> = {};

    for (const [employee, time] of access_times) {
        if (!(employee in employeeAccessMap)) {
            employeeAccessMap[employee] = [];
        }
        employeeAccessMap[employee].push(convertToMinutes(time));
    }

    const highAccessEmployees: string[] = [];

    for (const employee in employeeAccessMap) {
        const times = employeeAccessMap[employee];
        
        times.sort((a, b) => a - b);

        for (let i = 0; i <= times.length - 3; i++) {
            const firstTime = times[i];
            const thirdTime = times[i + 2];

            if (thirdTime - firstTime < 60) {
                highAccessEmployees.push(employee);
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return highAccessEmployees;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **`convertToMinutes(time)`**:
   - This helper function converts a time in `HHMM` format into total minutes from midnight. For example, "0800" becomes `8 * 60 = 480` minutes and "0549" becomes `5 * 60 + 49 = 349` minutes.

2. **Populating `employeeAccessMap`**:
   - We iterate through the access logs, grouping the access times by employee name. Each employee’s access times are stored in an array as total minutes.

3. **Sorting Times**:
   - For each employee, we sort their list of access times. Sorting allows us to easily check if three consecutive accesses are within one hour.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - For each employee, we use a sliding window to check every group of three consecutive access times. If the time difference between the first and the third access is less than 60 minutes, the employee is marked as high-access.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If an employee has fewer than three access times, the loop checking for high-access will be skipped.
   - The sliding window ensures we only count groups of three accesses within a one-hour period.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: 
```ts
access_times = [["a", "0549"], ["b", "0457"], ["a", "0532"], ["a", "0621"], ["b", "0540"]]
```

- **Step 1**: Convert the access times:
  - "a" has access times: [0532, 0549, 0621] → [332, 349, 381]
  - "b" has access times: [0457, 0540] → [297, 340]

- **Step 2**: Sort and check:
  - For "a", the sorted times are `[332, 349, 381]`. The difference between 381 and 332 is less than 60 minutes, so "a" is a high-access employee.
  - For "b", there are fewer than three access times, so "b" is not a high-access employee.

**Output**: `["a"]`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: 
```ts
access_times = [["d","0002"],["c","0808"],["c","0829"],["e","0215"],["d","1508"],["d","1444"],["d","1410"],["c","0809"]]
```

- **Step 1**: Convert the access times:
  - "c" has access times: [0808, 0829, 0809] → [488, 509, 489]
  - "d" has access times: [0002, 1508, 1444, 1410] → [2, 908, 884, 850]

- **Step 2**: Sort and check:
  - For "c", the sorted times are `[488, 489, 509]`. The difference between 509 and 488 is less than 60 minutes, so "c" is high-access.
  - For "d", the sorted times are `[850, 884, 908]`. The difference between 908 and 850 is less than 60 minutes, so "d" is high-access.

**Output**: `["c", "d"]`

### Final Notes:
- This solution uses sorting and a sliding window approach to efficiently identify employees with three or more accesses within a one-hour period.
- Sorting the times allows for an easy check of consecutive access logs, making the approach optimal for this problem size.
