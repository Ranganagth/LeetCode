[191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

# Intuition

The Hamming weight of a number is the number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation. We can compute this by examining each bit of the number one by one.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `count` initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of set bits.
   
2. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - Use a loop to iterate over each bit of the number `n`.
   - In each iteration, do the following:
     - Use bitwise AND (`&`) with 1 to check if the least significant bit (LSB) of `n` is set (i.e., if it is 1).
     - Add the result of this operation to `count`.
     - Right shift `n` by 1 to process the next bit in the next iteration.

3. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, which means all bits have been processed.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)***. The algorithm always processes a fixed number of bits (32 bits for a 32-bit integer) regardless of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. We use a constant amount of space.

# Code
```typescript
function hammingWeight(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    while (n !== 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return count;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of set bits.

2. **Loop Through Bits**:
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is not 0.
   - `n & 1` checks the LSB of `n` and adds 1 to `count` if it is set.
   - `n >>>= 1` performs a logical right shift, discarding the LSB and shifting in a 0 from the left. This prepares `n` for the next iteration.

3. **Return Count**:
   - After all bits have been processed and `n` becomes 0, `count` contains the total number of set bits in the original number.

### Optimizations

- **Bit Manipulation Tricks**:
  - Instead of always shifting `n`, we can use a trick to remove the lowest set bit in each iteration: `n &= (n - 1)`. This operation directly flips the lowest set bit to 0 and keeps the rest unchanged, effectively reducing the number of iterations to the number of set bits.
  
#### Optimized Code
```typescript
function hammingWeight(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    while (n !== 0) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
};

```
