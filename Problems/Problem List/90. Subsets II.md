[90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)

# Intuition
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array to ensure that duplicates are adjacent.
2. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible subsets.
3. **Skip Duplicates**: When encountering a duplicate element, skip it if it hasn't been included in the current subset to avoid generating duplicate subsets.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Input**: Sort the array to handle duplicates more effectively.
2. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a helper function to generate subsets recursively.
   - At each step, decide whether to include the current element.
   - Skip elements that have been included in the previous step if they are duplicates.
3. **Result Collection**: Collect all unique subsets during the recursive process.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)***, where n is the length of the array. This is because each element can either be included or excluded.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)*** to store all subsets.

# Code
```typescript
function subsetsWithDup(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    function backtrack(start: number, path: number[]) {
        result.push([...path]);

        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i > start && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;
            
            path.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, path);
            path.pop();
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, []);
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted to ensure duplicates are adjacent.
2. **Backtracking Function**: The `backtrack` function generates subsets starting from a given index.
    - It adds the current subset to the result.
    - It iterates through the array starting from the current index.
    - If the current element is the same as the previous one and not the starting element, it skips to avoid duplicates.
    - It recursively includes the current element in the subset and proceeds to the next element.
    - It backtracks by removing the current element from the subset.
3. **Initiate Backtracking**: The initial call to `backtrack` starts with an empty subset and index `0`.
