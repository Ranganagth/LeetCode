[202. Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

# Intuition
A happy number will eventually reach 1 if you repeatedly replace it by the sum of the square of its digits. If it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1, it is not a happy number.

# Approach
1. **Slow and Fast Pointers**: We will use two pointers, a slow pointer that computes the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`, and a fast pointer that computes this sum twice as fast. If `n` is a happy number, the slow pointer will eventually reach 1, and the fast pointer will reach 1 shortly after the slow pointer. If there's no cycle, the fast pointer will reach 1 first.

2. **Cycle Detection**: Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to detect cycles. If the slow and fast pointers ever meet (other than at 1), there is a cycle and the number is not happy.

3. **Termination**: If we reach 1, return `true` as `n` is a happy number.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where n is the given number. This is because the number of digits in `n` is roughly proportional to log n.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
    function getNext(n: number): number {
        let sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            const digit = n % 10;
            sum += digit * digit;
            n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    let slow = n;
    let fast = getNext(n);
    
    while (fast !== 1 && slow !== fast) {
        slow = getNext(slow);
        fast = getNext(getNext(fast));
    }
    
    return fast === 1;
};
