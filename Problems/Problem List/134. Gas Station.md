[134. Gas Station](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

# Intuition
The problem of finding the starting gas station from which you can complete the circuit can be approached by understanding the balance of gas available at each station versus the cost required to reach the next station. If at any point in the circuit, the total gas becomes negative, it means starting from that station is not feasible.

# Approach
1. **Calculate Total Gas and Total Cost:** If the total gas available is less than the total cost required, then it's impossible to complete the circuit.
2. **Identify the Starting Point:** Initialize `total_tank` and `current_tank` to 0. Iterate through each station:
   - Update the `total_tank` and `current_tank` by adding the difference between `gas[i]` and `cost[i]`.
   - If `current_tank` becomes negative, it means you cannot start the journey from the current starting point. Set the next station as the new starting point and reset `current_tank`.

# Explanation
- **Total Tank Check:** Summing up all gas and cost values helps in the initial feasibility check. If `total_tank` is negative after one full iteration, return `-1`.
- **Greedy Check:** The greedy approach helps to find the feasible starting point efficiently. By resetting the `current_tank` and updating the starting index whenever `current_tank` drops below zero, we ensure that the next station could potentially be the starting point.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of gas stations. This is because we only pass through the list once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, as we only use a few extra variables.

# Code
```typescript
function canCompleteCircuit(gas: number[], cost: number[]): number {
    let total_tank = 0;
    let current_tank = 0;
    let starting_station = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
        total_tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
        current_tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
        
        if (current_tank < 0) {
            starting_station = i + 1;
            current_tank = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return total_tank >= 0 ? starting_station : -1;
};

```
