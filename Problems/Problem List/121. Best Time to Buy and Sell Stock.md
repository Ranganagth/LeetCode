[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

# Intuition:
To maximize the profit, we need to find the smallest price to buy (`minPrice`) and the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling at the current price (`price`) minus `minPrice`.

# Approach:
- Initialize `minPrice` to `Infinity` to ensure any price will be smaller.
- Initialize `maxProfit` to `0` since the minimum profit is `0` if no transactions are made.
- Iterate through the `prices` array:
  - Update `minPrice` to be the minimum of itself and the current `price`.
  - Update `maxProfit` to be the maximum of itself and the difference between the current `price` and `minPrice`.
- After iterating through all prices, `maxProfit` will contain the maximum profit achievable.

# Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of prices in the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code:
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let minPrice = Infinity;
    let maxProfit = 0;

    for (let price of prices) {
        minPrice = Math.min(minPrice, price);
        maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
    }

    return maxProfit;
};

```
