[133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

# Intuition
The problem is to clone a graph, which means creating a deep copy of the graph such that the new graph is structurally identical to the original graph, with all nodes and edges replicated.

# Approach
1. **Using Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We'll use a DFS approach to traverse the original graph.
2. **Cloning Nodes**: We will maintain a map to track nodes that have already been cloned. If a node is visited, it is already cloned and added to the map.
3. **Cloning Neighbors**: For each node, we recursively clone its neighbors and add them to the cloned node's neighbor list.
4. **Handling Base Cases**: Handle base cases like the input node being null.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(N + E)***, where *N* is the number of nodes and *E* is the number of edges. This is because we visit each node and each edge exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(N)***, for storing the visited map and the recursion stack.

# Code
```typescript
class Node {
    val: number;
    neighbors: Node[];
    constructor(val?: number, neighbors?: Node[]) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.neighbors = (neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors);
    }
}

function cloneGraph(node: Node | null): Node | null {
    if (node === null) return null;

    const visited: Map<number, Node> = new Map();

    function cloneNode(originalNode: Node | null): Node | null {
        if (originalNode === null) return null;

        if (visited.has(originalNode.val)) {
            return visited.get(originalNode.val)!;
        }

        const clonedNode = new Node(originalNode.val);
        visited.set(clonedNode.val, clonedNode);

        for (let neighbor of originalNode.neighbors) {
            clonedNode.neighbors.push(cloneNode(neighbor));
        }

        return clonedNode;
    }

    return cloneNode(node);
}
```
