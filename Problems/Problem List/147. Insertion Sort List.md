[147. Insertion Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insertion-sort-list/)

# Intuition:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it provides several advantages:

- It is simple and intuitive.
- It is efficient for very small data sets or data sets that are already mostly sorted.

For a singly linked list, insertion sort works by maintaining a sorted part of the list and iteratively inserting each unsorted element into its correct position in the sorted part.

# Approach:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the list is empty or has only one node, it is already sorted. So, we can directly return the head.

2. **Initialization**:
   - We'll maintain a `dummyHead` node to facilitate easier insertion operations at the beginning of the list.
   - Traverse through the list using a `current` pointer starting from the head.

3. **Insertion Sort Logic**:
   - For each node starting from the second node (`current` starts from `head.next`), we'll check where this node should be inserted relative to the sorted part of the list.
   - Use two pointers, `prev` to track the last node in the sorted list and `next` to store the next node to be processed in the original list.
   - If `current.val` is greater than or equal to `prev.val`, move `prev` to the right.
   - Otherwise, find the correct position for `current` and insert it after `prev`.

4. **Updating Pointers**:
   - After sorting, update the `next` pointer to the next unsorted node.
   - Continue this process until all nodes have been sorted.

5. **Return the Sorted List**:
   - After the traversal and sorting, return the `dummyHead.next`, which is the head of the sorted list.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)***. This is because in the worst case, each node may need to be inserted into its correct position, which would require traversing all previously sorted nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. We are only using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function insertionSortList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }
    
    const dummyHead = new ListNode();
    dummyHead.next = head;
    
    let current = head.next;
    let prev = head;
    
    while (current) {
        if (prev.val <= current.val) {
            prev = prev.next;
        } else {
            let innerPrev = dummyHead;
            while (innerPrev.next.val <= current.val) {
                innerPrev = innerPrev.next;
            }
            prev.next = current.next;
            current.next = innerPrev.next;
            innerPrev.next = current;
        }
        current = prev.next;
    }
    
    return dummyHead.next;
};

```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: We initialize a `dummyHead` to simplify insertion at the beginning of the list. This helps in handling edge cases and ensures the head can change during sorting without complications.
- **Sorting Logic**: We iterate through the list with `current` starting from the second node. For each node, we determine where it should be inserted relative to the sorted part of the list.
- **Insertion**: We use `prev` to keep track of the last node in the sorted list and `innerPrev` to find the correct position for `current` to be inserted.
- **Return**: Finally, we return `dummyHead.next`, which is the head of the sorted list.
