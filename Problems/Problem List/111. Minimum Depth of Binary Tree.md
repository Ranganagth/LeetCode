[111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
- **BFS Approach**: This is more suitable for finding the minimum depth because it explores nodes level by level. As soon as we encounter the first leaf node, we can return the depth.
- **DFS Approach**: This involves exploring all possible paths to find the shortest one, which can be less efficient than BFS for this specific problem.

# Approach
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal.
   - Enqueue the root node with a depth of 1.
   - For each node, check if it is a leaf node. If it is, return the current depth.
   - Otherwise, enqueue its non-null children with depth incremented by 1.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** (optional):
   - Use a recursive function to find the minimum depth.
   - For each node, recursively find the minimum depth of its left and right subtrees.
   - Return the minimum of these depths plus one.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(N)*** where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree, since we might visit all nodes in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(N)*** for the BFS approach due to the queue, which in the worst case could hold all nodes of the last level.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function minDepth(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    let queue: Array<{ node: TreeNode, depth: number }> = [{ node: root, depth: 1 }];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let { node, depth } = queue.shift()!;
        
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            return depth;
        }
        
        if (node.left) {
            queue.push({ node: node.left, depth: depth + 1 });
        }
        
        if (node.right) {
            queue.push({ node: node.right, depth: depth + 1 });
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Edge Case**: If the tree is empty (`root` is `null`), return `0` since the depth is zero.
2. **Queue Initialization**: Start with the root node at depth 1.
3. **Level Order Traversal**: Use a loop to process nodes in the queue. For each node:
   - Check if it's a leaf node. If it is, return the current depth.
   - If not, enqueue its children with depth incremented by 1.
4. **Return Depth**: As soon as we encounter a leaf node, we return the current depth. This ensures the minimum depth is found.
