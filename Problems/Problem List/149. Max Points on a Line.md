[149. Max Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/)

# Intuition

To find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line, we can leverage the geometric property that points on the same line share the same slope between any pair of points. Therefore, the key is to compute the slope between every pair of points and count how many points share the same slope with respect to a reference point.

# Approach

1. **Iterate Through Each Point as a Reference**: For each point, consider it as a reference point and calculate the slope of the line between this point and every other point.

2. **Calculate Slope Using Simplified Fractions**: To avoid precision issues with floating-point arithmetic, compute the slope using the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the slope to its simplest form. This ensures that all equivalent slopes are represented consistently.

3. **Count Slopes Using a Hash Map**: Use a hash map to keep track of how many times each slope appears for the current reference point.

4. **Update the Maximum Count**: For each reference point, update the global maximum count of points that lie on the same line.

5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where there is only one point or duplicate points (although the latter is not allowed by the problem constraints).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ² log C)***, where `n` is the number of points and `C` is the maximum coordinate value (the **(log C)** factor comes from the GCD computation).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the hash map that stores the slopes.

# Code 
```typescript
function maxPoints(points: number[][]): number {
    const gcd = (a: number, b: number): number => {
        while (b !== 0) {
            const temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    };

    if (points.length < 3) return points.length;

    let maxPointsOnLine = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        const slopes = new Map<string, number>();
        let samePoint = 1;
        
        for (let j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
            if (i !== j) {
                let dx = points[j][0] - points[i][0];
                let dy = points[j][1] - points[i][1];
                
                if (dx === 0 && dy === 0) {
                    samePoint++;
                    continue;
                }
                
                const gcdValue = gcd(dx, dy);
                dx /= gcdValue;
                dy /= gcdValue;
                
                const slope = `${dx}/${dy}`;
                slopes.set(slope, (slopes.get(slope) || 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        let maxPointsFromCurrent = samePoint;
        for (const count of slopes.values()) {
            maxPointsFromCurrent = Math.max(maxPointsFromCurrent, count + samePoint);
        }
        
        maxPointsOnLine = Math.max(maxPointsOnLine, maxPointsFromCurrent);
    }
    
    return maxPointsOnLine;
};
