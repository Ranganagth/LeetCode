[2049. Count Nodes With the Highest Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-with-the-highest-score/)

# Intuition

The problem requires calculating the "score" for each node in a tree. The score is the product of the sizes of the resulting subtrees when the node and its edges are removed. This involves:

1. **Tree Representation**: Using an adjacency list to represent the tree based on the `parents` array.
2. **Subtree Size Calculation**: Using a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree rooted at every node.
3. **Score Calculation**: Iterating through each node, removing it, and calculating the product of the sizes of the resulting subtrees.
4. **Finding Maximum Scores**: Keeping track of the highest score and counting how many nodes achieve this score.

# Approach

1. **Build the Tree**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Calculate Subtree Sizes**: Use DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.
3. **Calculate Scores**: For each node, calculate its score by considering the sizes of the subtrees formed by its removal.
4. **Track Maximum Scores**: Keep track of the highest score and the count of nodes achieving that score.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we traverse each node and its children a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the adjacency list and subtree sizes.

# Code

```typescript
function countHighestScoreNodes(parents: number[]): number {
    const n = parents.length;
    const children: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const subtreeSize = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        children[parents[i]].push(i);
    }

    function calculateSubtreeSize(node: number): number {
        let size = 1;
        for (const child of children[node]) {
            size += calculateSubtreeSize(child);
        }
        subtreeSize[node] = size;
        return size;
    }

    calculateSubtreeSize(0);

    let maxScore = 0;
    let countMaxScore = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let score = 1;
        let remainingNodes = n - subtreeSize[i];
        
        if (remainingNodes > 0) {
            score *= remainingNodes;
        }
        for (const child of children[i]) {
            score *= subtreeSize[child];
        }

        if (score > maxScore) {
            maxScore = score;
            countMaxScore = 1;
        } else if (score === maxScore) {
            countMaxScore++;
        }
    }

    return countMaxScore;
};

```

### Example usage:

```
const parents1 = [-1, 2, 0, 2, 0];
console.log(countHighestScoreNodes(parents1)); // Output: 3

const parents2 = [-1, 2, 0];
console.log(countHighestScoreNodes(parents2)); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation of Example

**Example 1**:
- Input: `parents = [-1, 2, 0, 2, 0]`
- The tree structure:
  ```
       0
      / \
     2   4
    / \
   1   3
  ```
- Scores:
  - Node 0: `3 * 1 = 3`
  - Node 1: `4 = 4`
  - Node 2: `1 * 1 * 2 = 2`
  - Node 3: `4 = 4`
  - Node 4: `4 = 4`
- Highest score is 4, achieved by nodes 1, 3, and 4.

**Example 2**:
- Input: `parents = [-1, 2, 0]`
- The tree structure:
  ```
	     0
	    /
	   2
	  /
	 1
  ```
- Scores:
  - Node 0: `2 = 2`
  - Node 1: `2 = 2`
  - Node 2: `1 * 1 = 1`
- Highest score is 2, achieved by nodes 0 and 1.
