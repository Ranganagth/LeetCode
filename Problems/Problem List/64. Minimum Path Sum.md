[64. Minimum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)

# Intuition

To find the minimum path sum in a grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, we can use dynamic programming. The core idea is to build a table (`dp`) where each cell contains the minimum sum needed to reach that cell. We can only move right or down, so the value of each cell in `dp` depends on the values of the cell directly above it and the cell directly to the left of it.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of the same dimensions as the input grid.
   - Initialize the top-left cell of `dp` with the value of the top-left cell of the grid since this is our starting point.

2. **Filling the First Row and Column**:
   - The minimum sum to reach any cell in the first row is the sum of all previous cells in the same row.
   - Similarly, the minimum sum to reach any cell in the first column is the sum of all previous cells in the same column.

3. **Filling the Rest of the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid that is not in the first row or column, the minimum path sum to that cell is the value of the cell plus the minimum of the path sums from the cell above it and the cell to the left of it.

4. **Result Extraction**:
   - The value at the bottom-right cell of the `dp` table will contain the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each cell of the grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, for the `dp` table. However, this can be optimized to O(n) if we use a single array to store the current row's values since each cell only depends on the current and the previous row.

# Code
```typescript
function minPathSum(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];

    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + grid[0][j];
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + grid[i][0];
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
        }
    }

    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `m` and `n` represent the number of rows and columns in the grid.
   - `dp` is initialized to be a 2D array of the same dimensions as `grid`, with all values set to 0.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - The value of `dp[0][0]` is set to `grid[0][0]` because thatâ€™s the starting point.

3. **Filling the First Row and Column**:
   - The first for-loop fills the first row of `dp` by adding the value of the current cell in the grid to the value of the previous cell in `dp`.
   - The second for-loop does the same for the first column.

4. **Filling the Rest of the DP Table**:
   - The nested for-loops go through the rest of the grid, filling each cell of `dp` with the minimum path sum to reach that cell.

5. **Result Extraction**:
   - Finally, `dp[m-1][n-1]` gives the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
