[1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-to-zero/)

# Intuition
We need to perform operations on `num` until it reaches zero. For each step:
- If `num` is even, divide it by 2.
- If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.

# Approach
1. **Iterative Reduction**: Use a while loop to continually reduce `num` until it becomes zero.
2. **Condition Checking**: Inside the loop:
   - If `num` is even (`num % 2 === 0`), divide it by 2.
   - If `num` is odd, subtract 1 from it.
3. **Count Steps**: Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of steps taken to reduce `num` to zero.
4. **Return the Result**: Once `num` becomes zero, return the counter which contains the number of steps taken.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where *n* is the value of `num`. This is because each step in the worst case will halve `num`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function numberOfSteps(num: number): number {
    let steps = 0;
    
    while (num > 0) {
        if (num % 2 === 0) {
            num /= 2;
        } else {
            num -= 1;
        }
        steps++;
    }
    
    return steps;
};

```

### Explanation
1. We initialize a counter `steps` to zero.
2. We enter a while loop that continues as long as `num` is greater than zero.
3. Inside the loop, we check if `num` is even (`num % 2 === 0`). If true, we divide `num` by 2; otherwise, we subtract 1 from `num`.
4. In each iteration of the loop, we increment the `steps` counter.
5. Once `num` becomes zero, the loop terminates, and we return the `steps` counter which now contains the number of steps taken.
