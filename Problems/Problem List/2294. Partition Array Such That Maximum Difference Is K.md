[2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-such-that-maximum-difference-is-k/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to partition the array into the smallest number of subsequences such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is at most `k`. 

Given the constraints, sorting the array first helps simplify the problem. Once sorted, the problem reduces to finding groups of numbers where the difference between the smallest and largest number in each group is at most `k`.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. This allows us to easily find subsequences where the difference between the maximum and minimum values is minimized.
2. **Greedy Grouping**: Iterate through the sorted array and group elements together while the difference between the current element and the start of the current group is less than or equal to `k`. When this condition no longer holds, start a new subsequence.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step. The subsequent iteration through the array is **O(n)**, making the overall time complexity ***O(n log n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** for the extra space used, since we are modifying the input array in place (if needed) and using a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Code

```typescript
function partitionArray(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let subsequences = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (i < nums.length) {
        subsequences++;
        let j = i;

        while (j < nums.length && nums[j] - nums[i] <= k) {
            j++;
        }

        i = j;
    }

    return subsequences;
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted to easily group elements that satisfy the condition of the maximum difference being at most `k`.
2. **Initializing Counters**: A counter `subsequences` is used to count the number of subsequences needed.
3. **Grouping Elements**: Using a while loop, elements are grouped together until the condition `nums[j] - nums[i] <= k` is violated, at which point a new subsequence is started.
4. **Moving to Next Group**: The index `i` is updated to the start of the next ungrouped element.
