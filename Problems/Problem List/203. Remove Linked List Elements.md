[203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of removing all nodes with a given value from a linked list, we can use a simple traversal approach. We'll iterate through the list, and whenever we encounter a node with the specified value, we'll remove it by adjusting the pointers of the previous node.

# Approach

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the list is empty (`head` is `null`), simply return `null`.

2. **Dummy Node**:
   - Use a dummy node to simplify the removal of nodes, especially the head node. The dummy node's next pointer will point to the head of the list.

3. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse the list using two pointers: `prev` (initially pointing to the dummy node) and `curr` (initially pointing to the head).
   - For each node, if `curr.val` equals the given value, adjust the `next` pointer of `prev` to skip the current node.
   - If `curr.val` does not equal the given value, move `prev` to `curr`.
   - Move `curr` to the next node in the list.

4. **Return**:
   - Finally, return `dummy.next`, which is the new head of the modified list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, no extra space is used apart from a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function removeElements(head: ListNode | null, val: number): ListNode | null {
    const dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let prev = dummy;
    let curr = head;

    while (curr !== null) {
        if (curr.val === val) {
            prev.next = curr.next;
        } else {
            prev = curr;
        }
        curr = curr.next;
    }

    return dummy.next;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **ListNode Class**:
   - The `ListNode` class defines the structure of a node in the linked list.

2. **removeElements Function**:
   - The function `removeElements` takes the head of the list and the value to be removed as arguments.

3. **Dummy Node**:
   - A dummy node is created and its next pointer is set to the head of the list.

4. **Traversal**:
   - Two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, are used to traverse the list. `prev` starts at the dummy node and `curr` starts at the head.
   - During the traversal, if `curr.val` equals the value to be removed, `prev.next` is updated to `curr.next` to skip the current node.
   - Otherwise, `prev` is moved to `curr`.

5. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the modified list.
