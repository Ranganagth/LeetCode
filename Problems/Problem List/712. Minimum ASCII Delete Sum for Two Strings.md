[712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal. This problem can be reduced to finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the two strings, because the characters that are not in the LCS need to be deleted. By deleting these characters, we can calculate the ASCII sum of these deleted characters.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make the first `i` characters of `s1` equal to the first `j` characters of `s2`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - For the first row (`dp[0][j]`), the cost is the sum of ASCII values of characters in `s2` up to `j` because we need to delete all characters in `s2` to match an empty `s1`.
   - For the first column (`dp[i][0]`), the cost is the sum of ASCII values of characters in `s1` up to `i` because we need to delete all characters in `s1` to match an empty `s2`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each character in `s1` and `s2`, if they match (`s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]`), no deletion is needed, and we take the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If they don't match, we consider two cases:
     - Deleting `s1[i-1]` and hence we add its ASCII value to `dp[i-1][j]`.
     - Deleting `s2[j-1]` and hence we add its ASCII value to `dp[i][j-1]`.
   - The value of `dp[i][j]` will be the minimum of these two cases.

4. **Result**:
   - The value at `dp[m][n]` (where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`) will give us the minimum ASCII sum of deleted characters to make both strings equal.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where m and n are the lengths of `s1` and `s2` respectively. We need to fill a table of size `m * n`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** for storing the DP table. However, we can optimize it to ***O(min(m, n))*** if we use a rolling array.

# Code
```typescript
function minimumDeleteSum(s1: string, s2: string): number {
    const m = s1.length;
    const n = s2.length;

    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + s2.charCodeAt(j - 1);
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + s1.charCodeAt(i - 1);
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (s1[i - 1] === s2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j] + s1.charCodeAt(i - 1), dp[i][j - 1] + s2.charCodeAt(j - 1));
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
};

```
