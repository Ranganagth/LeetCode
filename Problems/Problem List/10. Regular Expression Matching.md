[10. Regular Expression Matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)

# Intuition
The problem is a typical dynamic programming (DP) problem where we need to determine if the entire string `s` can be matched by the pattern `p`. The pattern can include '.' which matches any single character and '*' which matches zero or more of the preceding element.

# Approach
1. Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `true` since an empty string matches an empty pattern.
3. Initialize the first row for patterns that can match an empty string, i.e., patterns like `a*`, `a*b*`, etc.
4. Iterate over each character of `s` and `p` and fill the `dp` table based on:
   - If the current characters match or the pattern character is '.', copy the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If the pattern character is '*', there are two cases:
     - Consider zero occurrence of the character before '*', i.e., `dp[i][j-2]`.
     - If the preceding character of '*' matches the current character in `s` or is '.', consider one or more occurrences, i.e., `dp[i-1][j]`.
5. Return `dp[m][n]` where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`.

# Explanation
- Initialize the DP table with `false` values.
- Set `dp[0][0]` to `true` since empty pattern matches empty string.
- Handle patterns that can match an empty string by filling the first row of the DP table.
- Iterate over each character in the string and pattern to update the DP table based on the current characters and pattern rules ('.' and '*').
- The result is stored in `dp[m][n]` which tells if the entire string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(m * n)***
  - We iterate through each character of the string `s` and pattern `p` once, resulting in a time complexity of `O(m * n)`.
- Space complexity: ***O(m * n)***
  - We use a 2D DP array to store the results of subproblems.

# Code
```typescript
function isMatch(s: string, p: string): boolean {
    const m = s.length;
    const n = p.length;
    const dp: boolean[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(false));

    dp[0][0] = true;

    // Fill the first row (matches empty string)
    for (let j = 2; j <= n; j += 2) {
        if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2];
        }
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (p[j - 1] === '.' || p[j - 1] === s[i - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else if (p[j - 1] === '*') {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2];
                if (p[j - 2] === '.' || p[j - 2] === s[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
};
