[210. Course Schedule II](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)

# Intuition
To determine the order of courses based on prerequisites, we can model this problem as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each course is a node and each prerequisite is a directed edge. We need to perform a topological sort on this graph to find a valid order of courses. If a cycle exists in the graph, it means it is impossible to complete all courses.

# Approach
1. Build a graph using an adjacency list representation where each course points to the courses that depend on it.
2. Track the in-degree (number of incoming edges) of each course.
3. Initialize a queue with all courses that have an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites).
4. Perform a BFS:
   - Dequeue a course, add it to the result list.
   - Decrease the in-degree of its dependent courses by 1.
   - If the in-degree of a dependent course becomes 0, enqueue it.
5. If the result list contains all the courses, return it as the valid order. If not, return an empty list indicating it's impossible to complete all courses.

# Explanation
1. Constructing the graph and calculating the in-degrees allows us to identify courses without prerequisites.
2. Using a queue for BFS ensures we process courses in the correct order, and adjusting in-degrees dynamically helps us manage dependencies effectively.
3. If a course is enqueued, it means all its prerequisites have been processed, ensuring a valid order.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - Building the graph and calculating in-degrees: O(V + E), where V is the number of courses and E is the number of prerequisites.
  - BFS traversal: O(V + E), as each node and edge is processed once.
  - Overall time complexity: O(V + E)

- Space complexity:
  - Adjacency list and in-degree array: O(V + E)
  - Queue for BFS: O(V)
  - Overall space complexity: O(V + E)

# Code
```TypeScript
function findOrder(numCourses: number, prerequisites: number[][]): number[] {
    const graph: number[][] = Array.from({ length: numCourses }, () => []);
    const inDegree: number[] = Array(numCourses).fill(0);
    const order: number[] = [];
    
    // Build graph and in-degree array
    for (const [course, prereq] of prerequisites) {
        graph[prereq].push(course);
        inDegree[course]++;
    }
    
    // Initialize queue with courses having in-degree 0
    const queue: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // Perform BFS
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift()!;
        order.push(current);
        
        for (const neighbor of graph[current]) {
            inDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) {
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If order contains all courses, return it, otherwise return an empty array
    return order.length === numCourses ? order : [];
}
