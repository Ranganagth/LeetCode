[141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

# Intuition

The problem is to determine whether a linked list has a cycle. A cycle occurs if a node in the linked list is visited more than once while traversing the list. One efficient way to detect this is by using Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm, also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm. The key idea is to use two pointers moving at different speeds: if there is a cycle, the faster-moving pointer will eventually meet the slower-moving pointer.

# Approach

1. **Initial Check**: If the linked list is empty (`head` is null) or has only one node (`head.next` is null), it cannot have a cycle, so return `false`.
2. **Two Pointers**: Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the list.
3. **Traversal**:
   - Move the `slow` pointer by one step (`slow = slow.next`).
   - Move the `fast` pointer by two steps (`fast = fast.next.next`).
   - If at any point, `slow` and `fast` pointers meet, it indicates that there is a cycle in the linked list.
   - If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., `fast` or `fast.next` becomes null), it means there is no cycle.
4. **Return Result**: Return `true` if the pointers meet, otherwise return `false`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, each node is visited at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since no extra space is used except for a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
 *     }
 * }
 */

function hasCycle(head: ListNode | null): boolean {
    if (!head || !head.next) return false;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;

        if (slow === fast) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Check**: We first check if the list is empty or has only one node. If either condition is true, return `false`.
2. **Two Pointers**: We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head of the list.
3. **Traversal**: 
   - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time.
   - The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - If the pointers meet at any node, it means there is a cycle.
   - If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, it means there is no cycle.
4. **Return Result**: The function returns `true` if the pointers meet, otherwise it returns `false`.
