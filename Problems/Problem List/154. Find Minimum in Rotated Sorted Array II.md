[154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

# Intuition

When encountering duplicates, if the middle element is equal to the rightmost element, we can't be certain which half contains the minimum element. In such cases, we can safely reduce the search space by moving the right pointer one step left. This helps in making progress and reduces the size of the problem.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array respectively.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - While `left` is less than `right`:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]`.
       - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, it means the minimum element is in the left half (including `mid`).
         - Update `right = mid`.
       - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, it means the minimum element is in the right half (excluding `mid`).
         - Update `left = mid + 1`.
       - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, it is ambiguous which half contains the minimum. We can safely reduce the search space by decrementing `right`.
         - Update `right = right - 1`.

3. **Termination**:
   - When the loop terminates, `left` will point to the minimum element in the array.
   - Return `nums[left]`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** in the worst case because in the presence of many duplicates, we might end up decrementing `right` almost every time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function findMin(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
            right = mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return nums[left];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: We start with `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end.
- **Binary Search Loop**:
  - Compute `mid` as the midpoint.
  - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]` to determine which half to explore.
  - Adjust `left` and `right` based on comparisons:
    - If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, the minimum is in the left part.
    - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, the minimum is in the right part.
    - If `nums[mid] == nums[right]`, decrement `right` to reduce search space.
- **Termination**: When `left` equals `right`, `left` points to the minimum element.
- **Return Statement**: Return `nums[left]`, which is the minimum element of the array.
