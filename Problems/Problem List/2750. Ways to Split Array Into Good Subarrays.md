[2750. Ways to Split Array Into Good Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-split-array-into-good-subarrays/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of counting the number of ways to split the binary array `nums` into good subarrays, we need to understand the following:

1. **Good Subarray**: A subarray that contains exactly one element with the value 1.
2. **Subarray Splitting**: We need to find ways to split the array such that each subarray contains exactly one `1`.

# Approach

1. **Identify Positions of `1`s**:
   - Traverse the array to collect the positions (indices) of all the `1`s.
   - This is essential because each good subarray must contain exactly one `1`.

2. **Count Splits Based on Gaps Between `1`s**:
   - Once we have the indices of all `1`s, the number of ways to split the array between two consecutive `1`s is determined by the number of zeros (or any other elements) between them.
   - Specifically, if the distance between two `1`s at indices `i` and `j` is `d` (i.e., there are `d - 1` elements between them), then there are exactly `d` ways to split the array between these two `1`s.
   - For example, for `nums = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]`, the distance between the two `1`s is `4 - 1 = 3`, and thus, there are `3` ways to split.

3. **Calculate Total Splits**:
   - Multiply the number of ways to split for each pair of consecutive `1`s to get the total number of good subarrays.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, we use modulo *10⁹ + 7* to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the array, as we traverse the array a few times linearly.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, where *m* is the number of `1`s in the array (to store their indices).

# Code
```typescript
function countGoodSubarrays(nums: number[]): number {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = nums.length;
    let positions = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            positions.push(i);
        }
    }

    if (positions.length <= 1) {
        return positions.length;
    }

    let totalWays = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < positions.length; i++) {
        totalWays = (totalWays * (positions[i] - positions[i - 1])) % MOD;
    }

    return totalWays;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Collect Positions**:
   - We iterate through `nums` and collect indices where the value is `1`.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no `1`s or only one `1`, the number of good subarrays is simply the count of `1`s.
3. **Calculate Splits**:
   - For each pair of consecutive `1`s, we calculate the number of possible splits and multiply them together.
4. **Return Result**:
   - The final result is the product of splits for all pairs of consecutive `1`s, taken modulo *10⁹ + 7*.
