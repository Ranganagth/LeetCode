[209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

# Intuition
To find the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to a given target, we can use the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique. This technique allows us to dynamically adjust the window size while keeping track of the sum, thereby efficiently finding the minimal subarray length.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables:** Start with two pointers (`left` and `right`) at the beginning of the array and a variable to keep track of the current sum within the window. Also, maintain a variable to store the minimal length found.
2. **Expand Window:** Move the `right` pointer to expand the window and add `nums[right]` to the current sum.
3. **Shrink Window:** If the current sum is greater than or equal to the target, try to shrink the window from the left by moving the `left` pointer to the right and subtracting `nums[left]` from the current sum. Update the minimal length during this process.
4. **Continue Until End:** Repeat the steps until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)*** because each element is processed at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)*** since no extra space is used that scales with input size.

# Code
```typescript
function minSubArrayLen(target: number, nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        sum += nums[right];

        while (sum >= target) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
            sum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? 0 : minLength;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:** Set `left` to 0, `sum` to 0, and `minLength` to Infinity.
2. **Expand Window:** Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer, adding `nums[right]` to `sum`.
3. **Check and Shrink:** If `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, update `minLength` and shrink the window by incrementing `left` until `sum` is less than `target`.
4. **Result:** If `minLength` remains Infinity, it means no valid subarray was found, so return 0. Otherwise, return `minLength`.
