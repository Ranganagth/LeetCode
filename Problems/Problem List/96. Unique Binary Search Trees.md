[96. Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

# Intuition
The number of unique BSTs with `n` nodes can be calculated using dynamic programming. For each node `i` from 1 to `n`, if `i` is chosen as the root:
- The left subtree will consist of nodes from 1 to `i-1`.
- The right subtree will consist of nodes from `i+1` to `n`.

The total number of unique BSTs with `n` nodes is the sum of all possible combinations of left and right subtrees for each possible root.

## Catalan Number Formula 
The nth Catalan number C(n) can be calculated using the formula: 
C(n) = sum(C(i) * C(n-i-1)) for i from 0 to n-1 
where C(0) = 1 and C(1) = 1.

# Approach
1. Initialize an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique BSTs with `i` nodes.
2. Set `dp[0] = 1` (empty tree) and `dp[1] = 1` (one single node tree).
3. Use the Catalan number formula to fill the `dp` array for all values from 2 to `n`.
4. Return `dp[n]` as the result.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)***, due to the nested loops required to compute the number of trees for each `i`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array storing results for each count of nodes from 0 to `n`.

# Code
```typescript
function numTrees(n: number): number {
    const dp: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - j - 1];
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: `dp` array is initialized with `n+1` elements, all set to 0 initially. `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are set to 1 because there is exactly one way to arrange zero or one node.
2. **Filling dp Array**: For each `i` from 2 to `n`, we compute `dp[i]` by summing up all combinations of left and right subtrees for each possible root position `j`.
3. **Returning Result**: Finally, `dp[n]` contains the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with `n` nodes.
