[99. Recover Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-binary-search-tree/)

# Intuition

A BST has the property that an in-order traversal yields the nodes in sorted order. If two nodes are swapped, this property will be violated. By performing an in-order traversal, we can identify the two nodes that are out of order.

# Approach

1. **Morris In-order Traversal**: This method allows us to perform the in-order traversal of the tree without using extra space. It leverages the threaded binary tree concept.
2. **Identify Swapped Nodes**: During the in-order traversal, we look for the two nodes where the order property is violated.
3. **Swap Values**: Once the two nodes are identified, we simply swap their values to restore the BST property.

### Steps for Morris In-order Traversal

1. Initialize pointers `first`, `second`, `prev`, and `current`.
2. Traverse the tree using Morris Traversal:
   - If the left child is `null`, visit the node and move to the right child.
   - If the left child is not `null`, find the rightmost node in the left subtree (predecessor). Make the current node the right child of the predecessor.
   - If the rightmost node in the left subtree is already pointing to the current node, it means we have already visited the left subtree, so visit the current node and remove the thread.
3. During traversal, keep track of the previous node (`prev`). When the current node's value is less than the previous node's value, we have found a breach:
   - The first breach identifies the `first` node (`prev`) and the `second` node (`current`).
   - The second breach identifies the `second` node (`current`).

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we traverse all nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** due to Morris Traversal.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function recoverTree(root: TreeNode | null): void {
    let first: TreeNode | null = null;
    let second: TreeNode | null = null;
    let prev: TreeNode | null = null;
    let current: TreeNode | null = root;

    while (current !== null) {
        if (current.left === null) {
            if (prev !== null && current.val < prev.val) {
                if (first === null) {
                    first = prev;
                }
                second = current;
            }
            prev = current;
            current = current.right;
        } else {
            let pre: TreeNode = current.left;
            while (pre.right !== null && pre.right !== current) {
                pre = pre.right;
            }
            if (pre.right === null) {
                pre.right = current;
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                pre.right = null;
                if (prev !== null && current.val < prev.val) {
                    if (first === null) {
                        first = prev;
                    }
                    second = current;
                }
                prev = current;
                current = current.right;
            }
        }
    }

    if (first !== null && second !== null) {
        let temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
    }
};
