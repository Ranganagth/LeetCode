[240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)

# Intuition

Given the properties of the matrix:

- Rows are sorted in ascending order.
- Columns are sorted in ascending order.

We need to efficiently determine whether a given target value exists in the matrix.
# Approach:

1. **Start at the Top-Right Corner**: Start searching from the top-right corner of the matrix.
   - If the target is greater than the current element, it cannot be in the current row (because elements to the left are smaller). Move down to the next row.
   - If the target is less than the current element, it cannot be in the current column (because elements below are larger). Move left to the previous column.
   - If the target equals the current element, return true.
   
2. **Repeat Until Found or Out of Bounds**: Continue adjusting the row or column until the target is found or the search moves out of the matrix boundaries.

3. **Termination**: If the entire search space is exhausted and the target is not found, return false.

This method ensures that each movement either decreases the possible rows or columns where the target could be, leading to an efficient search.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m + n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. In the worst case, we may need to traverse across the entire width or height of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function searchMatrix(matrix: number[][], target: number): boolean {
    if (matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    let row = 0;
    let col = matrix[0].length - 1;
    
    while (row < matrix.length && col >= 0) {
        if (matrix[row][col] === target) {
            return true;
        } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
            row++;
        } else {
            col--;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};

```

### Explanation:

- **Initialization**: Start from the top-right corner of the matrix (`row = 0`, `col = matrix[0].length - 1`).
- **Searching**: Compare the target with the current element:
  - If target is found, return `true`.
  - If target is greater, move down to the next row (`row++`).
  - If target is smaller, move left to the previous column (`col--`).
- **Termination**: If `row` exceeds `matrix.length - 1` or `col` becomes less than `0`, return `false`.
