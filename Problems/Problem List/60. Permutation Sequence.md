[60. Permutation Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)

# Intuition
To find the k-th permutation sequence of the set [1, 2, ..., n], we can leverage the properties of permutations and factorials. The idea is to determine the correct digit for each position in the sequence by using the factorial of the remaining digits.

# Approach
1. **Factorials and Groups**: The sequence of permutations can be divided into blocks where each block represents permutations starting with a specific digit. For example, with `n=4`, the first 6 permutations (1 to 6) start with '1', the next 6 permutations (7 to 12) start with '2', and so on.
2. **Determine Position**: By calculating the size of each block (`(n-1)!`), we can determine which digit should be at the current position of the sequence. We use integer division and modulus operations to navigate through the blocks.
3. **Update and Recurse**: After determining the digit for the current position, we update `k` to find the next digit in the reduced problem size (`n-1`).

# Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: Generate a list of numbers from 1 to n and compute factorials for numbers up to `n-1`.
2. **Digit Selection**: For each position in the sequence:
   - Determine the index of the digit in the current list by dividing `k` by the factorial of the remaining positions.
   - Update `k` to the new index for the subsequent positions.
3. **Result Construction**: Build the resulting permutation string by selecting digits based on the computed indices.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, as we iterate through the digits from 1 to n.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(n)***, to store the list of numbers and the result.

# Code
```typescript
function getPermutation(n: number, k: number): string {
    const factorial = (num: number): number => {
        return num <= 1 ? 1 : num * factorial(num - 1);
    }

    let numbers = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        numbers.push(i);
    }

    k--;
    let result = '';

    for (let i = n; i > 0; i--) {
        const fact = factorial(i - 1);
        const index = Math.floor(k / fact);
        result += numbers[index];
        numbers.splice(index, 1);
        k %= fact;
    }

    return result;
};

```
