[229. Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/)

# Intuition

According to the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**, for any number `n`, **there can be at most two elements** that occur more than `n / 3` times.

This is because:
* If there were three or more such elements, they would appear more than `n/3` times each.
* That would total to more than `n`, which is impossible.

# Approach

1. **Phase 1: Find Candidates**
   * Use a modified Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.
   * Maintain two potential candidates and their counts (`candidate1`, `candidate2`, `count1`, `count2`).

2. **Phase 2: Validate Candidates**
   * After finding candidates, count their actual frequencies in the array.
   * Include them in the result if they appear more than `n / 3` times.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` — single pass to find candidates, and another to validate.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — constant extra space (excluding output list).

# Code

```typescript
function majorityElement(nums: number[]): number[] {
    let candidate1: number | null = null, count1 = 0;
    let candidate2: number | null = null, count2 = 0;

    // Phase 1: Find possible candidates
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (num === candidate1) {
            count1++;
        } else if (num === candidate2) {
            count2++;
        } else if (count1 === 0) {
            candidate1 = num;
            count1 = 1;
        } else if (count2 === 0) {
            candidate2 = num;
            count2 = 1;
        } else {
            count1--;
            count2--;
        }
    }

    // Phase 2: Verify candidates
    count1 = count2 = 0;
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (num === candidate1) count1++;
        else if (num === candidate2) count2++;
    }

    const result: number[] = [];
    const n = nums.length;
    if (count1 > Math.floor(n / 3)) result.push(candidate1!);
    if (count2 > Math.floor(n / 3)) result.push(candidate2!);

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### Example 1:

* Input: `[3, 2, 3]`, `n = 3`, $⌊n/3⌋$ = 1
* Candidates: `3` (appears 2 times)
* Output: `[3]`

#### Example 2:

* Input: `[1]`, `n = 1`, $⌊n/3⌋$ = 0
* Output: `[1]` (since 1 > 0)

#### Example 3:

* Input: `[1, 2]`, `n = 2`, $⌊n/3⌋$ = 0
* Output: `[1, 2]` (both appear more than 0 times)
