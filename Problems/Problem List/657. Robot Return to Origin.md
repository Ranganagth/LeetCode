[657. Robot Return to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/)

# Intuition:

- The robot's movement can be tracked by counting how many steps it takes in each direction:
  - 'R' increases the x-coordinate by 1 (moves right).
  - 'L' decreases the x-coordinate by 1 (moves left).
  - 'U' increases the y-coordinate by 1 (moves up).
  - 'D' decreases the y-coordinate by 1 (moves down).

- To return to the origin `(0, 0)`, the number of right moves should equal the number of left moves, and the number of up moves should equal the number of down moves.

# Approach:

1. **Track Position**:
   - Start with an initial position `(0, 0)`.
   - Iterate over each move in the string and adjust the position accordingly.

2. **Final Position**:
   - After processing all moves, check if the position is back at `(0, 0)`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - If the final position is `(0, 0)`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the moves string. We process each move exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only need a few variables to track the position.

# Code:

```typescript
function judgeCircle(moves: string): boolean {
    let x = 0;
    let y = 0;
    
    for (let move of moves) {
        if (move === 'R') {
            x += 1;
        } else if (move === 'L') {
            x -= 1;
        } else if (move === 'U') {
            y += 1;
        } else if (move === 'D') {
            y -= 1;
        }
    }
    
    return x === 0 && y === 0;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(judgeCircle("UD")); // Output: true
console.log(judgeCircle("LL")); // Output: false
```

### Explanation with Examples:

1. **Example 1**: 
   - Input: `moves = "UD"`
   - Moves: 
     - 'U' increases y by 1: `(0, 1)`
     - 'D' decreases y by 1: `(0, 0)`
   - Final Position: `(0, 0)` — The robot returns to the origin, so return `true`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `moves = "LL"`
   - Moves:
     - 'L' decreases x by 1: `(-1, 0)`
     - 'L' decreases x by 1 again: `(-2, 0)`
   - Final Position: `(-2, 0)` — The robot is not at the origin, so return `false`.
