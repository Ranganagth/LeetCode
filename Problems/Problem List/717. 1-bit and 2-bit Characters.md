[717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/)

# Intuition
To determine if the last character in a given binary array `bits` must be a one-bit character, we need to decode the sequence and check the last bit's validity. The two special characters are:
- One-bit character: represented by `0`
- Two-bit character: represented by `10` or `11`

# Approach
We need to decode the bits starting from the beginning:
1. Traverse the array from the start to the end.
2. If you encounter a `0`, it could be a one-bit character, so you move to the next bit.
3. If you encounter a `1`, it means it must be the start of a two-bit character (`10` or `11`), so you skip the next bit by incrementing the index by 2.
4. At the end of the traversal, check if the last bit is reached after decoding the sequence. If yes, it indicates the last bit must be a one-bit character.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** since we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function isOneBitCharacter(bits: number[]): boolean {
    let i = 0;
    const n = bits.length;
    
    while (i < n - 1) {
        if (bits[i] === 1) {
            i += 2;
        } else {
            i += 1;
        }
    }
    
    return i === n - 1;
};

```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Start with an index `i = 0`.
- **Traversal**: Iterate through the array until `i` is less than `n - 1` (second last index).
  - If the current bit is `1`, skip the next bit by incrementing `i` by 2.
  - If the current bit is `0`, move to the next bit by incrementing `i` by 1.
- **Final Check**: After the loop, check if `i` is exactly `n - 1`, which means we correctly decoded the sequence and ended at the last bit as a one-bit character. If so, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.
