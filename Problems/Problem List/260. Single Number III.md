[260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

### Problem: Find the Two Single Numbers

You're given an array `nums` in which:
* Every number appears exactly twice **except** for **two unique numbers** that appear once.

You need to return those two unique numbers in **any order**.

**Constraints**:
* Linear time `O(n)`
* Constant extra space `O(1)`

---

# Intuition

This is a variation of the classic **"single number using XOR"** problem.

We use **bitwise XOR** properties:
* `a ^ a = 0`
* `a ^ 0 = a`
* XOR is **commutative** and **associative**

If we XOR **all** elements in the array, duplicates cancel out:
* Result will be: `a ^ b` where `a` and `b` are the two unique numbers

Now the key trick is:
* In `a ^ b`, at least one bit must be set (because `a ≠ b`)
* That set bit can help us **partition** the array into two groups:
  * Group 1: numbers with that bit set
  * Group 2: numbers with that bit not set

In each group:
* One of `a` or `b` will fall into each
* All duplicates will still cancel out using XOR

---

# Approach

1. XOR all elements to get `xor = a ^ b`
2. Find the **rightmost set bit** in `xor`: `diffBit = xor & -xor`
3. Partition numbers into two groups based on `diffBit` and XOR separately
4. The result of each group is one of the unique numbers

---
# Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n)` (single pass to XOR, one more pass to group and XOR)
* **Space**: `O(1)` (only a few variables used)

---
# Code

```ts
function singleNumber(nums: number[]): number[] {
    let xor = 0;

    // Step 1: XOR all numbers to get a ^ b
    for (let num of nums) {
        xor ^= num;
    }

    // Step 2: Find rightmost set bit
    let diffBit = xor & -xor;

    // Step 3: Split into two groups and XOR separately
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if ((num & diffBit) === 0) {
            x ^= num; // Group with bit not set
        } else {
            y ^= num; // Group with bit set
        }
    }

    return [x, y];
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

**Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5]`

* Step 1: XOR all
  `1 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 5 = (1^1) ^ (2^2) ^ (3^5) = 0 ^ 0 ^ 6 = 6`

* Step 2: `diffBit = 6 & -6 = 2` (rightmost set bit is at position 1)

* Step 3: Group by bit 1

  * Group 1 (`bit unset`): 1, 1, 5 → `1^1^5 = 5`
  * Group 2 (`bit set`): 2, 2, 3 → `2^2^3 = 3`

**Output**: `[3, 5]`

### Summary

This elegant XOR-based approach leverages bitwise tricks to meet both **linear runtime** and **constant space** constraints. It efficiently isolates the two unique numbers among duplicates using a divide-by-bit approach.
