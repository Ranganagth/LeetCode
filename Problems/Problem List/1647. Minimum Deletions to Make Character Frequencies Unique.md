[1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-character-frequencies-unique/)

# Intuition
The problem requires making a string "good" by ensuring no two different characters have the same frequency. To achieve this, we need to minimize the number of deletions necessary. We can follow these steps:
1. Count the frequency of each character.
2. Use a set to track used frequencies to ensure uniqueness.
3. For each frequency, if it’s already used, decrement it until it becomes unique or zero (delete the entire character if needed).

# Approach
1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hashmap to count the frequency of each character.
2. **Track Used Frequencies**: Use a set to track the frequencies that have been used.
3. **Adjust Frequencies**: Iterate through the character frequencies. If a frequency is already used, decrement it until it becomes unique or reaches zero.
4. **Count Deletions**: Track the number of deletions needed to adjust the frequencies.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + k²)***, where *n* is the length of the string and *k* is the number of unique frequencies (in the worst case, decrementing a frequency from *k* to 0 can take *k* operations, repeated for each unique frequency).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the frequency counts and used frequencies.

# Code

```typescript
function minDeletions(s: string): number {
    const charFrequency = new Map<string, number>();

    for (const char of s) {
        charFrequency.set(char, (charFrequency.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const usedFrequencies = new Set<number>();
    let deletions = 0;

    for (const [char, freq] of charFrequency) {
        let currentFreq = freq;

        while (currentFreq > 0 && usedFrequencies.has(currentFreq)) {
            currentFreq--;
            deletions++;
        }

        if (currentFreq > 0) {
            usedFrequencies.add(currentFreq);
        }
    }

    return deletions;
};

```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Count Frequencies**: 
   - `charFrequency` is a map storing the frequency of each character.
2. **Track Used Frequencies**:
   - `usedFrequencies` is a set storing frequencies that have been used.
3. **Adjust Frequencies**:
   - Iterate through each character's frequency.
   - While the frequency is already in `usedFrequencies`, decrement it and increment the deletion count.
   - Add the adjusted frequency to `usedFrequencies` if it’s greater than zero.
4. **Return Result**: 
   - Finally, return the total number of deletions needed.
