[332. Reconstruct Itinerary](https://leetcode.com/problems/reconstruct-itinerary/)

### Problem Summary

You're given a list of flight tickets represented as pairs of departure and arrival airports. All trips start from `"JFK"`. You must **reconstruct an itinerary** that:

1. Uses all the tickets exactly once.
2. Starts at `"JFK"`.
3. If multiple itineraries are possible, return the **lexicographically smallest** one.

---

# Intuition

This is a classic **Eulerian path** problem with lexical ordering constraints.

Think of airports as **graph nodes** and tickets as **directed edges**. You need to:
* Visit all edges **exactly once** (Eulerian path).
* Prefer lexicographically smaller destinations when multiple options exist.

To achieve this, we'll use **Hierholzer’s algorithm**, modified to pick **lex smallest edges first** using **priority queues** (min-heaps).

---

# Approach

1. **Build an adjacency list** using a min-heap (priority queue) for each airport to store destinations in sorted order.
2. Use **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:

   * Always pick the smallest destination from the current airport.
   * When no more tickets are available from the current node, prepend the airport to the itinerary.
3. Return the reversed postorder traversal as the result.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(E log E)`

  * Each edge (ticket) is inserted and popped from a priority queue.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(E + V)`

  * For adjacency list and result path. `E` is number of tickets, `V` is number of unique airports.

# Code

```ts
function findItinerary(tickets: string[][]): string[] {
    const adj: Record<string, string[]> = {};

    // Build graph with min-heaps (use arrays and sort later for TS simplicity)
    for (const [from, to] of tickets) {
        if (!adj[from]) adj[from] = [];
        adj[from].push(to);
    }

    // Sort destinations for each node in lexical order
    for (const from in adj) {
        adj[from].sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    }

    const itinerary: string[] = [];

    function dfs(curr: string) {
        const dests = adj[curr] || [];
        while (dests.length > 0) {
            const next = dests.shift()!;
            dfs(next);
        }
        itinerary.unshift(curr);
    }

    dfs("JFK");

    return itinerary;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

**Input:**
`tickets = [["MUC","LHR"],["JFK","MUC"],["SFO","SJC"],["LHR","SFO"]]`

**Steps:**

* Graph:

  * JFK → \[MUC]
  * MUC → \[LHR]
  * LHR → \[SFO]
  * SFO → \[SJC]
* DFS starts from JFK:

  * JFK → MUC → LHR → SFO → SJC

**Output:**
`["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]`

---

#### Example 2:

**Input:**
`tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`

**Lexical Graph:**

* JFK → \[ATL, SFO]
* SFO → \[ATL]
* ATL → \[JFK, SFO]

Prefer ATL over SFO from JFK due to lexical order.

**Path:**
JFK → ATL → JFK → SFO → ATL → SFO

**Output:**
`["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]`

---

### Summary

* Modeled as a **directed graph** and solved with **DFS + min-heap sorting**.
* Ensured **all tickets used once**.
* Guaranteed **lex smallest** itinerary by always choosing the smallest available destination.
