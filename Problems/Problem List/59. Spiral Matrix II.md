[59. Spiral Matrix II](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-ii/)

# Intuition
To generate an n × n matrix filled with elements from 1 to `n²`  in spiral order, we can use a systematic approach that involves four major steps:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the matrix with zeros and define the boundaries of the spiral (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).

2. **Filling the Spiral**: Traverse the matrix in a spiral order, filling each position with the next number from 1 to n².

3. **Updating Boundaries**: After filling each row or column in the spiral, adjust the boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to reflect the remaining matrix.

4. **Termination**: The process terminates when all elements of the matrix are filled.

# Approach

1. **Initialize the Matrix**:
   - Create an `n × n`  matrix filled with zeros.
   - Initialize `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` variables to keep track of the boundaries of the spiral.

2. **Fill the Spiral**:
   - Use a while loop that continues until all elements in the matrix are filled (`current <= n * n`).
   - Traverse from left to right along the `top` row.
   - Traverse from top to bottom along the `right` column.
   - Traverse from right to left along the `bottom` row (if `top < bottom`).
   - Traverse from bottom to top along the `left` column (if `left < right`).

3. **Update Boundaries**:
   - After completing each direction, adjust the corresponding boundary (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) to ensure we do not overlap already filled positions.

4. **Return the Matrix**:
   - Once the while loop terminates, return the generated matrix.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n²)***. We need to fill each cell of the matrix exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)***. We are using extra space to store the matrix.

# Code
```typescript
function generateMatrix(n: number): number[][] {
    const matrix: number[][] = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(0));
    
    let top = 0, bottom = n - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    let current = 1;
    
    while (current <= n * n) {
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = current++;
        }
        top++;
        
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = current++;
        }
        right--;
        
        for (let i = right; i >= left; i--) {
            matrix[bottom][i] = current++;
        }
        bottom--;
        
        for (let i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
            matrix[i][left] = current++;
        }
        left++;
    }
    
    return matrix;
};
