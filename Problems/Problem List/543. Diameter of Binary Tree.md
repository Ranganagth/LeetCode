[543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)


# Intuition

The diameter of the tree can be computed by considering the longest path that goes through each node. For a given node, this path is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees. By computing this for each node and keeping track of the maximum value, we can determine the diameter of the tree.

# Approach

1. Use a helper function to calculate the height of the tree.
2. During the height calculation, also compute the diameter by keeping track of the maximum value of the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees for each node.
3. The height of a node is the maximum height of its left and right subtrees plus one.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(N)***, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(H)***, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used in the DFS approach. In the worst case, this can be `O(N)` for a skewed tree.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function diameterOfBinaryTree(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    let diameter = 0;

    function height(node: TreeNode | null): number {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        const leftHeight = height(node.left);
        const rightHeight = height(node.right);
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }

    height(root);
    return diameter;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**: A class to represent each node of the binary tree.
2. **diameterOfBinaryTree Function**: This function initializes a `diameter` variable to keep track of the maximum diameter found.
3. **height Function**: A recursive function that calculates the height of a node and updates the `diameter`. The height of a node is the maximum height of its left and right subtrees plus one. While calculating the height, it also updates the diameter with the sum of the left and right heights.
4. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates how to create a tree and calculate its diameter.
