[1822. Sign of the Product of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/sign-of-the-product-of-an-array/)

# Intuition:
Instead of calculating the actual product of the array (which might be computationally expensive or result in overflow for large arrays), we can determine the sign of the product by observing the properties:
- If any element is `0`, the product is `0`.
- If the count of negative numbers in the array is even, the product is positive.
- If the count of negative numbers is odd, the product is negative.

# Approach:
1. Initialize a counter for negative numbers.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If any element is `0`, return `0` immediately.
   - If an element is negative, increment the negative counter.
3. After iterating, determine the sign based on the negative counter:
   - If the count of negatives is even, return `1`.
   - If the count of negatives is odd, return `-1`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use only a few variables for counting.

# Code:

```typescript
function arraySign(nums: number[]): number {
    let negativeCount = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (num < 0) {
            negativeCount++;
        }
    }

    return negativeCount % 2 === 0 ? 1 : -1;
};

```

### Examples:

1. **Input**: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]`
   - **Output**: `1`
   - **Explanation**: There are 4 negative numbers, so the product is positive.

2. **Input**: `nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]`
   - **Output**: `0`
   - **Explanation**: Since one element is `0`, the product is `0`.

3. **Input**: `nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]`
   - **Output**: `-1`
   - **Explanation**: There are 3 negative numbers, so the product is negative.
