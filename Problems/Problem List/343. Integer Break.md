[343. Integer Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/)

# Intuition
The reason for using as many 3's as possible is because the exponential function grows fastest when the base is *e ≈ 2.718*. For integer values, splitting *n* into parts of 3 and 2 maximizes the product. 

- If you split *n* into parts that include 4 or higher, you can replace them with smaller parts (3's and 2's) to get a higher product.
- If there is a remainder when *n* is divided by 3, it can be 0, 1, or 2. We handle these cases separately:
  - Remainder 0: Just use all 3's.
  - Remainder 1: Use one less 3 and add a 4 instead (since *3 + 1 = 4* and *3 × 1 < 4* ).
  - Remainder 2: Just add a 2 at the end (since *3 × 2 > 5* ).

# Approach
1. If *n* is 2 or 3, handle these as special cases since they can't be split into parts that are all greater than or equal to 2.
2. For larger *n*:
   - Divide *n* by 3 and check the remainder.
   - Based on the remainder, form the product using the maximum number of 3's and adjust the last few parts.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because the solution involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function integerBreak(n: number): number {
    if (n <= 3) return n - 1;

    const quotient = Math.floor(n / 3);
    const remainder = n % 3;

    if (remainder === 0) {
        return Math.pow(3, quotient);
    } else if (remainder === 1) {
        return Math.pow(3, quotient - 1) * 4;
    } else {
        return Math.pow(3, quotient) * 2;
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Base cases**:
   - If *n* is 2, return 1 because *1 + 1 = 2* and *1 × 1 = 1*.
   - If *n* is 3, return 2 because *2 + 1 = 3* and *2 × 1 = 2* .

2. **General cases**:
   - Calculate the quotient and remainder when \( n \) is divided by 3.
   - If the remainder is 0, return *3^(quotient)*.
   - If the remainder is 1, adjust by using one less 3 and adding a 4.
   - If the remainder is 2, multiply the product of 3's by 2.
