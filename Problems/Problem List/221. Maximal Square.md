[221. Maximal Square](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Here's the intuition behind the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - We define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will represent the size of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at the cell `(i, j)` in the original matrix.
   - For example, `dp[2][2]` will represent the size of the largest square ending at the cell `(2, 2)` in the matrix.

2. **State Transition**:
   - If `matrix[i][j]` is '1' (meaning there is a square that ends at `(i, j)`), then `dp[i][j]` depends on `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - Specifically, `dp[i][j]` is determined by taking the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]`, and adding 1 to it (because you can extend the square that ends at `(i-1, j-1)` to `(i, j)`).

3. **Base Case**:
   - If `matrix[i][j]` is '0', then `dp[i][j]` should be 0 because no square can end at a cell with '0'.

4. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array, squared. This is because the `dp` array stores the size of the largest square ending at each cell, and we need to return the area of the largest square.

# Approach

1. **Initialize the DP Array**:
   - Create a 2D `dp` array of the same size as the `matrix`.
   - Initialize the first row and first column of `dp` based on whether `matrix[i][j]` is '1' or '0'.

2. **Fill the DP Array**:
   - Iterate through the matrix starting from `(1, 1)` to `(m-1, n-1)`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j]` is '1', update `dp[i][j]` using the relation:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     ```

3. **Compute the Result**:
   - Track the maximum value in the `dp` array and return its square as the result.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we traverse the entire matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** due to the extra space used by the `dp` array.

# Code
```typescript
function maximalSquare(matrix: string[][]): number {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    let maxSquareLen = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = Number(matrix[i][0]);
        maxSquareLen = Math.max(maxSquareLen, dp[i][0]);
    }
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = Number(matrix[0][j]);
        maxSquareLen = Math.max(maxSquareLen, dp[0][j]);
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === '1') {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                maxSquareLen = Math.max(maxSquareLen, dp[i][j]);
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxSquareLen * maxSquareLen;
};

```
