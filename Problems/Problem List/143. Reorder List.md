[143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

# Intuition

To reorder a linked list as described, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the middle of the linked list**: Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the list.
2. **Reverse the second half of the list**: Reverse the nodes after the middle node.
3. **Merge the two halves**: Merge the first half and the reversed second half alternately.

# Approach

1. **Find the Middle**: Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, to find the middle of the list. `slow` moves one step at a time, and `fast` moves two steps at a time. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.
2. **Reverse the Second Half**: Reverse the list starting from the node after the middle node.
3. **Merge the Halves**: Alternately merge nodes from the first half and the reversed second half.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list a few times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are not using any extra space except for a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     val: number
 *     next: ListNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
 *         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
 *     }
 * }
 */

function reorderList(head: ListNode | null): void {
    if (!head || !head.next) return;

    let slow: ListNode | null = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = head;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        slow = slow!.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    let prev: ListNode | null = null;
    let curr: ListNode | null = slow;
    let next: ListNode | null = null;

    while (curr) {
        next = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }

    let firstHalf: ListNode | null = head;
    let secondHalf: ListNode | null = prev;

    while (secondHalf!.next) {
        next = firstHalf!.next;
        firstHalf!.next = secondHalf;
        firstHalf = next;

        next = secondHalf!.next;
        secondHalf!.next = firstHalf;
        secondHalf = next;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Middle**: We use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list. `slow` moves one step, and `fast` moves two steps. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.

2. **Reversing the Second Half**: Starting from the middle, we reverse the second half of the linked list. We use three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next` to reverse the links.

3. **Merging the Halves**: Finally, we merge the first half and the reversed second half. We use two pointers, one for each half, and alternately connect nodes from each half.
