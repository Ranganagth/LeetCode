[509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

# Intuition

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
- *F(0) = 0*
- *F(1) = 1*
- For *n > 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)*

Using this definition, we can compute *F(n)* iteratively by starting from the base cases and building up to the desired *n*.

# Approach

We will use an iterative approach to compute the Fibonacci number:
1. Initialize two variables to store the previous two Fibonacci numbers, starting with *F(0)* and *F(1)*.
2. Use a loop to compute the next Fibonacci number by summing the previous two numbers.
3. Update the two variables to move one step forward in the sequence.
4. Continue this until we reach *n*.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, since we need to compute each Fibonacci number up to *n* exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are only using a fixed amount of space to store the last two Fibonacci numbers.

# Code
```typescript
function fib(n: number): number {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1;

    let prev1 = 0;
    let prev2 = 1;
    let current = 0;

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        current = prev1 + prev2;
        prev1 = prev2;
        prev2 = current;
    }

    return current;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases**: If *n* is 0 or 1, we directly return 0 or 1, respectively.
2. **Iterative Computation**:
   - We initialize `prev1` and `prev2` to 0 and 1, which correspond to *F(0)* and *F(1)*.
   - For each subsequent number up to *n*, we compute the current Fibonacci number as the sum of the previous two.
   - We then update `prev1` to be `prev2` and `prev2` to be `current`, effectively moving our window forward by one position in the sequence.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the computed Fibonacci number for *n*.
