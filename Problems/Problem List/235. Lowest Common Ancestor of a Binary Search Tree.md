[235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

# Intuition

A BST has the property:
* For any node `n`, all values in the left subtree `< n.val`
* All values in the right subtree `> n.val`

So, the **LCA** is the first node in the tree where `p` and `q` go in **opposite directions** or match the current node.

# Approach

1. Start from the root node.
2. If both `p` and `q` are **less than** the current node, LCA must be in the **left subtree**.
3. If both are **greater than** the current node, LCA is in the **right subtree**.
4. If one is on the left and one is on the right (or one matches the current node), **this node is the LCA**.

This uses BST properties, making it very efficient.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: O(h), where `h` is the height of the BST (O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for skewed).
* **Space**: O(1) for iterative solution (or O(h) for recursive due to call stack).

# Code

```typescript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode | null, p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
    while (root !== null) {
        if (p.val < root.val && q.val < root.val) {
            root = root.left;
        } else if (p.val > root.val && q.val > root.val) {
            root = root.right;
        } else {
            return root; // Split point, this is the LCA
        }
    }
    return null;
};
```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:
BST: `[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]`,
`p = 2`, `q = 8`

**Step-by-step**:

* Start at root = 6
* 2 < 6 and 8 > 6 → different directions
  **LCA is 6**

#### Example 2:

**Input**: `p = 2`, `q = 4`

* Start at root = 6
* Both < 6 → go left to 2
* 2 == p → current node is one of them
  **LCA is 2**

### Summary:

This solution leverages the BST property to efficiently find the LCA without needing to store paths or parent pointers, making it optimal in both time and space for this problem.
