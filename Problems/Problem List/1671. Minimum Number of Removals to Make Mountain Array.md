[1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-removals-to-make-mountain-array/)

# Intuition

To transform an array into a mountain array by removing the minimum number of elements, we can think of it as finding the longest bitonic subsequence in the array. A bitonic subsequence first increases and then decreases. 

The key steps involve finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) for each element. The peak element of the mountain must be part of both an increasing and a decreasing sequence.

# Approach

1. **Calculate LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence)**:
   - For each element, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at that element.
   
2. **Calculate LDS (Longest Decreasing Subsequence)**:
   - For each element, compute the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at that element.
   
3. **Combine LIS and LDS**:
   - For each element, check if it can be a peak (both LIS and LDS lengths should be greater than 1).
   - Calculate the combined length of the bitonic subsequence at that peak.

4. **Calculate the Minimum Removals**:
   - The minimum elements to remove will be the total length of the array minus the length of the longest valid bitonic subsequence.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)*** because we use nested loops to calculate LIS and LDS for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing LIS and LDS arrays.

# Code
```typescript
function minimumMountainRemovals(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    const lis = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const lds = new Array(n).fill(1);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                lis[i] = Math.max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                lds[i] = Math.max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    let maxLength = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
        }
    }
    
    return n - maxLength;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two arrays `lis` and `lds` are initialized to store the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences, respectively.
   
2. **Compute LIS**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, compute the LIS ending at that element by comparing it with all previous elements.
   
3. **Compute LDS**:
   - Similarly, for each element `nums[i]`, compute the LDS starting at that element by comparing it with all subsequent elements.
   
4. **Combine LIS and LDS**:
   - For each element, check if it can be a peak by ensuring both `lis[i]` and `lds[i]` are greater than 1.
   - Calculate the length of the bitonic subsequence at that peak and keep track of the maximum length.
   
5. **Result Calculation**:
   - The minimum number of removals is the total length of the array minus the length of the longest valid bitonic subsequence.
