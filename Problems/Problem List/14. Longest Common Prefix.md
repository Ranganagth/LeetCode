[14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

# Intuition
To find the longest common prefix among an array of strings, the simplest approach is to compare characters of each string at the same position until a mismatch is found. If no common prefix exists, return an empty string.

# Approach
1. Check if the input array is empty. If it is, return an empty string.
2. Initialize the prefix as the first string in the array.
3. Iterate through the rest of the strings in the array:
   - For each string, compare characters with the current prefix.
   - If a mismatch is found or the end of the prefix is reached, update the prefix to the common part up to that point.
   - If at any point the prefix becomes an empty string, return an empty string immediately.
4. Return the resulting prefix after processing all strings.

# Explanation
- Starting with the first string as the initial prefix, we progressively refine this prefix by comparing it with each subsequent string.
- The comparison is character by character until a mismatch is found or the end of the current prefix is reached.
- By updating the prefix during each iteration, we ensure that the prefix is always the longest common prefix found so far.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently find the common prefix without unnecessary comparisons.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n * m)***
  - `n` is the number of strings, and `m` is the length of the longest string. In the worst case, each character of each string is compared.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The space used for the prefix variable is constant and does not depend on the input size.

# Code
```TypeScript
function longestCommonPrefix(strs: string[]): string {
    if (strs.length === 0) return "";

    let prefix = strs[0];
    for (let i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
        while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) !== 0) {
            prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length - 1);
            if (prefix === "") return "";
        }
    }

    return prefix;
};
