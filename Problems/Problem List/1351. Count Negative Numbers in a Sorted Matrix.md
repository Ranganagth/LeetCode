[1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/)

# Intuition:
The matrix is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, meaning that for any given row, values decrease as we move to the right, and for any given column, values decrease as we move down. This makes it easier to efficiently find and count negative numbers using a strategic traversal.

# Approach:
1. **Two-pointer technique**:
   - Start from the top-right corner of the matrix (`grid[0][n-1]`).
   - If the number is negative, it means that all the elements below it in that column are also negative (because the matrix is sorted). Thus, we count all these negative numbers in that column and move left to the next column.
   - If the number is non-negative, move down to the next row to check the subsequent elements in that column.
   - Continue this process until you've either exhausted all columns or rows.
   
2. This method ensures that you efficiently count the negative numbers by skipping unnecessary checks and focusing only on the regions that can contain negatives.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m + n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, we move either left or down at each step, making at most `m + n` moves.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code:
```typescript
function countNegatives(grid: number[][]): number {
    let count = 0;
    let rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
    let row = 0, col = cols - 1;

    while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
        if (grid[row][col] < 0) {
            count += rows - row;
            col--;
        } else {
            row++;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `count`: This variable keeps track of the total number of negative numbers.
   - `row` and `col`: Start at the top-right corner (`grid[0][n-1]`).
   
2. **Traversal**:
   - If the current number is negative, add the number of negative numbers in that column (`rows - row`) to `count`, and move left (to the next column).
   - If the current number is non-negative, move down to the next row.
   
3. **Return the result**: After traversing the matrix, return the total count of negative numbers.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]`

- Start at `grid[0][3] = -1`: it's negative. All numbers below it in the same column are negative (`[grid[1][3], grid[2][3], grid[3][3]]`), so we count `4` negatives and move left to column 2.
- At `grid[0][2] = 2`: it's positive, so we move down to row 1.
- At `grid[1][2] = 1`: it's positive, so we move down to row 2.
- At `grid[2][2] = -1`: it's negative. All numbers below it in the same column (`[grid[3][2]]`) are negative, so we count `2` negatives and move left to column 1.
- At `grid[2][1] = 1`: it's positive, so we move down to row 3.
- At `grid[3][1] = -1`: it's negative. All numbers below it in the same column (`[grid[3][0]]`) are negative, so we count `2` more negatives.
- Total count: 8

Output: `8`

#### Example 2:
Input: `grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]`

- Start at `grid[0][1] = 2`: it's positive, move down.
- At `grid[1][1] = 0`: it's non-negative, move left.
- At `grid[1][0] = 1`: it's positive, no negatives found.

Output: `0`
