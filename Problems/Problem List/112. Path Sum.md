[112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

# Intuition
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: This is a natural choice for problems that involve traversing from the root to leaves.
- **Path Sum Calculation**: As we traverse, we maintain a running sum of the node values. When we reach a leaf node, we check if the running sum matches the target sum.

# Approach
1. **Recursive DFS**: Traverse the tree starting from the root. Subtract the current node's value from the target sum as we go deeper.
2. **Base Case**: If we reach a leaf node (a node with no children), check if the remaining target sum after subtracting the leaf node's value is zero.
3. **Recursive Case**: Recursively check the left and right subtrees.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree. This accounts for the call stack space during the recursion. In the worst case, `h` can be `n` for a skewed tree.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function hasPathSum(root: TreeNode | null, targetSum: number): boolean {
    if (root === null) {
        return false;
    }

    if (root.left === null && root.right === null) {
        return targetSum === root.val;
    }

    const newTargetSum = targetSum - root.val;
    return hasPathSum(root.left, newTargetSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, newTargetSum);
};

```

### Explanation
- **TreeNode Class**: Defines the structure of the binary tree node.
- **hasPathSum Function**: The main function to check for the path with the given target sum.
- **Base Case**: If the node is `null`, return `false`.
- **Leaf Node Check**: If the node is a leaf, compare its value to the remaining target sum.
- **Recursive Calls**: Check the left and right subtrees with the updated target sum.
