[13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)

# Intuition
Roman numerals follow a specific set of rules, where typically larger values precede smaller ones. However, when a smaller value precedes a larger value, it indicates subtraction. This pattern can be used to convert a Roman numeral string to an integer by processing each character and handling the subtraction cases accordingly.

# Approach
1. Create a map (or object) to store the integer values of Roman numeral symbols.
2. Initialize a variable to store the result.
3. Traverse the string from left to right:
   - For each character, compare its value with the value of the next character (if there is one).
   - If the current character's value is less than the next character's value, subtract the current character's value from the result (handle the subtraction case).
   - Otherwise, add the current character's value to the result.
4. Return the result after processing all characters.

# Explanation
- By creating a map of Roman numeral values, we can quickly look up the integer value of each symbol.
- As we iterate through the string, we handle the subtraction cases by checking if the current symbol's value is less than the next symbol's value.
- This approach ensures that all subtraction cases are correctly handled without requiring complex logic.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - We traverse the string once, where `n` is the length of the string.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The space used by the map is constant and does not depend on the input size.

# Code
```TypeScript
function romanToInt(s: string): number {
    const romanMap: { [key: string]: number } = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    };

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const currentVal = romanMap[s[i]];
        const nextVal = i + 1 < s.length ? romanMap[s[i + 1]] : 0;

        if (currentVal < nextVal) {
            result -= currentVal;
        } else {
            result += currentVal;
        }
    }

    return result;
};
