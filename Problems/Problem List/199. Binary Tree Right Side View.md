[199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

# Intuition

When viewing a binary tree from the right side, only the rightmost nodes at each level are visible. This can be achieved by performing a level-order traversal (also known as breadth-first traversal) of the tree and recording the last node encountered at each level.

# Approach

1. **Level-Order Traversal**:
   - Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
   - At each level, keep track of the number of nodes (level size).
   - Traverse all nodes at the current level, and keep updating a variable with the value of the node.
   - After processing all nodes of the current level, the variable will contain the value of the rightmost node for that level, which we add to our result list.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is null), return an empty list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, the queue will hold all the nodes in the last level of the tree, which could be up to n/2 nodes.

# Code
```typescript
function rightSideView(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    if (!root) {
        return [];
    }

    const result: number[] = [];
    const queue: TreeNode[] = [root];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let rightMostValue: number = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            rightMostValue = node.val;

            if (node.left) {
                queue.push(node.left);
            }
            if (node.right) {
                queue.push(node.right);
            }
        }

        result.push(rightMostValue);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - A class to represent each node in the binary tree.

2. **rightSideView Function**:
   - Checks if the root is null and returns an empty array if it is.
   - Initializes a queue with the root node.
   - While there are nodes in the queue, processes each level of the tree:
     - For each level, keeps track of the number of nodes.
     - Iterates through all nodes at the current level, updating `rightMostValue` with the current node's value.
     - Adds children of the current node to the queue.
     - After processing all nodes at the current level, adds `rightMostValue` to the result array.
   - Returns the result array containing the rightmost nodes' values at each level.
