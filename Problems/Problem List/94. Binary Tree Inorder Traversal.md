[94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)

# Intuition
The iterative approach uses a stack to keep track of nodes, as we need to backtrack to the root node after reaching the leftmost node. The process involves:
1. Traversing to the leftmost node and pushing all nodes along the path onto the stack.
2. Popping the stack to process nodes in the correct order (left, root, right).
3. Traversing the right subtree.

# Approach
1. Initialize an empty stack and a result list.
2. Use a pointer to traverse the tree, starting from the root.
3. Push all left nodes onto the stack until there are no more left nodes.
4. Pop the stack, process the node, and move to its right subtree.
5. Repeat until the stack is empty and all nodes are processed.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree, for the stack.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function inorderTraversal(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    const stack: TreeNode[] = [];
    let current: TreeNode | null = root;

    while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }

        current = stack.pop()!;
        result.push(current.val);

        current = current.right;
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **TreeNode Class**: Defines the structure of a tree node.
2. **inorderTraversal Function**: Performs the inorder traversal iteratively using a stack.
3. **Example Usage**: Demonstrates the function with various test cases.
