[2556. Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip](https://leetcode.com/problems/disconnect-path-in-a-binary-matrix-by-at-most-one-flip/)

# Intuition

The task is to determine if it is possible to disconnect the grid by flipping at most one cell from `1` to `0`. A grid is disconnected if there is no path from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right corner `(m - 1, n - 1)`.

# Approach

1. **Initial Path Check**: Perform a DFS to check if there is a path from `(0, 0)` to `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
2. **Mark Visited Cells**: During the DFS traversal, mark cells as visited by setting them to `0`.
3. **Reset Key Cells**: After the first DFS traversal, reset the top-left and bottom-right cells to `1`.
4. **Second Path Check**: Perform another DFS traversal to see if the path still exists after marking cells as visited.
5. **Determine Disconnect**: If both DFS traversals find a path, it means that flipping one cell won't disconnect the grid. Otherwise, it is possible to disconnect the grid.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m × n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because each DFS traversal visits each cell at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** in the worst case due to the recursion stack in the DFS.

# Code

```typescript
function isPossibleToCutPath(grid: number[][]): boolean {
    const numRows = grid.length;
    const numCols = grid[0].length;

    const depthFirstSearch = (rowIndex: number, colIndex: number): boolean => {
        if (rowIndex >= numRows || colIndex >= numCols || grid[rowIndex][colIndex] !== 1) {
            return false;
        }
        grid[rowIndex][colIndex] = 0;
      
        if (rowIndex === numRows - 1 && colIndex === numCols - 1) {
            return true;
        }
      
        return depthFirstSearch(rowIndex + 1, colIndex) || depthFirstSearch(rowIndex, colIndex + 1);
    };

    const firstTraversalResult = depthFirstSearch(0, 0);

    grid[0][0] = 1;
    grid[numRows - 1][numCols - 1] = 1;

    const secondTraversalResult = depthFirstSearch(0, 0);

    return !(firstTraversalResult && secondTraversalResult);
};

```

### Explanation
1. **DFS Traversal**: We use DFS to check if there's a path from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.
2. **Marking Visited Cells**: During the DFS, cells that are part of the path are marked as `0` to denote they have been visited.
3. **Resetting Key Cells**: After the first traversal, we reset the starting and ending cells to `1` to ensure the second traversal can start and end correctly.
4. **Second DFS Traversal**: We perform another DFS to see if the grid is still connected after marking cells as visited.
5. **Disconnect Check**: If both DFS traversals can find a path, it means the grid cannot be disconnected by flipping one cell. Otherwise, it can be disconnected.
