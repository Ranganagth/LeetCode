[451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

# Intuition

The problem requires sorting characters in a string based on their frequency in descending order. To achieve this, we need to count the frequency of each character, sort the characters by their frequencies, and then reconstruct the string based on these sorted frequencies.

# Approach

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Sort Characters**: Sort the characters by their frequency in descending order.
3. **Reconstruct the String**: Construct the output string by repeating each character according to its frequency.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, where *n* is the length of the string. Counting the frequencies takes *O(n)*, sorting the characters by frequency takes ***O(n \log n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the frequency map and the result string.

# Code

```typescript
function frequencySort(s: string): string {
    const freqMap: Map<string, number> = new Map();

    for (const char of s) {
        freqMap.set(char, (freqMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const sortedChars = Array.from(freqMap.entries()).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

    let result = '';
    for (const [char, freq] of sortedChars) {
        result += char.repeat(freq);
    }

    return result;
};

```

## Example usage:

```Typescript
const s1 = "tree";
console.log(frequencySort(s1)); // Output: "eert" or "eetr"

const s2 = "cccaaa";
console.log(frequencySort(s2)); // Output: "cccaaa" or "aaaccc"

const s3 = "Aabb";
console.log(frequencySort(s3)); // Output: "bbAa" or "bbaA"
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   ```typescript
   for (const char of s) {
       freqMap.set(char, (freqMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
   }
   ```
   This loop populates `freqMap` with the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. **Sorting**:
   ```typescript
   const sortedChars = Array.from(freqMap.entries()).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
   ```
   Convert the frequency map to an array of `[char, freq]` pairs and sort it in descending order of frequencies.

3. **Reconstructing the String**:
   ```typescript
   let result = '';
   for (const [char, freq] of sortedChars) {
       result += char.repeat(freq);
   }
   ```
   Build the resulting string by appending each character repeated according to its frequency.
