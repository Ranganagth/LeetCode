[682. Baseball Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/baseball-game/)

# Intuition:

1. **Use a Stack**: 
   - The stack will store all valid scores.
   - When an operation adds a score (either directly, by doubling, or by summing the last two scores), we push that score onto the stack.
   - When an operation invalidates the previous score, we simply pop the top of the stack.
   
2. **Operations**:
   - If the operation is an integer, convert it to a number and push it onto the stack.
   - If the operation is '+', sum the last two scores on the stack and push the result.
   - If the operation is 'D', double the last score and push the result.
   - If the operation is 'C', pop the last score from the stack.
   
3. **Final Sum**:
   - The final score will be the sum of all elements in the stack after processing all operations.

# Approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over each operation in the input list.
3. Apply the corresponding logic based on the operation type ('C', 'D', '+', or an integer).
4. After processing all operations, return the sum of the elements in the stack.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of operations. Each operation is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of operations. In the worst case, all operations result in scores being pushed onto the stack.

# Code:

```typescript
function calPoints(operations: string[]): number {
    const stack: number[] = [];
    
    for (const op of operations) {
        if (op === "C") {
            stack.pop();
        } else if (op === "D") {
            const lastScore = stack[stack.length - 1];
            stack.push(lastScore * 2);
        } else if (op === "+") {
            const lastScore = stack[stack.length - 1];
            const secondLastScore = stack[stack.length - 2];
            stack.push(lastScore + secondLastScore);
        } else {
            stack.push(parseInt(op));
        }
    }
    
    return stack.reduce((acc, score) => acc + score, 0);
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(calPoints(["5","2","C","D","+"])); // Output: 30
console.log(calPoints(["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"])); // Output: 27
console.log(calPoints(["1","C"])); // Output: 0
```

### Explanation with Examples:

1. **Example 1**: `ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]`
   - `5`: Add 5 to the record, stack is `[5]`.
   - `2`: Add 2 to the record, stack is `[5, 2]`.
   - `C`: Invalidate the last score, remove 2, stack is `[5]`.
   - `D`: Double the last score (5 * 2 = 10), stack is `[5, 10]`.
   - `+`: Sum the last two scores (5 + 10 = 15), stack is `[5, 10, 15]`.
   - **Result**: Sum of the stack `[5, 10, 15]` is `30`.

2. **Example 2**: `ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]`
   - The operations will similarly be processed, and the final stack will be `[5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14]`.
   - **Result**: Sum of the stack is `27`.

3. **Example 3**: `ops = ["1","C"]`
   - Add `1`, then remove it. The stack is empty.
   - **Result**: Sum of the stack is `0`.
