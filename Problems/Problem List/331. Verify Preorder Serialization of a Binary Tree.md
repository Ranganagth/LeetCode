[331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-serialization-of-a-binary-tree/)

### Problem Summary

You're given a string that represents a **preorder traversal** serialization of a binary tree. Each node is either an integer or `'#'` representing a null pointer.

Your task is to determine whether this string is a **valid** preorder traversal serialization **without reconstructing the tree**.

---

# Intuition

Each **non-null node** (i.e., an integer) will **generate two child slots** (left and right), while each **null node** (i.e., `#`) **consumes one slot**.

We can track the number of **available slots** while parsing the string:
* Start with **1 slot** (for the root).
* For each node:
  * Consume **1 slot** (for placing the current node).
  * If it's a non-null node, **generate 2 new slots** (for its children).
* The serialization is **valid** if:
  * We **never run out of slots during traversal**, and
  * At the **end**, all slots are exactly used up (i.e., total slots = 0)

---

# Approach

1. Split the `preorder` string by commas.
2. Initialize `slots = 1`.
3. Traverse each node:
   * Consume one slot: `slots -= 1`
   * If `slots < 0`, return false.
   * If node is not `#`, add two slots: `slots += 2`
4. After traversal, return `slots === 0`.

---

# Space Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  Where `n` is the number of nodes (length of string split).
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the split array (can be `O(1)` if you parse directly).

# Code

```ts
function isValidSerialization(preorder: string): boolean {
    const nodes = preorder.split(',');
    let slots = 1;

    for (const node of nodes) {
        slots -= 1; // one slot used

        if (slots < 0) return false; // no more slot to place current node

        if (node !== '#') {
            slots += 2; // non-null node generates two slots
        }
    }

    return slots === 0;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs**

#### **Example 1:**

Input: `"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"`

Step-by-step:
```
Slots start at 1
9 → slots = 0 + 2 = 2
3 → slots = 1 + 2 = 3
4 → slots = 2 + 2 = 4
# → slots = 3
# → slots = 2
1 → slots = 1 + 2 = 3
# → 2
# → 1
2 → 0 + 2 = 2
# → 1
6 → 0 + 2 = 2
# → 1
# → 0
```

All slots used correctly → **Output: true**

---

#### **Example 2:**

Input: `"1,#"`
```
Slots = 1
1 → slots = 0 + 2 = 2
# → slots = 1
```
(No more nodes but slots ≠ 0) → **Output: false**

---

#### **Example 3:**

Input: `"9,#,#,1"`
```
9 → slots = 0 + 2 = 2
# → slots = 1
# → slots = 0
1 → slots = -1 → Invalid
```
**Output: false**

---

### **Summary**

This approach treats the preorder serialization as a process of **managing slots** for placing nodes. By simulating the slot consumption and generation, we can verify whether the structure is valid **without reconstructing the tree**.
