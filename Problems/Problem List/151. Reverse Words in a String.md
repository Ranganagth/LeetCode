[151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of reversing the words in a string `s`, we can use a straightforward approach leveraging JavaScript string manipulation functions. The goal is to handle various edge cases such as leading/trailing spaces and multiple spaces between words.

# Approach

1. **Trimming**: First, trim the input string `s` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.  
2. **Splitting**: Split the trimmed string using a regular expression `\s+` which matches one or more whitespace characters. This will split the string into an array of words.
3. **Reversing**: Reverse the array of words.
4. **Joining**: Join the reversed array into a single string with each word separated by a single space.
5. **Returning**: Return the final reversed string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the input string `s`. The operations involve trimming, splitting, reversing, and joining, all of which are linear in relation to the size of the input string.
  
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the split words in an array.

# Code
```typescript
function reverseWords(s: string): string {
   return s.trim().split(/\s+/).reverse().join(' ');
};

```

### Explanation

- **Trimming**: `s.trim()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the string `s`.  
- **Splitting**: `split(/\s+/)` splits the trimmed string into an array of words, where `\s+` is a regular expression that matches one or more whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.).
- **Reversing**: `reverse()` reverses the array of words.  
- **Joining**: `join(' ')` joins the reversed array into a single string with each word separated by a single space.

### Edge Cases

- The function handles strings with leading or trailing spaces by trimming them.
- Multiple spaces between words are reduced to a single space in the output.
- The function ensures that the output string does not have leading or trailing spaces.
