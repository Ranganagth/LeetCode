[34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)

# Intuition
To find the starting and ending position of a given target value in a sorted array in O(log n) time complexity, we can utilize binary search. The key idea is to perform two separate binary searches: one to find the first occurrence of the target and another to find the last occurrence.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search for the First Occurrence**:
   - Use binary search to find the first position of the target. Modify the binary search to continue searching in the left half even if the target is found to ensure the first occurrence is located.

2. **Binary Search for the Last Occurrence**:
   - Use binary search to find the last position of the target. Modify the binary search to continue searching in the right half even if the target is found to ensure the last occurrence is located.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If the target is found, return the indices of the first and last occurrences. If the target is not found, return [-1, -1].

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where **n** is the length of the array. This is because we are performing binary search twice.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function searchRange(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    function findFirst(nums: number[], target: number): number {
        let left = 0;
        let right = nums.length - 1;
        let firstPos = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (nums[mid] === target) {
                firstPos = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return firstPos;
    }

    function findLast(nums: number[], target: number): number {
        let left = 0;
        let right = nums.length - 1;
        let lastPos = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (nums[mid] === target) {
                lastPos = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return lastPos;
    }

    const firstPos = findFirst(nums, target);
    if (firstPos === -1) return [-1, -1];
    const lastPos = findLast(nums, target);

    return [firstPos, lastPos];
};
