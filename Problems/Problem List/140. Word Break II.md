[140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to generate all possible sentences by adding spaces in the string `s` such that each segment between spaces is a valid word from `wordDict`. This is a classic problem that can be solved efficiently using backtracking with memoization.

# Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach with memoization:

1. **Define the Backtracking Function**:
   - Use a recursive function `backtrack(start)` that starts from index `start` in the string `s`.
   - The function should return an array of all possible sentences that can be formed starting from index `start`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `start` is equal to the length of `s`, return an array with an empty string to signify the end of a valid sentence.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Iterate through each possible ending index `end` starting from `start + 1` up to `s.length`.
   - Check if the substring from `start` to `end` (exclusive) exists in `wordDict`.
   - If it does, recursively call `backtrack(end)` to get all possible sentences that can be formed starting from `end`.
   - Combine the current word with each sentence obtained from `backtrack(end)` to form new sentences.
   - Store these sentences in a result array.

4. **Memoization**:
   - Use a `memo` map to store results for each index `start` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If `memo[start]` exists, return it directly instead of recalculating.

5. **Return Result**:
   - Initialize the recursion with `backtrack(0)` and return the resulting array of sentences.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n ⋅ m²)***, where *n* is the length of `s` and *m* is the size of `wordDict`. Each substring operation takes *O(m)*, and there are *O(n)* possible substrings to consider.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n ⋅ m²)***, for the memoization map and the recursion stack.

This approach ensures that we generate all possible valid sentences efficiently using backtracking and memoization.

# Code
```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): string[] {
    const wordSet = new Set(wordDict);
    const memo = new Map<number, string[]>();

    function backtrack(start: number): string[] {
        if (memo.has(start)) return memo.get(start)!;
        if (start === s.length) return [""];

        const result: string[] = [];

        for (let end = start + 1; end <= s.length; end++) {
            const word = s.substring(start, end);
            if (wordSet.has(word)) {
                const substrings = backtrack(end);
                for (const substring of substrings) {
                    result.push(word + (substring ? " " + substring : ""));
                }
            }
        }

        memo.set(start, result);
        return result;
    }

    return backtrack(0);
};

```
