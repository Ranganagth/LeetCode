[2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings/)

# Intuition

We need to construct strings where the length is between `low` and `high` using two types of operations:
1. Append a character '0' zero times.
2. Append a character '1' one times.

Given that we need to consider strings of varying lengths, dynamic programming can help us keep track of the number of ways to construct strings of specific lengths.

# Approach

1. **Define the DP Array**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to construct a string of length `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` because there is one way to have an empty string.

2. **DP Transitions**:
   - For each length `i` from `1` to `high`, we consider two possible transitions:
     1. If `i` can be reached by appending `zero` '0's to a string of length `i-zero`, then add `dp[i-zero]` to `dp[i]`.
     2. If `i` can be reached by appending `one` '1's to a string of length `i-one`, then add `dp[i-one]` to `dp[i]`.

3. **Summing Valid Lengths**:
   - After populating the DP array, sum up all the values from `dp[low]` to `dp[high]` to get the total number of good strings.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the answer can be large, take modulo *10‚Åπ + 7* at each step to prevent overflow.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n = high*, because we are iterating through each length and computing the transitions.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array.

# Code
```typescript
function countGoodStrings(low: number, high: number, zero: number, one: number): number {
    const MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    const dp = new Array(high + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i <= high; i++) {
        if (i >= zero) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - zero]) % MOD;
        }
        if (i >= one) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - one]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
};

```
