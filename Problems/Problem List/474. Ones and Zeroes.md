[474. Ones and Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)

# Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We'll use a 3D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the maximum size of the subset that can be formed using the first `i` strings with at most `j` 0's and `k` 1's.
2. **State Transition**:
   - If we don't include the current string, the state remains the same.
   - If we include the current string, we need to ensure that adding it doesn't exceed the constraints.
3. **Initialization**: Initialize the `dp` array to 0.

# Approach

1. **Count 0's and 1's**: For each string, count the number of 0's and 1's.
2. **Update DP Table**:
   - Iterate through the strings and update the DP table in reverse to avoid overwriting values that are yet to be processed in the current iteration.
3. **Result**: The value `dp[len(strs)][m][n]` will give the maximum size of the subset.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(len × m × n)***, where ***len(strs)*** is the number of strings.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)***, due to the DP table.

# Code
```typescript
function findMaxForm(strs: string[], m: number, n: number): number {
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (const str of strs) {
        const zeroCount = str.split('').filter(char => char === '0').length;
        const oneCount = str.split('').filter(char => char === '1').length;

        for (let i = m; i >= zeroCount; i--) {
            for (let j = n; j >= oneCount; j--) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeroCount][j - oneCount] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Count 0's and 1's**: For each string, count how many 0's and 1's it contains.
2. **Update DP Array**:
   - Iterate through each string and for each possible count of 0's and 1's from `m` to `zeroCount` and `n` to `oneCount`, update the DP array.
   - The state transition ensures that we only include the current string if it doesn't exceed the given constraints.
3. **Return the Result**: The final value at `dp[m][n]` gives the size of the largest subset that can be formed with at most `m` 0's and `n` 1's.
