[315. Count of Smaller Numbers After Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-smaller-numbers-after-self/)

# Intuition
Given the constraint that the array length can be up to *10⁵*, we need to look for a solution that is better than the naive *O(n²)* approach. One effective way to achieve this is by using a data structure that allows for efficient insertions and order statistics, such as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or a Binary Search Tree (BST).

# Approach

1. **Coordinate Compression**: Since the range of numbers can be large (-10,000 to 10,000), we'll use coordinate compression to map these numbers into a smaller range.
2. **Binary Indexed Tree**: Use a BIT to keep track of the count of elements as we iterate through the array from right to left. For each element, we'll query the BIT to find how many of the already processed elements are smaller than the current element.
3. **Result Array**: Store the result in an array and return it.

### Steps:
1. Perform coordinate compression on the input array to handle the large range of numbers efficiently.
2. Initialize a BIT.
3. Traverse the array from right to left, and for each element:
   - Query the BIT to find the count of elements smaller than the current element.
   - Update the BIT with the current element.
4. Return the result array.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n \log n)*** for processing each element with BIT operations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the BIT and the result array.

# Code
```typescript
function countSmaller(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const result: number[] = new Array(nums.length).fill(0);
    const sortedNums = Array.from(new Set(nums)).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const ranks = new Map<number, number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < sortedNums.length; i++) {
        ranks.set(sortedNums[i], i + 1);
    }

    const BIT = new Array(nums.length + 1).fill(0);

    function update(index: number, value: number): void {
        while (index < BIT.length) {
            BIT[index] += value;
            index += index & -index;
        }
    }

    function query(index: number): number {
        let sum = 0;
        while (index > 0) {
            sum += BIT[index];
            index -= index & -index;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const rank = ranks.get(nums[i])!;
        result[i] = query(rank - 1);
        update(rank, 1);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Coordinate Compression**: We map the numbers to their ranks.
2. **Binary Indexed Tree**: We use the BIT to maintain the counts of numbers as we process the array from right to left.
3. **Updating and Querying BIT**: For each element, we query the BIT to get the count of smaller elements and then update the BIT with the current element's rank.
