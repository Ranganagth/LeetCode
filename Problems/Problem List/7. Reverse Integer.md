[7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

# Intuition
To reverse the digits of a signed 32-bit integer `x`, we can use mathematical operations. We will handle both positive and negative integers, ensuring that the reversed integer does not overflow the 32-bit signed integer range.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable to store the result of reversing the integer, starting with `0`.
2. While `x` is not zero:
   - Calculate the last digit of `x` using `x % 10`.
   - Multiply the result by `10` and add the last digit to it.
   - Update `x` by removing the last digit using `x = Math.floor(x / 10)`.
3. Check if the reversed integer exceeds the 32-bit signed integer range.
4. Return `0` if the reversed integer is out of bounds, otherwise return the reversed integer.

# Explanation
- We use integer arithmetic to reverse `x` without converting it to a string.
- We continuously extract the last digit of `x`, append it to the result, and then remove it from `x`.
- We handle negative integers by ensuring the sign is preserved.
- We check for overflow by comparing the result with the limits of a 32-bit signed integer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(log10(x))***
  - The number of digits in `x` determines the number of iterations, which is approximately `log10(x)`.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function reverse(x: number): number {
    let result = 0;
    while (x !== 0) {
        const digit = x % 10;
        x = Math.trunc(x / 10);
        result = result * 10 + digit;
        
        if (result < -Math.pow(2, 31) || result > Math.pow(2, 31) - 1) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    return result;
};
