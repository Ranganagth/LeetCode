[239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

# Intuition

The problem is to find the maximum value in each sliding window of size `k` as it moves from the leftmost to the rightmost position in the array. This can be efficiently solved using a data structure that supports fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval of the maximum element, such as a deque (double-ended queue).

# Approach

We'll use a deque to help us track the indices of elements in the sliding window. The elements in the deque will be stored in such a way that:
1. Elements are stored in decreasing order from left to right.
2. Only indices within the current window are kept in the deque.

The steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: 
   - Use a deque to store indices of elements from the array.
   - Traverse the first `k` elements of the array to populate the deque with indices of potential maximum values.

2. **Process Sliding Window**:
   - Start iterating from index `k` to the end of the array.
   - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are out of the current window (`i >= k`).
   - Remove indices from the back of the deque while the current element at `nums[i]` is greater than the element at the index stored in the deque.
   - Add the current index `i` to the deque.
   - The front of the deque will always hold the index of the maximum element for the current window.

3. **Store Maximum Value**:
   - After processing each window, store the maximum element from the front of the deque.

4. **Return Results**:
   - After processing all windows, return the array of maximum values.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed twice (added and removed from the deque).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)***, where k is the size of the sliding window. This is the space required for the deque.

# Code
```typescript
function maxSlidingWindow(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    const deque: number[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (deque.length > 0 && deque[0] < i - k + 1) {
            deque.shift();
        }

        while (deque.length > 0 && nums[deque[deque.length - 1]] <= nums[i]) {
            deque.pop();
        }

        deque.push(i);

        if (i >= k - 1) {
            result.push(nums[deque[0]]);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Deque Operations**:
  - We use `deque.shift()` to remove indices that are out of the current window.
  - We use `deque.pop()` to remove indices where the corresponding elements are less than or equal to the current element `nums[i]`.
  - We use `deque.push(i)` to add the current index to the deque.

- **Result Compilation**:
  - Once we have processed at least `k` elements (i.e., reached the first full window), we add the maximum value (front of the deque) to the result array.
