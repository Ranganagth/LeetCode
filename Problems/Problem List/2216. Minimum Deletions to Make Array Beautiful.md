[2216. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-array-beautiful/)

# Intuition
The problem requires transforming the array into a "beautiful" array by deleting the minimum number of elements. A beautiful array has an even length and for every even index *i*, **nums[i] â‰  nums[i+1]**.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Counters**: Use a counter to track the number of deletions and an index to iterate through the array.
2. **Iterate Through Array**: Traverse the array while comparing pairs of elements.
3. **Check for Duplicates**: If two consecutive elements are the same, skip the current element by incrementing the index and increment the deletion counter.
4. **Check for Pairs**: If the elements are different, move to the next pair by incrementing the index by 2.
5. **Adjust for Even Length**: After processing, if the resulting length is odd, increment the deletion counter to make it even.
6. **Return Result**: Return the number of deletions required.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, no extra space is used except for a few variables.

# Code

```typescript
function minDeletion(nums: number[]): number {
    const length = nums.length;
    let deletionCount = 0;
    let index = 0;

    while (index < length - 1) {
        if (nums[index] === nums[index + 1]) {
            index++;
            deletionCount++;
        } else {
            index += 2;
        }
    }

    if ((length - deletionCount) % 2 === 1) {
        deletionCount++;
    }

    return deletionCount;
};

```

### Explanation of Code
- **Initialization**: 
  - `length` holds the length of the array.
  - `deletionCount` keeps track of the number of deletions required.
  - `index` is used to traverse the array.
- **While loop**: 
  - Traverse the array while comparing pairs of elements.
  - If `nums[index]` equals `nums[index + 1]`, increment `deletionCount` and skip the next element by adjusting `index`.
  - If they are different, move to the next pair by incrementing `index` by 2.
- **Adjust for Even Length**: 
  - After processing, if the resulting length is odd, increment `deletionCount` to make it even.
- **Return**: 
  - Finally, return the number of deletions required.
