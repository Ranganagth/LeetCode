[299. Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/)

### **Problem Summary: Bulls and Cows**

Given two strings `secret` and `guess`, you need to return a hint indicating:
* How many digits are **bulls** (same digit at the same position).
* How many digits are **cows** (same digit but in the wrong position).

Return the result in the format: `xAyB`.

---

# Intuition

We compare both strings character by character:
* If characters at the same index match → it's a **bull**.
* Otherwise, we record the frequency of unmatched digits from both `secret` and `guess`.
* After counting bulls, we compute **cows** as the minimum number of unmatched digits that appear in both `secret` and `guess`.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize counters for bulls and cows.
2. Loop through both strings:
   * If digits at index `i` match → increment `bulls`.
   * Otherwise → update frequency counts of unmatched digits.
3. For all unmatched digits, the number of **cows** is the minimum of their frequency in `secret` and `guess`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n) — single pass through strings of length `n`.
* **Space:** O(10) → constant space since we only track digits 0–9.

# Code

```ts
function getHint(secret: string, guess: string): string {
    const secretFreq = new Array(10).fill(0);
    const guessFreq = new Array(10).fill(0);
    let bulls = 0;
    let cows = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < secret.length; i++) {
        const s = secret[i];
        const g = guess[i];
        if (s === g) {
            bulls++;
        } else {
            secretFreq[parseInt(s)]++;
            guessFreq[parseInt(g)]++;
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cows += Math.min(secretFreq[i], guessFreq[i]);
    }

    return `${bulls}A${cows}B`;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

* `secret = "1807"`, `guess = "7810"`
* Match positions: index 2 → `0` is a bull.
* Unmatched:

  * secret: 1, 8, 7
  * guess: 7, 8, 1
* Cows = all unmatched match out of place → cows = 3
* **Output: `1A3B`**

#### Example 2:

* `secret = "1123"`, `guess = "0111"`
* Match position: index 1 → `1` is a bull
* Unmatched:

  * secret: 1, 2, 3
  * guess: 0, 1, 1
* Only one unmatched `1` can be used as a cow → cows = 1
* **Output: `1A1B`**

### **Summary**

This approach efficiently counts bulls and cows using frequency arrays, working in a single pass and constant space. It handles duplicates correctly and provides an optimal solution for the problem.
