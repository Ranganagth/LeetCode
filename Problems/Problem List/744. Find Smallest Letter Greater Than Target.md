[744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/)

# Intuition

The problem asks us to find the smallest character in the array `letters` that is strictly greater than the given `target`. Since the array `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order, this can be efficiently solved using a binary search, which operates in ***O(log n)*** time.

# Approach

1. **Binary Search**:
   - We'll perform binary search to find the first character in the array that is greater than `target`.
   - During the search, we update our search bounds (left and right) based on whether the middle character is greater than the `target`.
   - If no character in the array is greater than the `target`, we wrap around and return the first character (`letters[0]`).

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize two pointers: `left` pointing to the start and `right` to the end of the array.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, compute the middle index and check if the middle character is greater than `target`.
   - If it is greater, move the `right` pointer to search in the left half.
   - Otherwise, move the `left` pointer to search in the right half.
   - If the binary search completes and we haven't found a valid character, return the first character in the array.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If all characters in the array are less than or equal to the target, we return the first character since the array is circular in nature.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function nextGreatestLetter(letters: string[], target: string): string {
    let left = 0;
    let right = letters.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (letters[mid] > target) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return letters[left % letters.length];
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(nextGreatestLetter(["c","f","j"], "a"));  // Output: "c"
console.log(nextGreatestLetter(["c","f","j"], "c"));  // Output: "f"
console.log(nextGreatestLetter(["x","x","y","y"], "z"));  // Output: "x"
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Input**:
   - `letters`: A sorted array of characters.
   - `target`: A character for which we need to find the next lexicographically larger character.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We perform binary search over the array, adjusting our search range based on whether the middle element is greater than `target`.
   - If the search ends without finding a suitable character, the index `left` will point to the smallest character greater than `target`, or to the first character in the array if no greater character exists.

3. **Wrapping Around**:
   - If `left` exceeds the length of the array, we return the first character by using the modulo operation: `letters[left % letters.length]`.

### Example Walkthrough

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `letters = ["c","f","j"]`, `target = "a"`
   - Binary search steps:
     - `mid = 1` (letters[1] = "f"), which is greater than "a", so `right = 0`.
     - `mid = 0` (letters[0] = "c"), which is greater than "a", so `right = -1`.
   - We return `letters[left % 3] = letters[0] = "c"`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `letters = ["c","f","j"]`, `target = "c"`
   - Binary search steps:
     - `mid = 1` (letters[1] = "f"), which is greater than "c", so `right = 0`.
   - We return `letters[left % 3] = letters[1] = "f"`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `letters = ["x","x","y","y"]`, `target = "z"`
   - No character is greater than "z", so we wrap around and return `letters[0] = "x"`.
