[66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/)

# Intuition
To increment a large integer represented as an array of digits by one, we need to handle potential carries through the array. This can be achieved by starting from the least significant digit (the end of the array) and moving towards the most significant digit (the start of the array). If a digit is 9 and we need to increment it, it becomes 0, and we carry over 1 to the next significant digit.

# Approach

1. **Start from the least significant digit**:
   - Traverse the array from the last digit to the first digit.
   - If the digit is less than 9, increment it and return the array as the result.
   - If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue to the next digit to the left (since a carry-over is needed).

2. **Handle all 9s**:
   - If all digits are 9, after the loop ends, all digits will be 0.
   - We need to add an extra digit 1 at the beginning of the array (since 999 + 1 = 1000).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where `n` is the length of the array. We might need to traverse all digits in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space, aside from the input and output arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function plusOne(digits: number[]): number[] {
    for (let i = digits.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (digits[i] < 9) {
            digits[i]++;
            return digits;
        }
        digits[i] = 0;
    }
    
    digits.unshift(1);
    return digits;
};
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Loop through the array from end to start**:
   - If the current digit is less than 9, simply increment the digit and return the array.
   - If the current digit is 9, set it to 0 (since 9 + 1 results in 10, and 0 is the new value, with a carry-over).

2. **Handle the all-9s case**:
   - If the loop completes and all digits were set to 0, it means the input was something like 999...9.
   - We need to add a leading 1 at the start of the array to represent the incremented value (1000...0).
