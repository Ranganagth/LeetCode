[2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions/)

# Intuition

1. **Node Mapping**:
    
    - We maintain a mapping (`nodes` dictionary) of node values to their corresponding `TreeNode` objects. This allows us to easily retrieve or create nodes as we iterate through the descriptions.
2. **Building Relationships**:
    
    - Iterate through each description and:
        - Create nodes for the parent and child if they haven't been created already.
        - Link the child node to the parent node based on the `isLeft` value. If `isLeft` is `1`, the child becomes the left child; otherwise, it becomes the right child.
3. **Identifying the Root**:
    
    - After processing all descriptions, identify the root node. The root node is the node that appears as a parent but not as a child in any of the descriptions. This is because the root node does not have any parent.

# Approach

1. **Node Mapping**:
   - Create a dictionary to store the nodes by their values.
   
2. **Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Use the descriptions to establish the parent-child relationships, creating nodes as needed.
   
3. **Determine the Root**:
   - Use a set to keep track of child nodes.
   - The root node will be the one that is not in the set of child nodes.

# Detailed Steps

1. **Create Nodes and Build Relationships**:
   - Traverse the descriptions, and for each entry `[parent, child, isLeft]`, create the nodes if they do not already exist.
   - Link the child node to the parent node based on the `isLeft` value.

2. **Identify the Root**:
   - After building the tree, determine the root by checking which node is not present in the child set.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of descriptions since we iterate over the descriptions multiple times (but each operation is efficient).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the nodes and their relationships.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val: number, left: TreeNode | null = null, right: TreeNode | null = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function createBinaryTree(descriptions: number[][]): TreeNode | null {
    const nodes: Map<number, TreeNode> = new Map();
    const children: Set<number> = new Set();
    
    for (const [parent, child, isLeft] of descriptions) {
        if (!nodes.has(parent)) {
            nodes.set(parent, new TreeNode(parent));
        }
        if (!nodes.has(child)) {
            nodes.set(child, new TreeNode(child));
        }
        
        const parentNode = nodes.get(parent)!;
        const childNode = nodes.get(child)!;
        
        if (isLeft === 1) {
            parentNode.left = childNode;
        } else {
            parentNode.right = childNode;
        }
        
        children.add(child);
    }
    
    let root: TreeNode | null = null;
    for (const [parent] of descriptions) {
        if (!children.has(parent)) {
            root = nodes.get(parent)!;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return root;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **TreeNode Class**: A simple class to define the structure of a tree node.
- **createBinaryTree Function**:
  - **Node Creation and Relationship Building**: For each description, create nodes if they donâ€™t already exist and establish the left or right child relationship.
  - **Root Identification**: After processing all descriptions, identify the root node as the node that never appears as a child.
