[160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that two pointers traversing both lists will eventually align and meet at the intersection point, if there is one. This is because the lengths of the two lists can be different, and by switching the pointers to the head of the other list when they reach the end of their respective lists, we ensure they traverse the same total distance.

# Approach

1. Initialize two pointers, `pointerA` and `pointerB`, at the heads of `listA` and `listB` respectively.
2. Traverse through the lists using the two pointers:
   - If `pointerA` reaches the end of `listA`, reset it to the head of `listB`.
   - If `pointerB` reaches the end of `listB`, reset it to the head of `listA`.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time.
3. Continue this process until the two pointers meet at the intersection node or both reach the end (`null`).
4. If they meet at a node, that node is the intersection node. If they both reach `null`, it means there is no intersection.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m + n)*** where m is the length of `listA` and n is the length of `listB`. Each pointer traverses each list exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because we are only using two pointers and no additional data structures.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function getIntersectionNode(headA: ListNode | null, headB: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!headA || !headB) return null;

    let pointerA: ListNode | null = headA;
    let pointerB: ListNode | null = headB;

    while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
        pointerA = pointerA ? pointerA.next : headB;
        pointerB = pointerB ? pointerB.next : headA;
    }

    return pointerA;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: Two pointers `pointerA` and `pointerB` are initialized to the heads of `listA` and `listB` respectively.
- **Traversal**: The while loop continues until `pointerA` equals `pointerB`.
  - If `pointerA` reaches the end of `listA`, it is reset to the head of `listB`.
  - If `pointerB` reaches the end of `listB`, it is reset to the head of `listA`.
  - Both pointers move one step at a time.
- **Termination**: The loop exits when the two pointers are either at the intersection node or both are `null`.
- **Return Statement**: The function returns the node where the intersection occurs or `null` if there is no intersection.
