[2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-the-maximum-difference-of-pairs/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to use a combination of sorting and binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference among the pairs. The main idea is to leverage binary search to explore possible maximum differences and use a greedy approach to check if it's possible to form `p` pairs with that maximum difference.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array simplifies the process of finding pairs with minimum differences.
2. **Binary Search on the Answer**: We will use binary search to find the smallest possible maximum difference. The range for the binary search will be from `0` (minimum difference) to the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the sorted array.
3. **Greedy Pairing**: For each midpoint in the binary search, check if it's possible to form `p` pairs such that the maximum difference of any pair is less than or equal to the midpoint. If it is possible, then the midpoint is a candidate for the minimum maximum difference.

### Steps:
1. Sort the `nums` array.
2. Define the binary search range.
3. For each midpoint in the binary search, use a greedy approach to count how many pairs can be formed with a difference less than or equal to the midpoint.
4. Adjust the binary search range based on whether it's possible to form `p` pairs or not.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: *O(n log n)* due to sorting, and each binary search step involves an *O(n)* check, resulting in a total complexity of ***O(n log n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space beyond the input array.

# Code
```typescript
function minimizeMaxDifference(nums: number[], p: number): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];

    const canFormPairs = (maxDiff: number): boolean => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < nums.length && count < p; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= maxDiff) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return count >= p;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canFormPairs(mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sort the Array**: We first sort the array to make it easier to find pairs with small differences.
2. **Binary Search on Maximum Difference**: We perform binary search on the possible values of the maximum difference.
3. **Greedy Pairing Check**: For each candidate maximum difference, we check if we can form at least `p` pairs without any overlap where the difference between elements in each pair is less than or equal to the candidate value.
4. **Adjust the Search Range**: Based on the result of the pairing check, we adjust our binary search range to find the minimum possible maximum difference.
