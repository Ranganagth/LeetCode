[1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to determine the wealthiest customer by calculating the total amount of money each customer has across all their bank accounts and then finding the maximum of these values.

# Approach

1. **Calculate Wealth for Each Customer**:
   - Iterate over each customer (each row in the matrix).
   - For each customer, sum the amounts in all their bank accounts (all elements in the row).

2. **Find the Maximum Wealth**:
   - Keep track of the maximum wealth encountered during the iteration.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m Ã— n)***, where *m* is the number of customers and *n* is the number of bank accounts per customer. We need to iterate through all elements of the matrix.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results.

# Code
```typescript
function maximumWealth(accounts: number[][]): number {
    let maxWealth = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
        let currentWealth = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
            currentWealth += accounts[i][j];
        }
        if (currentWealth > maxWealth) {
            maxWealth = currentWealth;
        }
    }

    return maxWealth;
};

```
