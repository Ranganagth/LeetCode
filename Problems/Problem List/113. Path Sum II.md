[113. Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)

# Intuition

The problem requires finding all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree where the sum of node values equals a given target sum. We can solve this using Depth-First Search (DFS) because it allows us to explore all possible paths from the root to the leaves.

# Approach

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will use DFS to traverse the tree. This approach involves exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
2. **Track the Path**: During the DFS traversal, we keep track of the current path and the current sum of node values.
3. **Check Leaf Nodes**: When we reach a leaf node, we check if the current sum equals the target sum. If it does, we save the current path.
4. **Backtracking**: After exploring one path, we backtrack to explore other possible paths. This involves removing the current node from the path before returning to the previous node.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(N)***, where N is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, we visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(H)***, where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height can be `N`.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function pathSum(root: TreeNode | null, targetSum: number): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    
    const dfs = (node: TreeNode | null, currentPath: number[], currentSum: number) => {
        if (node === null) return;

        currentPath.push(node.val);
        currentSum += node.val;
        
        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            if (currentSum === targetSum) {
                result.push([...currentPath]);
            }
        } else {
            if (node.left !== null) dfs(node.left, currentPath, currentSum);
            if (node.right !== null) dfs(node.right, currentPath, currentSum);
        }
        
        currentPath.pop();
    };

    dfs(root, [], 0);
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class**: Defines a node of the binary tree.
2. **pathSum Function**: Initializes the result array and starts the DFS traversal from the root node.
3. **DFS Function**: 
   - Adds the current node's value to `currentPath` and updates `currentSum`.
   - Checks if the current node is a leaf and if the `currentSum` equals `targetSum`. If true, the current path is added to the result.
   - Recursively explores the left and right subtrees.
   - Backtracks by removing the current node from `currentPath`.
