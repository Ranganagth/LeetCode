[127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)

# Intuition
This problem can be modeled as a shortest path problem in an unweighted graph where each word represents a node. There is an edge between two nodes if their corresponding words differ by exactly one character. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) allows us to find the shortest path (minimum number of transformations) from `beginWord` to `endWord`.

# Approach
1. **Initial Check**: If `endWord` is not in the `wordList`, return 0 since no transformation is possible.
2. **Graph Construction**: Create an adjacency list where each word points to other words that are one character different.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Initialize a queue with the `beginWord` and a step count of 1.
   - Use a set to track visited words to avoid processing the same word multiple times.
   - For each word in the queue, generate all possible one-character transformations.
   - If a transformation matches the `endWord`, return the current step count incremented by 1.
   - If a transformation is in the `wordList` and hasn't been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
4. **Return Result**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the `endWord`, return 0.

# Explanation
1. **BFS**: BFS is ideal for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path. By exploring all one-character transformations level by level, BFS ensures that the first time we reach the `endWord`, it is through the shortest path.
2. **Valid Transformations**: Only consider transformations that are present in the `wordList`, ensuring all intermediate transformations are valid.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The BFS will process each word at most once, and for each word, it generates up to `L * 26` possible transformations, where `L` is the length of the word. Thus, the complexity is ***O(N * L * 26)***, where `N` is the number of words in the `wordList`.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(N * L)*** for storing the adjacency list and the visited set.

# Code
```TypeScript
function ladderLength(beginWord: string, endWord: string, wordList: string[]): number {
    const wordSet = new Set(wordList);
    if (!wordSet.has(endWord)) return 0;

    const queue: [string, number][] = [[beginWord, 1]];
    const visited = new Set<string>();
    visited.add(beginWord);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentWord, steps] = queue.shift()!;
        
        if (currentWord === endWord) {
            return steps;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < currentWord.length; i++) {
            for (let c = 97; c <= 122; c++) {
                const newWord = currentWord.slice(0, i) + String.fromCharCode(c) + currentWord.slice(i + 1);
                
                if (wordSet.has(newWord) && !visited.has(newWord)) {
                    queue.push([newWord, steps + 1]);
                    visited.add(newWord);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return 0;
};
