[264. Ugly Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number-ii/)

# Intuition
Ugly numbers are numbers whose only prime factors are 2, 3, and 5. To find the nth ugly number, we can generate the sequence of ugly numbers in order. The sequence starts with 1, and each subsequent number is obtained by multiplying the smallest known ugly number by 2, 3, or 5, and ensuring the resulting number is unique and in ascending order.

# Approach
1. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the next potential ugly numbers.
2. Start with 1 in the heap.
3. Repeatedly extract the smallest number from the heap and generate new ugly numbers by multiplying it by 2, 3, and 5.
4. Use a set to keep track of numbers already seen to avoid duplicates.
5. Continue this process until the nth ugly number is found.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the heap operations (insertion and extraction).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** to store the numbers in the heap and set.

# Code
```typescript
function nthUglyNumber(n: number): number {
    const minHeap: number[] = [1];
    const seen = new Set<number>();
    seen.add(1);

    const primes = [2, 3, 5];
    
    let ugly = 1;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        ugly = minHeap.shift()!;
        for (const prime of primes) {
            const nextUgly = ugly * prime;
            if (!seen.has(nextUgly)) {
                minHeap.push(nextUgly);
                seen.add(nextUgly);
            }
        }
        minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }
    
    return ugly;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialize**: Start with a min-heap containing the number 1, and a set to keep track of the numbers that have already been generated.
2. **Heap Operations**: Extract the smallest number from the heap, multiply it by 2, 3, and 5, and insert the results back into the heap if they haven't been seen before.
3. **Iteration**: Repeat the process n times. The nth extracted number is the nth ugly number.
4. **Return Result**: The nth ugly number is returned as the result.
