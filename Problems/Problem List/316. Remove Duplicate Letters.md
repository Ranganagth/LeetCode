[316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)

### Problem Summary

You are given a string `s`, and you must remove duplicate letters such that:
* Every letter appears **once and only once**.
* The resulting string is the **smallest in lexicographical order** among all such results.

---

# Intuition

This problem is similar to building a **monotonic increasing subsequence** where:
* We keep characters in lexicographical order.
* We ensure that **each character appears only once**.
* If we find a **smaller character**, and we know the **larger one will appear again later**, we can safely remove the larger one.

This is best handled with a **stack** to build the result and a **greedy** approach to ensure the smallest lexicographical sequence.

---

# Approach

1. **Count frequency** of each character in the string.
2. Use a **stack** to build the result string.
3. Use a **Set** to track which characters are in the stack (to avoid duplicates).
4. Iterate through the string:
   * Decrease the count for the current character.
   * If it is **already in the stack**, skip.
   * While:
     * The stack is **not empty**,
     * The top of the stack is **lex greater** than current character,
     * AND the top character **still appears later** (its count > 0),
     * We pop the top from the stack and mark it as not in stack.
   * Push the current character to the stack and mark it in the stack.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
  * Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
  
* **Space**: `O(1)` since only 26 lowercase English letters are stored in the stack/set/map.

# Code

```ts
function removeDuplicateLetters(s: string): string {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    const seen = new Set<string>();
    const lastIndex: Map<string, number> = new Map();

    // Step 1: Record the last index of each character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        lastIndex.set(s[i], i);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];

        // Skip if already in stack
        if (seen.has(char)) continue;

        // Remove characters that are bigger and will appear again
        while (
            stack.length > 0 &&
            char < stack[stack.length - 1] &&
            lastIndex.get(stack[stack.length - 1])! > i
        ) {
            const removed = stack.pop()!;
            seen.delete(removed);
        }

        stack.push(char);
        seen.add(char);
    }

    return stack.join('');
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1

```ts
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

* Characters: b → c → a → b → c
* Stack Progress:

  * b → \[b]
  * c → \[b, c]
  * a: a < c, and c will appear again → pop c

    * a < b, and b will appear again → pop b → push a → \[a]
  * b → push → \[a, b]
  * c → push → \[a, b, c]

**Output:** "abc"

#### Example 2

```ts
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

* Stack Progress:

  * c → \[c]
  * b → b < c → pop c → \[b]
  * a → a < b → pop b → \[a]
  * c → push → \[a, c]
  * d → push → \[a, c, d]
  * c → already in stack
  * b → b < d, but d won't appear again → keep d → push b → \[a, c, d, b]
  * c → already in stack

**Output:** "acdb"

---

### **Summary**

* Use a **greedy + stack** approach.
* Always aim to remove larger characters if they reappear later.
* Track characters in stack to ensure **uniqueness**.
* Time and space efficient: `O(n)` time, `O(1)` space for alphabet size.
