[75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

# Intuition:
The Dutch National Flag algorithm uses three pointers to partition the array into three sections: one for each color. The idea is to maintain the following invariants during the sorting process:
- Elements before the `low` pointer are all 0s (red).
- Elements between the `low` and `mid` pointers are all 1s (white).
- Elements after the `high` pointer are all 2s (blue).

# Approach:
1. Initialize three pointers: `low` at the beginning, `mid` at the beginning, and `high` at the end of the array.
2. Iterate through the array using the `mid` pointer.
   - If the current element is 0 (red), swap it with the element at the `low` pointer, and increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If the current element is 1 (white), just move the `mid` pointer.
   - If the current element is 2 (blue), swap it with the element at the `high` pointer, and decrement `high`.
3. Continue this process until the `mid` pointer surpasses the `high` pointer.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

# Code
```typescript
function sortColors(nums: number[]): void {
    let low = 0;
    let mid = 0;
    let high = nums.length - 1;

    while (mid <= high) {
        if (nums[mid] === 0) {
            [nums[low], nums[mid]] = [nums[mid], nums[low]];
            low++;
            mid++;
        } else if (nums[mid] === 1) {
            mid++;
        } else {
            [nums[mid], nums[high]] = [nums[high], nums[mid]];
            high--;
        }
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `low`, `mid` are initialized to 0.
   - `high` is initialized to the last index of the array.
2. **Iteration and Partitioning**:
   - If `nums[mid]` is 0, swap it with `nums[low]` and move both `low` and `mid` forward.
   - If `nums[mid]` is 1, just move `mid` forward.
   - If `nums[mid]` is 2, swap it with `nums[high]` and move `high` backward.
3. **Termination**:
   - The loop continues until `mid` surpasses `high`, ensuring all elements are sorted in the desired order.
