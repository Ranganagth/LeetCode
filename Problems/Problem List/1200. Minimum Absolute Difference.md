[1200. Minimum Absolute Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference/)

To solve this problem efficiently, we can take advantage of sorting. Once the array is sorted, the minimum absolute difference between any two elements will be among adjacent elements. This simplifies the problem significantly.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the given array in ascending order.
2. **Find the Minimum Absolute Difference**: Iterate through the sorted array and find the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements.
3. **Collect Pairs with the Minimum Difference**: Iterate through the sorted array again and collect all pairs of adjacent elements that have the minimum absolute difference.
4. **Return the Result**: Return the collected pairs.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array.
2. Traverse the sorted array to find the minimum absolute difference.
3. Traverse the sorted array again to collect all pairs that have this minimum absolute difference.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space beyond the input and output.

# Code

```typescript
function minimumAbsDifference(arr: number[]): number[][] {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const result: number[][] = [];
    let minDiff = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        const diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
        if (diff < minDiff) {
            minDiff = diff;
        }
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] === minDiff) {
            result.push([arr[i - 1], arr[i]]);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sort the Array**: We sort the array in ascending order.
2. **Find the Minimum Absolute Difference**: We iterate through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements.
3. **Collect Pairs**: We iterate through the array again to collect all pairs of consecutive elements that have this minimum difference.
4. **Return the Result**: The result is the list of pairs with the minimum absolute difference, sorted in ascending order.
