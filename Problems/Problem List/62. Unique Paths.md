[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

# Intuition

The problem is essentially about finding all possible ways to navigate from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid, where you can only move either right or down. This is a classic dynamic programming problem where the solution to a subproblem can be built up using solutions to smaller subproblems.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: 
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths to reach cell `(i, j)`.
   - Initialize the first row and the first column of the table to 1 because there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row (all moves are right) and any cell in the first column (all moves are down).

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` starting from `(1, 1)`, the number of unique paths to reach `(i, j)` is the sum of the number of unique paths to reach the cell directly above it `(i-1, j)` and the cell directly to the left of it `(i, j-1)`.
   - This is because you can only reach `(i, j)` from either the cell above or the cell to the left.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The value in the bottom-right cell `dp[m-1][n-1]` will be the total number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** because we need to fill an `m × n` table.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** for storing the DP table.

# Code

```typescript
function uniquePaths(m: number, n: number): number {
    const dp: number[][] = new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(1));

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
        }
    }

    return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
};
