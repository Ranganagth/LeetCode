[997. Find the Town Judge](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

# Intuition

To determine the town judge, we need to identify a person who is trusted by everyone else but does not trust anyone themselves. We can use two arrays to keep track of the number of people each person trusts and the number of people who trust them.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Arrays**:
   - `trustCounts`: an array where `trustCounts[i]` keeps track of the number of people who trust person `i`.
   - `trustedByCounts`: an array where `trustedByCounts[i]` keeps track of the number of people person `i` trusts.

2. **Populate Arrays**:
   - Iterate through the `trust` array, updating the arrays accordingly.
   - For each `trust[i] = [a, b]`, increment `trustCounts[b]` and `trustedByCounts[a]`.

3. **Identify the Judge**:
   - Iterate through each person from `1` to `n`.
   - Check if `trustCounts[i]` is equal to `n - 1` (trusted by everyone except themselves) and `trustedByCounts[i]` is `0` (trusts nobody).

4. **Return the Result**:
   - If a person satisfies both conditions, they are the judge.
   - If no such person is found, return `-1`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` is the number of people and `m` is the number of trust relationships. We iterate through the trust array once and then iterate through the people once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the two arrays used to track trust relationships.

# Code

```typescript
function findJudge(n: number, trust: number[][]): number {
    if (n === 1) return 1;

    const trustCounts: number[] = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    const trustedByCounts: number[] = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (const [a, b] of trust) {
        trustCounts[b]++;
        trustedByCounts[a]++;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (trustCounts[i] === n - 1 && trustedByCounts[i] === 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
};

// Example usage
console.log(findJudge(2, [[1, 2]])); // Output: 2
console.log(findJudge(3, [[1, 3], [2, 3]])); // Output: 3
console.log(findJudge(3, [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 1]])); // Output: -1
console.log(findJudge(1, [])); // Output: 1 (special case where there's only one person)
```

### Explanation of Example Usage

1. **Example 1**:
   - `n = 2`, `trust = [[1, 2]]`
   - Person `1` trusts person `2`.
   - Person `2` is trusted by `1` and trusts nobody.
   - Output: `2` (Person `2` is the judge).

2. **Example 2**:
   - `n = 3`, `trust = [[1, 3], [2, 3]]`
   - Person `1` and `2` both trust person `3`.
   - Person `3` trusts nobody.
   - Output: `3` (Person `3` is the judge).

3. **Example 3**:
   - `n = 3`, `trust = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 1]]`
   - Person `3` trusts person `1`, violating the rule that the judge trusts nobody.
   - Output: `-1` (No judge found).

4. **Example 4**:
   - `n = 1`, `trust = []`
   - There is only one person and no trust relationships.
   - Special case handled to return the single person as the judge.
   - Output: `1`.
