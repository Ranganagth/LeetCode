[257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

### Problem: Binary Tree Paths

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. Your task is to return **all paths from the root to each leaf** node as strings.

A **leaf node** is defined as a node that has **no left or right child**.

# Intuition

We need to traverse the binary tree and collect every path from the root node to each leaf node. The best way to do this is through **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:

* As we traverse from the root, we build a string like `1->2->5`.
* When we reach a leaf node, we add the built path to our result list.

# Approach

1. Start DFS from the root.
2. Maintain a string `path` to keep track of the current traversal.
3. If a node is a leaf, add the current `path` to the result list.
4. Recur for left and right children with updated paths.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) — every node is visited exactly once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(h) — due to recursive stack depth, where `h` is the height of the tree.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.left = left ?? null;
        this.right = right ?? null;
    }
}

function binaryTreePaths(root: TreeNode | null): string[] {
    const result: string[] = [];

    const dfs = (node: TreeNode | null, path: string) => {
        if (!node) return;

        // Build the path
        path += node.val.toString();

        // If it's a leaf, add the path
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            result.push(path);
            return;
        }

        // Otherwise, continue to traverse
        path += '->';
        dfs(node.left, path);
        dfs(node.right, path);
    };

    dfs(root, '');
    return result;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input:

```ts
root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5]
```

Tree structure:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
   \
    5
```

#### Execution:

* DFS goes to `1->2->5`, adds `"1->2->5"` to result.
* DFS goes to `1->3`, adds `"1->3"` to result.

#### Output:

```ts
["1->2->5", "1->3"]
```

---

### Summary

* Use DFS to build and collect all root-to-leaf paths.
* Track path as you traverse, and when you hit a leaf, save it.
* Simple and effective approach using recursion.
