[72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

# Intuition

The problem of converting one string to another using a minimum number of operations (insert, delete, replace) is a classic dynamic programming problem known as the Edit Distance or Levenshtein Distance problem. The idea is to use a 2D DP table where the cell at position `(i, j)` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first *i* characters of `word1` to the first *j* characters of `word2`.

# Approach

1. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations to convert the first *i* characters of `word1` to the first *j* characters of `word2`.
   - Initialize `dp[0][j]` for all *j* from 0 to `word2.length` because converting an empty `word1` to the first *j* characters of `word2` requires *j* insertions.
   - Initialize `dp[i][0]` for all *i* from 0 to `word1.length` because converting the first *i* characters of `word1` to an empty `word2` requires *i* deletions.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\), compute `dp[i][j]` based on the following conditions:
     - If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because no new operation is needed.
     - Otherwise, consider the three possible operations (insert, delete, replace) and take the minimum:
       - Insert: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
       - Delete: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
       - Replace: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The value in `dp[word1.length][word2.length]` will be the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m × n)***, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** for the DP table.

# Code
```javascript
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
    const m = word1.length;
    const n = word2.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            if (i === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = j;
            } else if (j === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = i;
            } else if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
};
