[87. Scramble String](https://leetcode.com/problems/scramble-string/)

# Intuition
1. **Base Case**: If the two strings are equal, they are trivially scrambled versions of each other.
2. **Character Count Check**: If the character counts of the two strings do not match, they cannot be scrambled versions of each other.
3. **Recursive Splitting and Checking**: Recursively split the strings into all possible pairs of substrings and check if the substrings are scrambled versions of each other. This includes both scenarios: with and without swapping the substrings.

# Approach
1. **Memoization**: Use a map to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.
2. **Recursive Function**: Create a function `isScramble` that takes two strings and checks if they are scrambled versions of each other.
3. **Character Frequency Matching**: Before diving into recursion, check if both strings have the same character frequencies.
4. **Recursive Splitting**: Split the strings at every possible index and recursively check both without swapping and with swapping.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity is ***O(n⁴)*** because for each pair of substrings, we might check all pairs of partitions and do this recursively.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n³)*** for memoization storage and recursion stack space.

# Code
```typescript
function isScramble(s1: string, s2: string): boolean {
    const memo = new Map<string, boolean>();

    function helper(s1: string, s2: string): boolean {
        const key = s1 + "," + s2;
        if (memo.has(key)) {
            return memo.get(key)!;
        }

        if (s1 === s2) {
            memo.set(key, true);
            return true;
        }

        if (s1.length !== s2.length || [...s1].sort().join('') !== [...s2].sort().join('')) {
            memo.set(key, false);
            return false;
        }

        const n = s1.length;
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (
                (helper(s1.slice(0, i), s2.slice(0, i)) && helper(s1.slice(i), s2.slice(i))) ||
                (helper(s1.slice(0, i), s2.slice(n - i)) && helper(s1.slice(i), s2.slice(0, n - i)))
            ) {
                memo.set(key, true);
                return true;
            }
        }

        memo.set(key, false);
        return false;
    }

    return helper(s1, s2);
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Memoization**: The `memo` map stores results of previously computed subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Helper Function**: The `helper` function recursively checks if `s1` and `s2` are scrambled versions of each other.
3. **Character Frequency Check**: Before making recursive calls, it checks if the sorted characters of `s1` and `s2` are equal.
4. **Recursive Splitting**: For each possible split index `i`, it checks both non-swapped and swapped cases of substrings recursively.
5. **Base Case Handling**: The function directly returns true if `s1` and `s2` are equal, and false if their sorted characters do not match.
