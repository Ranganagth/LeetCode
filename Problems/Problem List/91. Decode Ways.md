[91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)

# Intuition
The problem is about decoding a string of digits into possible letter combinations based on a given mapping, where 'A' is mapped to "1", 'B' to "2", ..., and 'Z' to "26". The goal is to count all possible ways to decode the string.

# Approach
We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently.

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0..i-1]`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` because there's one way to decode an empty string (by doing nothing).
   - If the first character `s[0]` is '0', then `dp[1] = 0` because a string starting with '0' cannot be decoded.

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - Iterate through the string from the second character to the end.
   - For each character at index `i`:
     - Check the one-digit number formed by `s[i-1]`. If it's between '1' and '9', it can be decoded independently, so add `dp[i-1]` to `dp[i]`.
     - Check the two-digit number formed by `s[i-2]` and `s[i-1]`. If it's between '10' and '26', it can also be decoded, so add `dp[i-2]` to `dp[i]`.

3. **Result**:
   - After iterating through the string, `dp[n]` (where `n` is the length of the string) will contain the number of ways to decode the entire string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string starts with '0' and cannot be decoded, the result is 0.
   - Handle strings of length 1 separately.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the `dp` array.

# Code
```typescript
function numDecodings(s: string): number {
    const n = s.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    
    const dp: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = s[0] === '0' ? 0 : 1;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        const oneDigit = parseInt(s[i - 1]);
        const twoDigits = parseInt(s.substring(i - 2, i));
        
        if (oneDigit >= 1 && oneDigit <= 9) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
        }
        
        if (twoDigits >= 10 && twoDigits <= 26) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};
