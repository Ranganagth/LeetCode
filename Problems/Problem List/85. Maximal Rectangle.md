[85. Maximal Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle/)

# Intuition
To find the largest rectangle of 1's in a binary matrix, we can utilize the concept of "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" within a 2D matrix context. This involves treating each row of the matrix as the base of a histogram, where each element in the row contributes to the height of the histogram.

# Approach
1. **Histogram Approach**:
   - For each row in the matrix, treat the row as the base of a histogram where each column represents the height of the histogram bars.
   - Calculate the height of the histogram bars for each column:
     - If the current element is '1', add to the current height.
     - If the current element is '0', reset the current height to zero.
   - Use the heights array derived from each row to apply the "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" algorithm to find the maximum area of rectangles that can be formed under the histogram.

2. **Largest Rectangle in Histogram Algorithm**:
   - This algorithm uses a stack to efficiently calculate the maximum area of rectangles. The stack helps maintain increasing heights and find the largest rectangle that can be formed ending at each bar.
   - Iterate through the heights array:
     - If the current height is greater than the height of the bar at the index stored in the stack, push the current index onto the stack.
     - If the current height is less than the height of the bar at the index stored in the stack, calculate the area using the height of the bar at the index popped from the stack as the shortest bar, and update the maximum area.
   - Continue this process until all heights have been processed.

3. **Calculate Maximum Area**:
   - For each row, calculate the largest rectangle area under the histogram using the "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" algorithm.
   - Keep track of the maximum area found across all rows.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m Ã— n)***, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are essentially running the "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" algorithm for each row.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of columns. This is due to the space used by the `heights` array and the stack.

# Code
```typescript
function maximalRectangle(matrix: string[][]): number {
    if (matrix.length === 0 || matrix[0].length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    const heights: number[] = Array(cols).fill(0);
    let maxArea = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            heights[j] = matrix[i][j] === '1' ? heights[j] + 1 : 0;
        }

        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, largestRectangleArea(heights));
    }

    return maxArea;
}

function largestRectangleArea(heights: number[]): number {
    const stack: number[] = [];
    let maxArea = 0;
    const n = heights.length;

    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && (i === n || heights[i] < heights[stack[stack.length - 1]])) {
            const height = heights[stack.pop()!];
            const width = stack.length === 0 ? i : i - stack[stack.length - 1] - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, height * width);
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return maxArea;
};
