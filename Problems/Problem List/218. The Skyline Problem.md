[218. The Skyline Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)

# Intuition

We want to simulate how the city's skyline would appear when viewed from a distance, given multiple buildings. Each building is a rectangle on a 2D plane. The skyline is made up of **key points**: these are x-positions where the height of the skyline changes.

To find the skyline:
* We track **entering and exiting events** of buildings.
* When a building **starts**, it might change the max height.
* When a building **ends**, the max height might drop.

To track the current max height efficiently, we can use a **max-heap** (priority queue). Every time we add or remove a height, we compare it with the previous max height. If it changes, we add a new key point.

# Approach

1. **Convert building data into events**:
   * Start event: `[x, -height]` (negative to ensure start events are processed before end events at the same `x`)
   * End event: `[x, height]`
2. **Sort events**:
   * By x coordinate
   * If same x:
     * Start before end
     * Higher height before lower (for starts), lower height before higher (for ends)
3. **Use a max-heap** to keep track of active buildings.
4. **Process events**:
   * On start: add height to heap
   * On end: remove height from heap
5. **Track changes**:
   * If current max height ≠ previous, add `[x, newHeight]` to result

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
  * For sorting events: `O(n log n)`
  * For heap operations: Each insert/remove is `O(log n)`, total `O(n log n)`

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for heap and events

# Code

```typescript
function getSkyline(buildings: number[][]): number[][] {
    const events: [number, number][] = [];

    for (const [left, right, height] of buildings) {
        events.push([left, -height]);  // Start of building
        events.push([right, height]);  // End of building
    }

    // Sort events
    events.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a[0] !== b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
        return a[1] - b[1];
    });

    const result: number[][] = [];
    const heights = new MaxHeap(); // Custom max heap
    heights.insert(0);
    let prevMax = 0;

    for (const [x, h] of events) {
        if (h < 0) {
            heights.insert(-h);  // entering building
        } else {
            heights.remove(h);   // exiting building
        }

        const currMax = heights.peek();
        if (currMax !== prevMax) {
            result.push([x, currMax]);
            prevMax = currMax;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Simple max-heap implementation
class MaxHeap {
    private heap: number[] = [];

    insert(val: number) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }

    remove(val: number) {
        const index = this.heap.indexOf(val);
        if (index === -1) return;
        const end = this.heap.pop()!;
        if (index < this.heap.length) {
            this.heap[index] = end;
            this.bubbleDown(index);
            this.bubbleUp(index);
        }
    }

    peek(): number {
        return this.heap[0] ?? 0;
    }

    private bubbleUp(i: number) {
        while (i > 0) {
            const parent = Math.floor((i - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[parent] >= this.heap[i]) break;
            [this.heap[i], this.heap[parent]] = [this.heap[parent], this.heap[i]];
            i = parent;
        }
    }

    private bubbleDown(i: number) {
        const n = this.heap.length;
        while (true) {
            let largest = i;
            const left = 2 * i + 1;
            const right = 2 * i + 2;

            if (left < n && this.heap[left] > this.heap[largest]) largest = left;
            if (right < n && this.heap[right] > this.heap[largest]) largest = right;
            if (largest === i) break;
            [this.heap[i], this.heap[largest]] = [this.heap[largest], this.heap[i]];
            i = largest;
        }
    }
};

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:

```ts
buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
```

#### Steps:

* Convert buildings into events:

  ```
  [2,-10], [9,10]
  [3,-15], [7,15]
  [5,-12], [12,12]
  [15,-10], [20,10]
  [19,-8], [24,8]
  ```
* Sort them:

  ```
  [2,-10], [3,-15], [5,-12], [7,15], [9,10], [12,12], [15,-10], [19,-8], [20,10], [24,8]
  ```
* Process with max-heap:

  ```
  x=2, insert 10 → max 10 → push [2,10]
  x=3, insert 15 → max 15 → push [3,15]
  x=5, insert 12 → max 15 → no change
  x=7, remove 15 → max 12 → push [7,12]
  x=9, remove 10 → max 12 → no change
  x=12, remove 12 → max 0 → push [12,0]
  x=15, insert 10 → max 10 → push [15,10]
  x=19, insert 8 → max 10 → no change
  x=20, remove 10 → max 8 → push [20,8]
  x=24, remove 8 → max 0 → push [24,0]
  ```

#### Output:

```ts
[[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
```

### **Summary**

This algorithm cleverly converts the building problem into a sequence of height events and uses a heap to maintain active heights. This makes it both efficient and scalable for large datasets.
