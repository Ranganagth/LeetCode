[337. House Robber III](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/)

# Intuition

For each node in the tree, we have two choices:
1. Rob this node and skip its children.
2. Do not rob this node and consider robbing its children.

We need to keep track of two states for each node:
- The maximum amount of money if we rob this node.
- The maximum amount of money if we do not rob this node.

# Approach

1. **Define a helper function** that returns a tuple `(rob, not_rob)`:
   - `rob` is the maximum amount of money that can be obtained by robbing the current node.
   - `not_rob` is the maximum amount of money that can be obtained without robbing the current node.

2. **Recursively traverse the tree**:
   - For each node, compute the values of `rob` and `not_rob`:
     - `rob` = value of the current node + `not_rob` of its left child + `not_rob` of its right child.
     - `not_rob` = maximum of `rob` and `not_rob` of its left child + maximum of `rob` and `not_rob` of its right child.

3. **Return the maximum value** of robbing or not robbing the root node.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function rob(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    function helper(node: TreeNode | null): [number, number] {
        if (node === null) return [0, 0];

        const [leftRob, leftNotRob] = helper(node.left);
        const [rightRob, rightNotRob] = helper(node.right);

        const rob = node.val + leftNotRob + rightNotRob;
        const notRob = Math.max(leftRob, leftNotRob) + Math.max(rightRob, rightNotRob);

        return [rob, notRob];
    }

    const [robRoot, notRobRoot] = helper(root);
    return Math.max(robRoot, notRobRoot);
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TreeNode Class**: A basic binary tree node class is defined.
2. **rob Function**: The main function that initiates the recursive helper function.
3. **helper Function**: This function does the actual computation using recursion. It returns a tuple `[rob, notRob]` for each node.
4. **Recursive Calculation**: For each node, calculate the maximum money that can be robbed if we rob this node or if we do not rob this node.
5. **Return the Result**: The maximum of the two states for the root node gives the result.
