[389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

# Intuition

To identify the extra character in string `t` compared to string `s`, we can leverage the properties of the XOR bitwise operation. The XOR operation has the following key properties:

1. **a ⊕ a = 0**: XORing a number with itself results in zero.
2. **a ⊕ 0 = a**: XORing a number with zero results in the number itself.
3. XOR is commutative and associative, which means the order of applying XOR does not matter.

Given these properties, if we XOR all characters in `s` and `t`, every character that appears in both strings will cancel out **(since a ⊕ a = 0)**. The remaining result will be the character that appears only in `t`.

# Approach

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. XOR all characters in `s` with the `result`.
3. XOR all characters in `t` with the `result`.
4. The final value of `result` will be the extra character added to `t`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the longer string `t`. We iterate over each character of both strings exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a single variable to store the XOR result.

# Code

```typescript
function findTheDifference(s: string, t: string): string {
    let result = 0;

    for (const char of s) {
        result ^= char.charCodeAt(0);
    }

    for (const char of t) {
        result ^= char.charCodeAt(0);
    }

    return String.fromCharCode(result);
};

```

## Example usage

```typescript
console.log(findTheDifference("abcd", "abcde")); // Output: "e"
console.log(findTheDifference("", "y"));         // Output: "y"
```

### Explanation of Examples

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `s = "abcd"`, `t = "abcde"`
   - XOR all characters in `s`: **a ⊕ b ⊕ c ⊕ d**
   - XOR all characters in `t`: **a ⊕ b ⊕ c ⊕ d ⊕ e**
   - Since all characters from `s` cancel out, the result is `e`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `s = ""`, `t = "y"`
   - XOR all characters in `s`: (none)
   - XOR all characters in `t`: `y`
   - Since there are no characters in `s` to cancel out, the result is `y`.
