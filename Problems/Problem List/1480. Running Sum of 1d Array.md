[1480. Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

# Intuition

The running sum of an array is a common problem that can be efficiently solved using a single pass through the array. The idea is to maintain a cumulative sum as we iterate through the array and store this cumulative sum at each index.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a new array `runningSum` with the same length as the input `nums`.
   - Initialize the first element of `runningSum` to be the same as the first element of `nums` since the running sum at the first index is just the first element itself.

2. **Iterate and Accumulate**:
   - Iterate through the `nums` array starting from the second element (index 1).
   - For each element, add the current element of `nums` to the running sum of the previous element and store it in the current index of `runningSum`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After the loop completes, `runningSum` will contain the running sum of the array `nums`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the input array `nums`. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the running sum array.

# Code
```typescript
function runningSum(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const runningSum: number[] = new Array(nums.length);
    runningSum[0] = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        runningSum[i] = runningSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
    }

    return runningSum;
};

```
