[1232. Check If It Is a Straight Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-it-is-a-straight-line/)

# Intuition

To determine if a series of points on an XY plane form a straight line, we need to check if the slope between every consecutive pair of points is the same. The slope between two points **(x₁, y₁)** and **(x₂, y₂)** is calculated as:

`slope = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)`

If the slope between every consecutive pair of points is consistent, then the points lie on the same straight line.

# Approach

1. **Initial Slope Calculation**:
   - Calculate the slope between the first two points.
  
2. **Slope Comparison**:
   - For every subsequent point, calculate the slope between that point and the first point, and compare it with the initial slope.
   - Since dividing by zero can be problematic (if the line is vertical), instead of comparing the slopes directly, compare the cross product to avoid division:
`(y₂ - y₁) × (x₃ - x₁) = (y₃ - y₁) × (x₂ - x₁)`

3. **Consistency Check**:
   - If the above condition holds true for every point, the points form a straight line.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of points. We iterate through the list once to compare slopes.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a few variables for calculations.

# Code

```typescript
function checkStraightLine(coordinates: number[][]): boolean {
    const [x1, y1] = coordinates[0];
    const [x2, y2] = coordinates[1];
    
    const initialDeltaX = x2 - x1;
    const initialDeltaY = y2 - y1;

    for (let i = 2; i < coordinates.length; i++) {
        const [x, y] = coordinates[i];
        const deltaX = x - x1;
        const deltaY = y - y1;

        if (initialDeltaY * deltaX !== initialDeltaX * deltaY) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Extract the first two points and calculate the differences in *x* and *y* coordinates, which define the slope.

2. **Iterating through Points**:
   - For each subsequent point, calculate the differences relative to the first point.
   - Check if the cross product of differences equals zero, which would indicate consistent slopes, meaning the points lie on the same straight line.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If all points satisfy the condition, the function returns `true`, otherwise `false`.
