[131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

# Intuition
The problem is to partition a given string `s` such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome. We need to find all possible partitions that satisfy this condition. This can be effectively solved using backtracking, where we recursively explore all possible partitions and check for palindromes.

# Approach
1. **Palindrome Check**: We create a helper function `isPalindrome` to check if a given substring is a palindrome.
2. **Backtracking**: We use a recursive backtracking function `backtrack` to explore all possible partitions:
   - If the starting index `start` reaches the length of the string, it means we have found a valid partition, and we add the current partition to the result.
   - Otherwise, we iterate through the end index from the starting index to the end of the string, and for each substring, we check if it's a palindrome.
   - If it is, we add this substring to the current partition and recursively call the backtracking function with the next starting index.
   - After exploring with the current substring, we remove it (backtrack) and continue to explore other possibilities.
   
# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is ***O(2ⁿ ⋅ n)*** where *n* is the length of the string. This is because there are *2ⁿ* possible partitions and checking each partition takes *O(n)* time.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(n)*** for the recursion stack and the space used to store the partitions.

# Code
```typescript
function partition(s: string): string[][] {
    const result: string[][] = [];

    const isPalindrome = (str: string, left: number, right: number): boolean => {
        while (left < right) {
            if (str[left] !== str[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    };

    const backtrack = (start: number, currentPartition: string[]) => {
        if (start === s.length) {
            result.push([...currentPartition]);
            return;
        }

        for (let end = start; end < s.length; end++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, end)) {
                currentPartition.push(s.substring(start, end + 1));
                backtrack(end + 1, currentPartition);
                currentPartition.pop();
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack(0, []);

    return result;
};
