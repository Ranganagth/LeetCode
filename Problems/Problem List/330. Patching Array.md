[330. Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/)

### Problem Summary

You're given a sorted integer array `nums` and a target `n`. You need to ensure **every number from 1 to n** can be represented as a **sum of some elements from `nums`**. You're allowed to **add (patch) new numbers** to `nums`, and the goal is to return the **minimum number of such patches** required.

---

# Intuition

We use a greedy strategy:
Let’s track a running variable `miss` which denotes the **smallest number in \[1, n]** that **cannot yet be formed** with the current set of numbers.

If we can already form all numbers in `[1, miss)`, and the current number in `nums` is ≤ `miss`, we can extend our reachable range up to `miss + nums[i]`.

If the current number is **greater than `miss`**, we have a gap in coverage — we need to patch `miss` itself to fill the gap.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize:
   * `miss = 1`: the smallest number we can't form yet.
   * `i = 0`: index for iterating through `nums`.
   * `patches = 0`: number of added elements.

2. While `miss <= n`:
   * If `i < nums.length` and `nums[i] <= miss`, it means we can use `nums[i]` to extend our reach:
     * Update `miss += nums[i]`
     * Move to the next element `i++`
   * Else, we must **patch** by adding `miss`:
     * This allows us to cover up to `2 * miss - 1`
     * Update `miss *= 2`, and increment `patches++`

3. Return `patches`

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(log n + nums.length)`
  Every patch doubles the coverage range, so at most `log n` patches.
  We also iterate through each element of `nums` once.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — Constant extra space.

---

# Code

```ts
function minPatches(nums: number[], n: number): number {
    let miss = 1;
    let patches = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (miss <= n) {
        if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= miss) {
            miss += nums[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            miss += miss;
            patches++;
        }
    }

    return patches;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

Input: `nums = [1, 3], n = 6`

* `miss = 1`, nums\[0] = 1 → we use 1 → miss becomes 2
* `miss = 2`, nums\[1] = 3 > miss → patch 2 → miss becomes 4
* `miss = 4`, nums\[1] = 3 ≤ miss → use 3 → miss becomes 7

Now `miss = 7 > n`, done.
**Answer: 1 patch**

---

#### **Example 2**

Input: `nums = [1, 5, 10], n = 20`

* `miss = 1`, use 1 → miss = 2
* `miss = 2`, patch 2 → miss = 4
* `miss = 4`, patch 4 → miss = 8
* `miss = 8`, use 5 → miss = 13
* `miss = 13`, use 10 → miss = 23

Now `miss = 23 > 20`, done.
**Answer: 2 patches**

---

### **Summary**

This greedy algorithm smartly adds the smallest unreachable number as a patch, maximizing each step's gain. It avoids unnecessary additions and ensures minimal patching with optimal time complexity.
