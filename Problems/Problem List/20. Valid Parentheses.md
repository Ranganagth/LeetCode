[20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

# Intuition
To determine if a string containing only parentheses is valid, we can use a stack-based approach. This allows us to ensure that every opening parenthesis has a corresponding and correctly ordered closing parenthesis.

# Approach
1. **Stack Data Structure:** Utilize a stack to keep track of opening parentheses.
2. **Iterate through the string:** Traverse each character in the string.
   - If the character is an opening parenthesis (`'('`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing parenthesis (`')'`, `}`, `]`):
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `false` because there's no corresponding opening parenthesis.
     - Pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing parenthesis.
       - If they do not match (i.e., they are not of the same type), return `false`.
3. **Final Check:** After iterating through all characters, ensure that the stack is empty.
   - If the stack is empty, return `true` because all parentheses have been properly matched.
   - If the stack is not empty, return `false` because there are unmatched opening parentheses.

# Explanation
- We use a stack to keep track of opening parentheses.
- As we iterate through the string:
  - If we encounter an opening parenthesis, we push it onto the stack.
  - If we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check the top of the stack:
    - If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current closing parenthesis, we return `false`.
    - Otherwise, we pop the top of the stack.
- After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, all parentheses are properly matched, and we return `true`.
- If there are unmatched opening parentheses left in the stack, we return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where **n** is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(n)***. The space complexity is determined by the stack usage in the worst case, where all characters could be opening parentheses.

# Code
```typescript
function isValid(s: string): boolean {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    const map: { [key: string]: string } = {
        "(": ")",
        "{": "}",
        "[": "]"
    };
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char in map) {
            stack.push(char);
        } else {
            const last = stack.pop();
            if (char !== map[last]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0;
};
```
