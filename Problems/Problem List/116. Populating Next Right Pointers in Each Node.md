[116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/)

# Intuition

You are given a perfect binary tree, which means all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. You need to populate each node's `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `null`.

### Example

Given the following perfect binary tree:
```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \   / \
   4   5 6   7
```
After populating the `next` pointers, it should look like this:
```
        1 -> null
      /   \
     2 -> 3 -> null
    / \   / \
   4->5->6->7 -> null
```

# Approach

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Breadth-First Search (Level Order Traversal)**:
   - Perform a level order traversal using a queue.
   - For each level, connect all nodes using the `next` pointers.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Start from the root node.
   - Initialize a queue to store nodes for the level order traversal.
   - For each level:
     - Dequeue nodes one by one and set their `next` pointers.
     - Enqueue the children of each node if they exist.
   - Continue this until all levels are processed.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, due to the queue used for the level order traversal. In the worst case, the queue can contain all nodes at the maximum width of the tree.

# Code
```typescript
/**
 * Definition for a Node.
 */
class Node {
    val: number
    left: Node | null
    right: Node | null
    next: Node | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: Node | null, right?: Node | null, next?: Node | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
    }
}

function connect(root: Node | null): Node | null {
    if (!root) return null;
    
    let queue: Node[] = [root];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift()!;
            
            if (i < size - 1) {
                node.next = queue[0];
            } else {
                node.next = null;
            }
            
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
    }
    
    return root;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Node Definition**:
   - The `Node` class is defined with `val`, `left`, `right`, and `next` properties.

2. **connect Function**:
   - Start by checking if the `root` exists. If not, return `null`.
   - Initialize a queue with the `root`.
   - Perform a level order traversal using the queue.
   - For each node in the queue:
     - Set its `next` pointer to the next node in the queue (or `null` if it's the last node in the level).
     - Enqueue its left and right children if they exist.
   - Once the traversal is complete, return the `root`.
