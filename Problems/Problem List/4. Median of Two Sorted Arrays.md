[4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the median of two sorted arrays with a time complexity of \(O(\log(m+n))\). This suggests a binary search approach. By partitioning the arrays and adjusting the partitions using binary search, we can efficiently find the median without merging the arrays.

# Approach
1. Ensure that `nums1` is the smaller array to minimize the binary search range.
2. Initialize the binary search range on the smaller array.
3. Calculate partitions for both arrays such that the left partitions contain half of the total elements.
4. Check if the current partitions satisfy the condition where all elements in the left partitions are less than or equal to all elements in the right partitions.
5. If the condition is satisfied, compute the median based on whether the combined array length is even or odd.
6. If the condition is not satisfied, adjust the binary search range and continue.
7. Handle edge cases by using negative and positive infinity to represent out-of-bounds elements.

# Explanation
- We use binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition.
- For each partition of the smaller array, we compute the corresponding partition in the larger array.
- We then compare the maximum element of the left partitions with the minimum element of the right partitions to determine if the partitions are correct.
- If the partitions are correct, we calculate the median:
  - If the total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the maximum of the left partitions and the minimum of the right partitions.
  - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the maximum of the left partitions.
- If the partitions are not correct, we adjust the binary search range and repeat.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(log(min(m, n)))***
  - The binary search operates on the smaller array, resulting in logarithmic time complexity with respect to the size of the smaller array.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function findMedianSortedArrays(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
    if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
        [nums1, nums2] = [nums2, nums1];
    }
    const m = nums1.length;
    const n = nums2.length;
    const totalLength = m + n;
    const isEven = totalLength % 2 === 0;

    let left = 0;
    let right = m;
    let partition1 = 0;
    let partition2 = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        partition1 = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        partition2 = Math.floor((totalLength + 1) / 2) - partition1;

        const maxLeft1 = partition1 === 0 ? Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER : nums1[partition1 - 1];
        const minRight1 = partition1 === m ? Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER : nums1[partition1];

        const maxLeft2 = partition2 === 0 ? Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER : nums2[partition2 - 1];
        const minRight2 = partition2 === n ? Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER : nums2[partition2];

        if (maxLeft1 <= minRight2 && maxLeft2 <= minRight1) {
            if (isEven) {
                return (Math.max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2) + Math.min(minRight1, minRight2)) / 2;
            } else {
                return Math.max(maxLeft1, maxLeft2);
            }
        } else if (maxLeft1 > minRight2) {
            right = partition1 - 1;
        } else {
            left = partition1 + 1;
        }
    }

    throw new Error("Invalid inputs");
};
