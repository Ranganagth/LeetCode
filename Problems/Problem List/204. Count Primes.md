[204. Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/)

# Intuition

To count the number of prime numbers less than a given integer `n`, we can use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** algorithm, which is an efficient way to find all primes smaller than a given limit. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a boolean array `isPrime` of size `n`, initialized to `true`. This array will help in marking non-prime numbers.
   - Set `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` to `false` because 0 and 1 are not primes.

2. **Sieve Process**:
   - Iterate from `2` to `sqrt(n)`. For each number `i`:
     - If `i` is still marked as prime (`isPrime[i]` is `true`), mark all multiples of `i` (starting from `i*i`) as `false` because they are not prime.

3. **Counting Primes**:
   - After the sieve process, count the number of `true` values in the `isPrime` array, which represent the prime numbers.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log log n)***. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is very efficient for this purpose.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***. We use an array of size `n` to keep track of prime numbers.

# Code
```typescript
function countPrimes(n: number): number {
    if (n <= 2) return 0;
    
    const isPrime: boolean[] = new Array(n).fill(true);
    isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

    for (let i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
        if (isPrime[i]) {
            for (let j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
                isPrime[j] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    return isPrime.reduce((count, prime) => count + (prime ? 1 : 0), 0);
};


```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n <= 2`, return `0` since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Boolean Array Initialization**:
   - Create an array `isPrime` of size `n`, initialized to `true`.
   - Set `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` to `false` because 0 and 1 are not primes.

3. **Mark Non-Prime Numbers**:
   - For each number `i` starting from 2, if `i` is prime (`isPrime[i]` is `true`), mark all multiples of `i` as non-prime starting from `i*i`.

4. **Count Primes**:
   - Use the `reduce` method to count the number of `true` values in the `isPrime` array.
