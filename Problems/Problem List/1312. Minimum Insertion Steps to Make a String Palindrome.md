[1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertion-steps-to-make-a-string-palindrome/)

# Intuition

To make a string a palindrome by inserting the minimum number of characters, we can think about how to find the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in the string. If we know the length of the LPS, the minimum number of insertions required to make the string a palindrome is the difference between the length of the string and the length of the LPS.

# Approach

1. **Find the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)**:
   - Use dynamic programming to find the LPS. The idea is to find the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) between the string and its reverse.
   
2. **Calculate Minimum Insertions**:
   - The minimum number of insertions required is the length of the string minus the length of the LPS.
   
3. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Define a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LPS within the substring `s[i...j]`.
   - Initialize the table for substrings of length 1 (each character is a palindrome of length 1).
   - Fill the table using the following relations:
     - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n²)***, where *n* is the length of the string. We are filling up an *n × n* DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** for the DP table.

# Code
```typescript
function minInsertions(s: string): number {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
    }

    for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            const j = i + len - 1;
            if (s[i] === s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    const lps = dp[0][n - 1];
    return n - lps;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize a 2D DP array where `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`, because a single character is always a palindrome of length 1.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - We iterate over all possible substring lengths starting from 2.
   - For each length, we iterate over all possible starting indices and compute the value of `dp[i][j]`.
   - If the characters at the current substring's boundaries are equal (`s[i] == s[j]`), we add 2 to the value of `dp[i + 1][j - 1]`.
   - If they are not equal, we take the maximum value from either ignoring the current starting character (`dp[i + 1][j]`) or the ending character (`dp[i][j - 1]`).

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The length of the LPS is stored in `dp[0][n - 1]`.
   - The minimum number of insertions needed is the difference between the length of the string and the length of the LPS.
