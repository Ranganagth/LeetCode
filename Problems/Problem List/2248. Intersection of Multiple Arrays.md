[2248. Intersection of Multiple Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-multiple-arrays/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to find the common integers present in each sub-array of a 2D array and return these integers sorted in ascending order. The most straightforward approach is to use a hash map (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each integer across all sub-arrays and then identify those integers that appear in every sub-array.

# Approach

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map to count the frequency of each integer across all sub-arrays.
2. **Identify Common Integers**: Iterate through the hash map to find integers whose frequency matches the number of sub-arrays.
3. **Sort the Result**: Sort the resulting list of common integers in ascending order.

### Steps:
1. Create an empty hash map to store the frequency of each integer.
2. Iterate through each sub-array in the 2D array.
3. For each integer in the sub-array, update its count in the hash map.
4. After populating the hash map, iterate through it to find integers that appear in all sub-arrays.
5. Sort the list of common integers in ascending order.
6. Return the sorted list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n * m + k log k)***, where n is the number of sub-arrays, m is the average length of each sub-array, and k is the number of common elements. This accounts for counting the elements and sorting the final list.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, where m is the total number of unique integers across all sub-arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function intersection(nums: number[][]): number[] {
    const map: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    const numArrays = nums.length;

    for (const arr of nums) {
        for (const num of arr) {
            map.set(num, (map.get(num) || 0) + 1);
        }
    }

    const result: number[] = [];
    for (const [num, count] of map.entries()) {
        if (count === numArrays) {
            result.push(num);
        }
    }

    result.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    return result;
};

```
## Follow-up Considerations

1. **Handling Large Arrays or Memory Constraints**: If the input arrays are very large or stored on disk, we could use a streaming approach or process the data in chunks to minimize memory usage.
2. **Optimizing for Sorted Arrays**: If the sub-arrays are already sorted, we can use a more efficient method like merge-like processing to find the intersection.
3. **Reducing Space Complexity**: If space is a concern, consider using a set for each sub-array and finding intersections iteratively to avoid storing all elements at once.
