[740. Delete and Earn](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

# Intuition

Given the constraints, a direct approach would be inefficient. Instead, we can:
1. **Count the frequency** of each number in the array.
2. **Transform the problem** into a dynamic programming problem similar to the "House Robber" problem:
   - If we take a number *x*, we cannot take *x-1* and *x+1*.
   - We need to decide for each number whether to take it and add its points or skip it to maximize the total points.

# Approach

1. **Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a DP array where `dp[x]` represents the maximum points that can be earned considering numbers from 0 to *x*.
3. **Transition**: For each number *x*:
   - If we take *x*, we add *x Ã— count(x)* to the maximum points that can be earned without taking *x-1*.
   - If we don't take *x*, the maximum points are just the maximum points considering numbers up to *x-1*.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where *n* is the length of the input array and *m* is the range of numbers (maximum value in nums).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, for storing the frequency and the DP array.

# Code
```typescript
function deleteAndEarn(nums: number[]): number {
    const maxNum = Math.max(...nums);
    const count = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);

    for (const num of nums) {
        count[num] += num;
    }

    const dp = new Array(maxNum + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = count[1];

    for (let i = 2; i <= maxNum; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + count[i]);
    }

    return dp[maxNum];
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Map**: We first count how many points each unique number contributes.
2. **DP Array**:
   - `dp[0]` is 0 since there's nothing to take.
   - `dp[1]` is the points contributed by 1.
   - For each number *i* from 2 to the maximum number:
     - We decide whether to take *i* (i.e., `dp[i-2] + count[i]`) or skip *i* (i.e., `dp[i-1]`).
3. **Result**: The value at `dp[maxNum]` gives the maximum points we can earn.
