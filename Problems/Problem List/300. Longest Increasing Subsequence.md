[300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

# Intuition

We maintain a **dynamic list `sub`**, where:

* `sub[i]` holds the **smallest possible tail** value of an increasing subsequence of length `i + 1`.
* As we iterate, we use **binary search** to find the correct position to update in `sub`.

This way, the `sub` list is not the actual subsequence, but its **length** represents the **length of the LIS**.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize an empty array `sub`.
2. Iterate through each number `num` in `nums`.
3. Use binary search to find the **index `i`** in `sub` such that `sub[i] >= num`.

   * If such index exists → replace `sub[i]` with `num` (we want the smallest tail).
   * If not → push `num` to `sub` (we found a longer subsequence).
4. Finally, the length of `sub` is our answer.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n log n) due to binary search in each iteration.
* **Space:** O(n) for storing the subsequence tails.

# Code

```ts
function lengthOfLIS(nums: number[]): number {
    const sub: number[] = [];

    for (const num of nums) {
        let left = 0, right = sub.length;

        // Binary search for the smallest number >= num
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (sub[mid] < num) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        if (left < sub.length) {
            sub[left] = num;
        } else {
            sub.push(num);
        }
    }

    return sub.length;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

Input: `[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`

* Step-by-step sub updates:

  * `2` → \[2]
  * `5` → \[2, 5]
  * `3` → \[2, 3]
  * `7` → \[2, 3, 7]
  * `101` → \[2, 3, 7, 101]
  * `18` replaces 101 → \[2, 3, 7, 18]

Length = 4 → Output: `4`

#### Example 2:

Input: `[0,1,0,3,2,3]`

* Final sub: \[0, 1, 2, 3]
* Output: `4`

#### Example 3:

Input: `[7,7,7,7,7]`

* Only one increasing element → Output: `1`

### **Summary**

This solution uses binary search to optimize LIS computation, achieving the desired `O(n log n)` complexity. It’s a powerful technique that is often used in competitive programming and advanced algorithmic interviews.
