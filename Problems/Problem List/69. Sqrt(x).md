[69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

# Intuition

To find the square root of a non-negative integer `x` rounded down to the nearest integer without using any built-in exponent functions or operators, we can use a binary search approach. This is an efficient method that operates in O(log x) time complexity.

# Approach

1. **Binary Search Method**:
   - We will use binary search to find the integer square root of `x`.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`. `left` starts at 0 and `right` starts at `x`.
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid` between `left` and `right`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x`, then it's a potential candidate for the square root.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, move `right` to `mid - 1`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than or equal to `x`, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - Continue until `left` is greater than `right`.

2. **Result**:
   - The value of `right` will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, which is our desired integer square root.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log x)*** - Binary search reduces the search space by half at each step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** - Only a constant amount of extra space is used.

# Code
```typescript
function mySqrt(x: number): number {
    if (x === 0) return 0;
    
    let left = 1;
    let right = x;
    let result = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);
        if (mid <= x / mid) {
            result = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

- We handle the special case where `x` is 0 by directly returning 0 since the square root of 0 is 0.
- Initialize `left` to 1 and `right` to `x`, and `result` to 0. This sets up our binary search range.
- Use binary search to find the largest integer `result` such that `result * result` is less than or equal to `x`.
- Adjust `left` and `right` based on whether the square of `mid` is greater or less than `x`.
- Once `left` is greater than `right`, `right` will hold the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, which is returned as the integer square root.
