[275. H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)

### Problem Summary

Given a sorted array `citations` (non-decreasing order), where each element represents the number of citations for a research paper, compute the **h-index**.

### H-Index Definition

> The h-index is the **maximum number `h`** such that the researcher has **at least `h` papers** with **at least `h` citations** each.

---

# Intuition

We are given that the `citations` array is sorted in ascending order. This allows us to use **binary search** to find the h-index in **O(log n)** time.

Let `n` be the total number of papers. 

Suppose we are at index `i` in the array. Then the number of papers with at least `citations[i]` citations is `n - i`.

We want to find the **smallest index `i`** such that:

```
citations[i] >= n - i
```

Then, the h-index would be `n - i`.

---

# Approach

1. Use binary search on the `citations` array.
2. At each index `mid`, check if `citations[mid] >= n - mid`.
   - If yes, move `right` to `mid` to find a potentially smaller valid index.
   - If not, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
3. After the loop, return `n - left`.

---
# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` — Binary search
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — No extra space used

---

# Code

```ts
function hIndex(citations: number[]): number {
    let n = citations.length;
    let left = 0, right = n;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (citations[mid] >= n - mid) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return n - left;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:
`citations = [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]`  
`n = 5`

- Try to find smallest index where `citations[i] >= n - i`

| i   | citations[i] | n - i | Condition           |
| --- | ------------ | ----- | ------------------- |
| 0   | 0            | 5     | 0 < 5               |
| 1   | 1            | 4     | 1 < 4               |
| 2   | 3            | 3     | 3 ≥ 3 ← first match |
→ h-index = `n - 2 = 3`

**Output:** `3`

---

### **Summary**

- The problem requires finding the max `h` such that there are `h` papers with at least `h` citations.
- Since the array is sorted, binary search helps efficiently locate the smallest index where this condition is met.
- The final result is `n - index`.
