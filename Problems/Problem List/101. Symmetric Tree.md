[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

To determine whether a binary tree is symmetric around its center, we can approach this problem both recursively and iteratively.

### Recursive Approach

# Intuition:
- A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree.
- This implies that:
  - The left subtree of the left child is a mirror reflection of the right subtree of the right child.
  - The right subtree of the left child is a mirror reflection of the left subtree of the right child.

# Approach:
1. Write a helper function `isMirror` to compare two trees.
2. Compare the root's left and right children using `isMirror`.
3. Recursively check the above conditions for the subtrees.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function isSymmetric(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!root) return true;

    function isMirror(t1: TreeNode | null, t2: TreeNode | null): boolean {
        if (!t1 && !t2) return true;
        if (!t1 || !t2) return false;
        return (t1.val === t2.val)
            && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right)
            && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left);
    }

    return isMirror(root.left, root.right);
};

```

### Iterative Approach

# Intuition:
- Use a queue to iteratively check if the tree is symmetric.
- Enqueue the left and right children of the root.
- Dequeue nodes in pairs and check if they are mirror reflections.

# Approach:
1. Use a queue to store nodes in pairs.
2. Enqueue the left and right children of the root.
3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue two nodes and compare them.
4. If they are not equal, return false.
5. Enqueue their children in the order that maintains the mirror property.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)***, for storing nodes in the queue.

# Code:
```typescript
function isSymmetricIterative(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!root) return true;

    const queue: (TreeNode | null)[] = [];
    queue.push(root.left);
    queue.push(root.right);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const t1 = queue.shift();
        const t2 = queue.shift();

        if (!t1 && !t2) continue;
        if (!t1 || !t2) return false;
        if (t1.val !== t2.val) return false;

        queue.push(t1.left);
        queue.push(t2.right);
        queue.push(t1.right);
        queue.push(t2.left);
    }

    return true;
};

```

Both approaches effectively determine whether the binary tree is symmetric. The recursive method is straightforward and leverages the natural recursive structure of trees, while the iterative method uses a queue to achieve the same result without recursion.
