[438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

# Intuition

An anagram of a string is another string with the same characters but in a different order. Therefore, two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts are identical.

# Approach

1. **Frequency Count**: 
   - Use two frequency arrays or hash maps: one for the target string `p` and one for the current window in `s`.
   
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Start with the first `p.length` characters of `s` and populate the frequency count for this window.
   - Slide the window one character at a time from the start of `s` to the end. For each new character added to the window, remove the character that is left behind.
   - After adjusting the window, compare the frequency array of the window with that of `p`. If they match, it means the current window is an anagram of `p`.

3. **Store Results**:
   - If the frequency counts match, store the starting index of the current window.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of `s`. Each character is added and removed from the window exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since the frequency count arrays are of fixed size (26 for lowercase English letters).

# Code
```typescript
function findAnagrams(s: string, p: string): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    const pLen = p.length, sLen = s.length;
    if (sLen < pLen) return result;

    const pCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const sCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < pLen; i++) {
        pCount[p.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
        sCount[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
    }

    if (arraysEqual(pCount, sCount)) result.push(0);

    for (let i = pLen; i < sLen; i++) {
        sCount[s.charCodeAt(i) - 97]++;
        sCount[s.charCodeAt(i - pLen) - 97]--;
        
        if (arraysEqual(pCount, sCount)) {
            result.push(i - pLen + 1);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

function arraysEqual(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): boolean {
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false;
    }
    return true;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Frequency Count Arrays**: 
  - `pCount` and `sCount` are used to store the frequency of each character (from 'a' to 'z') in `p` and the current window of `s`, respectively.
  
- **Initial Window Setup**: 
  - The first loop initializes the frequency counts for the first `pLen` characters of `s`.

- **Sliding Window Process**:
  - As we slide the window across `s`, we update `sCount` by adding the new character and removing the old character that is no longer in the window.
  - After each update, we check if the current window's frequency matches `p`'s frequency using the helper function `arraysEqual`.

- **arraysEqual Function**:
  - This helper function checks if two arrays of size 26 (representing the frequency of each character) are identical.
