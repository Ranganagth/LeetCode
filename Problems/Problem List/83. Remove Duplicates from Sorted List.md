[83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

# Intuition
Given a sorted linked list, our goal is to remove all duplicate nodes such that each element appears only once. Since the list is sorted, all duplicates are adjacent, making it easier to identify and remove them in one pass through the list.

# Approach
1. **Iterate through the List**: We start from the head of the linked list and traverse through each node.
2. **Check for Duplicates**: For each node, we compare its value with the next node's value.
3. **Remove Duplicates**: If the current node's value is the same as the next node's value, we skip the next node by adjusting the current node's next pointer to point to the next-next node.
4. **Continue Traversing**: If no duplicate is found, we simply move to the next node and repeat the process.
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases where the list might be empty or contain only one node.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We only need to traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are not using any extra space that grows with the input size, just a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
function deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (head === null || head.next === null) {
        return head;
    }

    let current: ListNode | null = head;

    while (current !== null && current.next !== null) {
        if (current.val === current.next.val) {
            current.next = current.next.next;
        } else {
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    return head;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We handle edge cases by checking if the list is empty or contains only one node.
2. **Traversal**: We use a `current` pointer to iterate through the list.
3. **Duplicate Removal**:
   - When a duplicate is found (i.e., `current.val` is equal to `current.next.val`), we skip the next node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
   - If no duplicate is found, we simply move the `current` pointer to the next node.
4. **Return**: After processing the entire list, we return the head of the modified list.
