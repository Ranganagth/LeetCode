[1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-salary-excluding-the-minimum-and-maximum-salary/)

# Intuition

To calculate the average salary excluding the minimum and maximum salary, we can directly sum the salaries and then exclude the minimum and maximum values from the total sum. After removing these values, the remaining sum can be divided by the number of remaining elements to get the desired average.

# Approach

1. **Find the Minimum and Maximum Salary**: Traverse the array to find the minimum and maximum salaries.
2. **Sum the Salaries**: Calculate the sum of all salaries in the array.
3. **Calculate the Average**: Subtract the minimum and maximum salaries from the total sum, and then divide by the number of remaining elements (i.e., `n - 2` where `n` is the length of the array).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** - We iterate through the array to find the minimum, maximum, and sum.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function average(salary: number[]): number {
    let minSalary = Math.min(...salary);
    let maxSalary = Math.max(...salary);
    let totalSum = salary.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s, 0);
    
    return (totalSum - minSalary - maxSalary) / (salary.length - 2);
}
```

### Explanation

- **Math.min(...salary)**: Finds the minimum salary in the array.
- **Math.max(...salary)**: Finds the maximum salary in the array.
- **salary.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s, 0)**: Sums up all the salaries in the array.
- **(totalSum - minSalary - maxSalary) / (salary.length - 2)**: Subtracts the minimum and maximum salaries from the total sum and divides by the number of remaining elements to get the average.
