[76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)

# Intuition
To solve the problem of finding the minimum window substring that contains all characters of another string `t`, we can use the sliding window approach. The idea is to expand and contract a window over the string `s` to find the smallest substring that contains all the characters in `t`.

# Approach
1. **Frequency Arrays**:
   - Use two frequency arrays: one for the characters in `t` (`tFreq`) and another for the current window in `s` (`sFreq`).
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Initialize pointers `left` and `right` to represent the window's bounds.
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and include characters from `s` into `sFreq`.
   - When a valid window (contains all characters from `t`) is found, try to contract the window from the left to find the minimum window.
3. **Update Minimum Window**:
   - Each time a valid window is found, update the minimum length and starting position if this window is smaller than previously found windows.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `t` has characters not present in `s`, return an empty string.
   - If `s` or `t` is empty, handle these cases appropriately.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(m + n)*** where *m* is the length of `s` and *n* is the length of `t`. This is because each character in `s` is processed at most twice (once when the `right` pointer expands and once when the `left` pointer contracts).
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)*** as the frequency arrays have a constant size of 128 (number of ASCII characters).

# Code
```typescript
function minWindow(s: string, t: string): string {
    const sFreq: number[] = new Array(128).fill(0);
    const tFreq: number[] = new Array(128).fill(0);
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let minLength = Infinity;
    let minStart = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
        tFreq[t.charCodeAt(i)]++;
    }

    while (right < s.length) {
        if (tFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)] > 0) {
            sFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)]++;
            if (sFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)] <= tFreq[s.charCodeAt(right)]) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        while (count === t.length) {
            if (right - left + 1 < minLength) {
                minLength = right - left + 1;
                minStart = left;
            }
            if (tFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)] > 0) {
                sFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)]--;
                if (sFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)] < tFreq[s.charCodeAt(left)]) {
                    count--;
                }
            }
            left++;
        }

        right++;
    }

    return minLength === Infinity ? "" : s.substring(minStart, minStart + minLength);
};
