[27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/)

To solve the problem of removing all occurrences of a given value `val` from an array `nums` in-place and returning the new length of the array without `val`, we can use a two-pointer technique. This approach ensures that we can efficiently move elements that are not equal to `val` to the front of the array, while ignoring the values equal to `val`.

# Approach:
1. **Initialize a Pointer**: Use a pointer `k` to track the position where the next non-val element should be placed.
2. **Traverse the Array**: Iterate through the array with another pointer `i`.
3. **Check Each Element**: For each element in the array, if it is not equal to `val`, place it at the position indicated by `k` and then increment `k`.
4. **Return the Length**: After the iteration, `k` will indicate the number of elements that are not equal to `val`.

# Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We start with `k` set to 0, indicating the start of the new array that we are forming in place.
- **Iteration and Placement**: As we iterate through `nums`, we check if the current element is not equal to `val`. If it isn't, we copy this element to the position `k` and increment `k`.
- **Result**: At the end of the loop, `k` will be the length of the array without `val`. The elements from index 0 to `k-1` in `nums` will be the elements that are not equal to `val`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We only traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are not using any extra space except for a few variables.

# Code
```typescript
function removeElement(nums: number[], val: number): number {
    let k = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== val) {
            nums[k] = nums[i];
            k++;
        }
    }
    
    return k;
};

```
