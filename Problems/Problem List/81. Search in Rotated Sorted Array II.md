[81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

# Intuition:
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Since the array is rotated, a normal binary search won't work directly. However, we can modify it to handle the rotation.
2. **Handling Rotations**:
   - In each step of the binary search, determine which part of the array (left or right) is properly sorted.
   - If the left part is sorted, check if the target lies within the range of the sorted left part.
   - If the right part is sorted, check if the target lies within the range of the sorted right part.
3. **Handling Duplicates**:
   - When duplicates are present, it can be challenging to decide which part of the array is sorted. In such cases, move the pointers inward to skip duplicates and proceed.

# Approach:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array respectively.
2. Perform binary search:
   - Calculate the mid-point.
   - Check if the middle element is the target. If so, return true.
   - Determine which part (left or right) is sorted by comparing elements.
   - Adjust pointers based on the sorted part and the target's value.
   - Handle duplicates by incrementing or decrementing the pointers when elements at `left`, `mid`, and `right` are equal.
3. If the loop exits without finding the target, return false.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)*** in the average case. However, in the worst case, due to duplicates, it can degrade to ***O(n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we are using constant extra space.

# Code:
```typescript
function search(nums: number[], target: number): boolean {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return true;
        }

        if (nums[left] === nums[mid] && nums[mid] === nums[right]) {
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        else if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        else {
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Calculate `mid`.
   - Check if `nums[mid]` is the target.
   - Handle the duplicates by incrementing `left` and decrementing `right` if they are equal to `nums[mid]`.
   - Determine if the left part is sorted and adjust `left` and `right` accordingly.
3. **Return**:
   - Return false if the target is not found.
