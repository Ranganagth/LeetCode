[43. Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

# Intuition
To multiply two large numbers represented as strings, we can simulate the process of manual multiplication that we typically do by hand. This involves multiplying each digit of the first number by each digit of the second number and keeping track of the carries.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Result Array**: Create an array to store the intermediate results of the multiplication. The maximum possible length of the result will be the sum of the lengths of the two input strings.
2. **Multiply Digits**: For each digit in `num1`, multiply it by each digit in `num2` and add the result to the corresponding position in the result array.
3. **Handle Carries**: After all multiplications, handle the carries in the result array.
4. **Convert to String**: Convert the result array to a string, removing any leading zeros.

# Explanation
1. **Result Array Initialization**: If `num1` has `m` digits and `num2` has `n` digits, the result of the multiplication can have at most `m + n` digits. Initialize an array of size `m + n` with zeros.
2. **Digit Multiplication**: Iterate through each digit of `num1` and `num2` from right to left. Multiply the current digits and add the product to the appropriate position in the result array.
3. **Carry Handling**: After populating the result array with the products, iterate through the array to handle any carries.
4. **String Conversion**: Convert the result array to a string, ensuring that any leading zeros are removed.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the length of `num1` and `n` is the length of `num2`. This is because each digit of `num1` is multiplied by each digit of `num2`.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(m + n)*** due to the result array that stores the intermediate results.

# Code
```typescript
function multiply(num1: string, num2: string): string {
    const m = num1.length, n = num2.length;
    const result = new Array(m + n).fill(0);

    for (let i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            const mul = (+num1[i]) * (+num2[j]);
            const sum = mul + result[i + j + 1];

            result[i + j + 1] = sum % 10;
            result[i + j] += Math.floor(sum / 10);
        }
    }

    while (result.length && result[0] === 0) {
        result.shift();
    }

    return result.length ? result.join('') : '0';
}

```
