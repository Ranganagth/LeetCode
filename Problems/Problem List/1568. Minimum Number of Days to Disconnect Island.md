[1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-disconnect-island/)

# Intuition

1. **Connected Components**: First, determine if the grid is already disconnected by checking the number of connected components (islands). If there is more than one island, the grid is already disconnected, and the answer is 0 days.
   
2. **Single Removal Check**: Try removing each land cell one by one and check if the grid becomes disconnected. If removing any single land cell leads to disconnection, the answer is 1 day.

3. **Double Removal Check**: If the grid is still connected after trying all single removals, it means we need to remove at least two cells to disconnect the grid. In this case, the answer is 2 days.

# Approach

1. **Count Islands**: Implement a function to count the number of islands in the grid using Depth First Search (DFS).

2. **Single Land Cell Removal**: For each land cell, temporarily remove it and check the number of islands.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: If the grid consists of only one cell and it is land, removing it would make the grid empty, resulting in 0 islands.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case time complexity involves checking all land cells and counting islands for each removal, which is ***O((m × n)²)***.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(m × n)*** due to the DFS stack.

# Code

```typescript
function minDaysToDisconnectGrid(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    function countIslands(grid: number[][]): number {
        const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
        let islandCount = 0;

        function dfs(x: number, y: number) {
            if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n || grid[x][y] === 0 || visited[x][y]) {
                return;
            }
            visited[x][y] = true;
            dfs(x + 1, y);
            dfs(x - 1, y);
            dfs(x, y + 1);
            dfs(x, y - 1);
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] === 1 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    islandCount++;
                    dfs(i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        return islandCount;
    }

    if (countIslands(grid) !== 1) return 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                grid[i][j] = 0;
                if (countIslands(grid) !== 1) return 1;
                grid[i][j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return 2;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Count Islands Function**: This function uses DFS to count the number of islands in the current grid configuration.
2. **Initial Check**: Check if the grid is already disconnected by counting the number of islands.
3. **Single Removal Check**: Iterate through each cell, remove the land cell, and check if the grid becomes disconnected.
4. **Return 2 Days**: If none of the single removals work, it requires at least 2 days to disconnect the grid.
