[516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/)

# Intuition

1. If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2` because the characters at both ends are the same and contribute to the palindrome.
2. If `s[i] != s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])` because the characters at both ends do not match, and we need to take the maximum length by either excluding the character at the start or the end.

# Approach

1. Initialize a 2D DP array of size `n x n` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Set all values to 0.
2. Set the diagonal values `dp[i][i] = 1` because a single character is always a palindrome of length 1.
3. Fill the DP table such that for each substring length from 2 to `n`, compute the values based on the conditions mentioned above.
4. The value `dp[0][n-1]` will contain the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the entire string `s`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** because we are filling an *n x n* DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** due to the space required to store the DP table.

# Code
```typescript
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s: string): number {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
    }

    for (let len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            const j = i + len - 1;
            if (s[i] === s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
};

```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: We start by initializing a 2D DP array with all values set to 0.
- **Base Case**: We set `dp[i][i] = 1` because any single character is a palindrome.
- **DP Table Filling**: We iteratively fill the DP table for substrings of length 2 to `n`. For each substring `s[i:j+1]`, we update `dp[i][j]` based on whether the characters at `i` and `j` are equal or not.
- **Result**: The value at `dp[0][n-1]` gives the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for the entire string `s`.
