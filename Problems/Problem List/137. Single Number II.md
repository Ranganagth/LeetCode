[137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

# Intuition

The core idea is to use bitwise operations to count the occurrences of each bit position across all numbers in the array. If a bit appears three times, it should cancel out to zero. The bit that appears only once will remain. By summing up the bits that do not cancel out, we can reconstruct the number that appears only once.

# Approach

1. **Bitwise Count**: Use a 32-bit integer representation to count the occurrences of each bit across all numbers.
2. **Three-state Bit Counters**: Instead of using an array to count each bit's occurrences, use two integers (`ones` and `twos`) to keep track of the bits that have appeared once and twice, respectively. This approach effectively manages the three states (appearing once, twice, and three times).
3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - For each number in the array, update `twos` first to include bits that are transitioning from once to twice.
   - Update `ones` next to include bits that are transitioning from zero to once.
   - Use `common_bit_mask` to clear out bits that have appeared three times.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of elements in the array, since we process each element once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function singleNumber(nums: number[]): number {
    let ones = 0, twos = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        twos |= ones & num;
        ones ^= num;
        const common_bit_mask = ~(ones & twos);
        ones &= common_bit_mask;
        twos &= common_bit_mask;
    }

    return ones;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: `ones` and `twos` are initialized to 0.
2. **For each number in the array**:
   - Update `twos` to include bits that are transitioning from once to twice by using the expression `twos |= ones & num`.
   - Update `ones` to include bits that are transitioning from zero to once or from twice to zero using `ones ^= num`.
   - The `common_bit_mask` is calculated to identify bits that have appeared three times and should be cleared out from both `ones` and `twos`.
   - Apply the mask to `ones` and `twos` to clear out bits that have appeared three times.
3. **Result**: After processing all numbers, `ones` contains the bits of the number that appears exactly once.
