[258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/)

# Intuition

You're asked to keep summing the digits of an integer `num` until it reduces to a **single digit**.

For example:
* `38 → 3+8 = 11 → 1+1 = 2`
* `0 → 0`

This is known as computing the **digital root** of a number.

There’s a well-known mathematical trick to do this in **O(1)** time using the **modulo 9** property.

# Approach (Using Digital Root)

**Digital root formula:**
For a non-zero number:

```
dr(num) = 1 + (num - 1) % 9
```

For `num == 0`, the result is `0`.

**Why it works:**
* Every number `num` is congruent to the sum of its digits modulo 9.
* This is due to the fact that 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, so powers of 10 don’t affect the mod 9 result.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(1)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

# Code

```typescript
function addDigits(num: number): number {
    if (num === 0) return 0;
    return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
}
```

### **Example Walkthroughs**

#### Example 1:

* Input: `38`

  * Step 1: 3 + 8 = 11
  * Step 2: 1 + 1 = 2
* Output: `2`

Using formula:
`1 + (38 - 1) % 9 = 1 + 37 % 9 = 1 + 1 = 2`

#### Example 2:

* Input: `0`
* Output: `0` (direct base case)

### **Summary**

This problem can be solved naively with loops or recursion, but using number theory (digital root concept), we achieve **constant-time** performance without iteration or recursion. This is a classic case of math optimizing computation.
