[436. Find Right Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-right-interval/)

# Intuition:
We need to find the "right interval" for each interval in the given list, which means identifying an interval that starts after or at the end of the current interval. To optimize the process of finding this right interval, we can leverage sorting and binary search techniques.

# Approach:
1. **Sorting the intervals**:
   - First, create a sorted list of intervals based on their start points while keeping track of their original indices.
   
2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each interval, perform a binary search on the sorted intervals to find the smallest starting point that is greater than or equal to the end of the current interval. This will give us the "right interval."
   
3. **Efficient Searching**:
   - Since binary search takes O(log n) time and we are doing it for each interval, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), which is much faster than checking each interval with every other interval in a brute force manner (which would be O(nÂ²)).

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting and binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the indices and results.

# Code:
```typescript
function findRightInterval(intervals: number[][]): number[] {
    const n = intervals.length;
    const result: number[] = new Array(n).fill(-1);

    const starts = intervals.map((interval, index) => [interval[0], index]);
    starts.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const binarySearch = (target: number): number => {
        let left = 0, right = n - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (starts[mid][0] >= target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const end = intervals[i][1];
        const idx = binarySearch(end);
        if (idx < n) {
            result[i] = starts[idx][1];
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - We first create a new array `starts` where each element is `[start, index]`, keeping track of the original indices of the intervals.
   - We sort this `starts` array based on the starting points.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each interval, we perform a binary search on the `starts` array to find the smallest interval that has a start point greater than or equal to the end of the current interval.
   - The binary search returns the index of this interval, and we update our result array with the corresponding original index. If no such interval exists, we leave the result as `-1`.

3. **Result**:
   - Finally, after checking all intervals, we return the result array containing the indices of the right intervals.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `intervals = [[1,2]]`

- Only one interval is present, so no right interval exists. Return `[-1]`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]`

- Sort the intervals by their start points: `[(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)]`.
  
  Now, perform binary search:
  - For interval `[3,4]`, no interval has a start >= 4. Hence, `result[0] = -1`.
  - For interval `[2,3]`, the smallest interval with start >= 3 is `[3,4]`. Hence, `result[1] = 0`.
  - For interval `[1,2]`, the smallest interval with start >= 2 is `[2,3]`. Hence, `result[2] = 1`.

Output: `[-1, 0, 1]`

#### Example 3:
Input: `intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]`

- Sort the intervals by their start points: `[(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)]`.

  Now, perform binary search:
  - For interval `[1,4]`, no interval has a start >= 4. Hence, `result[0] = -1`.
  - For interval `[2,3]`, the smallest interval with start >= 3 is `[3,4]`. Hence, `result[1] = 2`.
  - For interval `[3,4]`, no interval has a start >= 4. Hence, `result[2] = -1`.

Output: `[-1, 2, -1]`

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently finds the right intervals using sorting and binary search, resulting in optimal performance for large inputs (up to 20,000 intervals).
