[518. Coin Change II](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/)

# Intuition

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make the amount `i` using the given coins.
2. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0]` to 1 because there is exactly one way to make the amount 0, which is to use no coins at all.
3. **Update the DP Array**: For each coin, update the `dp` array from the coin's value up to the given amount. This ensures that we consider each coin for all possible amounts.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: Initialize the `dp` array with zeros and set `dp[0]` to 1.
2. **Fill the DP Array**: For each coin, iterate through all amounts from the coin's value to the target amount. Update the number of ways to make each amount by adding the number of ways to make the current amount minus the coin's value.
3. **Result**: The value `dp[amount]` will give the number of combinations to make up the given amount.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n Ã— m)***, where *n* is the amount and *m* is the number of coins. This is because for each coin, we iterate through all possible amounts.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array storing results up to the given amount.

# Code
```typescript
function change(amount: number, coins: number[]): number {
    const dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (const coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
        }
    }

    return dp[amount];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with zeros, and `dp[0]` is set to 1 since there is one way to make the amount 0 (using no coins).
2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each coin in the coins array, iterate through amounts from the coin's value up to the target amount.
   - Update `dp[i]` by adding `dp[i - coin]` to it, which represents the number of ways to make the amount `i` by including the current coin.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return `dp[amount]`, which contains the number of ways to make the given amount using the provided coins.
