[983. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/)

# Intuition

For each day that we need to travel, we can decide whether to buy a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass. We can then use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost up to each day.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to cover travel days up to day `i`.
   - Set the size of `dp` to be 366 (for days 0 to 365).

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each travel day, compute the minimum cost by considering three scenarios:
     1. Buy a 1-day pass.
     2. Buy a 7-day pass.
     3. Buy a 30-day pass.
   - Update the `dp` array based on these scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If a particular day is not a travel day, the cost remains the same as the previous day.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + D)*** where `n` is the number of travel days and `D` is the maximum day (365). This is efficient because we only loop through each day of the year once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(D)*** for the `dp` array which is fixed at 366 elements.

### Code
```typescript
function mincostTickets(days: number[], costs: number[]): number {
    const maxDay = 365;
    const travelDays = new Set(days);
    const dp = new Array(maxDay + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let day = 1; day <= maxDay; day++) {
        if (!travelDays.has(day)) {
            dp[day] = dp[day - 1];
        } else {
            const cost1Day = dp[day - 1] + costs[0];
            const cost7Days = dp[Math.max(0, day - 7)] + costs[1];
            const cost30Days = dp[Math.max(0, day - 30)] + costs[2];
            dp[day] = Math.min(cost1Day, cost7Days, cost30Days);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maxDay];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `maxDay` is set to 365.
   - `travelDays` is a set of the given travel days for quick lookup.
   - `dp` is an array initialized to zero with size 366.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - Iterate over each day from 1 to 365.
   - If the day is not a travel day, inherit the cost from the previous day.
   - If the day is a travel day, calculate the cost of using a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day pass and update `dp[day]` with the minimum of these costs.
