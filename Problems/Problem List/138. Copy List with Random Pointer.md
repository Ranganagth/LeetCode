[138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

# Intuition
The problem involves creating a deep copy of a linked list where each node also has a `random` pointer that can point to any node in the list (including `null`). The challenge is to perform this in linear time complexity O(n) using constant extra space.

# Approach

1. **Iterative Deep Copy with Hash Map**:
   - We will use a hash map (`originalToCopy`) to create a mapping between original nodes and their corresponding new nodes.
   - We'll iterate through the original linked list:
     - For each node, create a new node in the copied list.
     - Maintain a mapping from each original node to its copy in the hash map.
     - Set the `next` pointer of each new node to point to its corresponding next node.
   - After creating the `next` pointers, iterate again to set the `random` pointers:
     - For each node, set its `random` pointer in the copied list using the mapping from the hash map.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create a hash map `originalToCopy` to store mappings from original nodes to their copies.
   - Iterate through the original list to create copies and populate the `originalToCopy` map.
   - Iterate again to set `random` pointers using the `originalToCopy` map.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where the original list is empty.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We make two passes through the list, each pass being ***O(n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** due to the hash map used to store mappings from original nodes to their copies. If we don't consider the space used for output, the space complexity is ***O(1)***.

# Code
```typescript
class Node {
    val: number;
    next: Node | null;
    random: Node | null;
    
    constructor(val?: number, next?: Node, random?: Node) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
        this.random = (random === undefined ? null : random);
    }
}

function copyRandomList(head: Node | null): Node | null {
    if (!head) return null;
    
    let current: Node | null = head;
    const originalToCopy = new Map<Node, Node>();
    
    while (current) {
        const copy = new Node(current.val);
        originalToCopy.set(current, copy);
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    current = head;
    while (current) {
        const copy = originalToCopy.get(current)!;
        copy.next = originalToCopy.get(current.next) || null;
        copy.random = originalToCopy.get(current.random) || null;
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    return originalToCopy.get(head)!;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Class Node**:
   - Defines the structure of a node with `val`, `next`, and `random` pointers.

2. **copyRandomList Function**:
   - Checks if the input `head` is null and returns null if so.
   - Creates a map `originalToCopy` to store mappings between original nodes and their copies.
   - **First Pass**: Iterates through the original list to create copies of each node and populate the `originalToCopy` map.
   - **Second Pass**: Iterates through the original list again to set the `next` and `random` pointers for each node in the copied list using the mappings from `originalToCopy`.
   - Returns the head of the copied list.
