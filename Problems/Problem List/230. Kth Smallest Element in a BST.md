[230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

# Intuition

In a Binary Search Tree, the **in-order traversal** (left → root → right) visits nodes in **ascending order**. So, if we perform an in-order traversal and count nodes as we visit them, the `k`-th node visited is the `k`-th smallest.

# Approach

1. Use an in-order traversal (recursive or iterative).
2. Keep a counter to track the number of visited nodes.
3. When the counter reaches `k`, return that node's value.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(H + k)` where `H` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, `O(n)`.

* **Space Complexity**:
  * Recursive: `O(H)` due to call stack.
  * Iterative: `O(H)` for the explicit stack used.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.left = left ?? null;
        this.right = right ?? null;
    }
}

function kthSmallest(root: TreeNode | null, k: number): number {
    const stack: TreeNode[] = [];
    let current = root;

    while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }

        current = stack.pop()!;
        k--;
        if (k === 0) return current.val;
        current = current.right;
    }

    return -1; // This line is unreachable if k is valid
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### Example 1:

* **Input**: root = \[3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
* In-order traversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
* Output: `1` (1st smallest)

#### Example 2:

* **Input**: root = \[5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
* In-order traversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
* Output: `3` (3rd smallest)

### **Follow-up Optimization (for frequent modifications):**

To support frequent insert/delete and fast kth smallest:
1. **Augment the BST nodes** with an additional field: `leftSubtreeSize` — the count of nodes in the left subtree.
2. During insertions and deletions, update this count.
3. Use this count to find the k-th smallest in `O(H)` time without a full traversal.

This converts the BST into an **Order Statistic Tree**, which supports:
* Insert/Delete: `O(H)`
* kth smallest: `O(H)`
