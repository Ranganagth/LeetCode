[1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/)

# Intuition:

1. **Track Moves**:
   - Since it's a 3x3 grid, we can track the rows, columns, and diagonals for each player to check if they have filled any line.

2. **Check for Win Conditions**:
   - A player wins if they have completely filled any row, column, or diagonal with their mark (`X` for player A and `O` for player B).

3. **Determine the Game State**:
   - After processing all moves:
     - If a player has a winning line, return the corresponding player (`A` or `B`).
     - If all squares are filled and no one has won, return `"Draw"`.
     - If the grid is not full and there's no winner, return `"Pending"`.

# Approach:

1. **Initialize Tracking Arrays**:
   - Use arrays to keep track of the count of marks for each row, column, and diagonals for both players.

2. **Process Each Move**:
   - For each move, update the appropriate row, column, and diagonal counters for the current player.
   - Check if any of these counters reach 3, indicating a win.

3. **Determine the Final Outcome**:
   - If no player wins and all moves have been made, it's a draw.
   - If there are moves left after processing all moves, the game is pending.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of moves (at most 9).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we're only using fixed-size arrays to track the state of the game.

# Code:

```typescript
function tictactoe(moves: number[][]): string {
    const n = 3;
    const rowsA = Array(n).fill(0);
    const colsA = Array(n).fill(0);
    const diagA = [0, 0];
    
    const rowsB = Array(n).fill(0);
    const colsB = Array(n).fill(0);
    const diagB = [0, 0];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < moves.length; i++) {
        const r = moves[i][0];
        const c = moves[i][1];
        
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            rowsA[r]++;
            colsA[c]++;
            if (r === c) diagA[0]++;
            if (r + c === n - 1) diagA[1]++;
            
            if (rowsA[r] === n || colsA[c] === n || diagA[0] === n || diagA[1] === n) {
                return "A";
            }
        } else {
            rowsB[r]++;
            colsB[c]++;
            if (r === c) diagB[0]++;
            if (r + c === n - 1) diagB[1]++;
            
            if (rowsB[r] === n || colsB[c] === n || diagB[0] === n || diagB[1] === n) {
                return "B";
            }
        }
    }
    
    return moves.length === n * n ? "Draw" : "Pending";
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]])); // Output: "A"
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]])); // Output: "B"
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]])); // Output: "Draw"
```

### Explanation:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Moves: `[[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]`
   - Player A wins with a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right: `[[0,0],[1,1],[2,2]]`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Moves: `[[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]`
   - Player B wins with a vertical line in the first column: `[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Moves: `[[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]`
   - All cells are filled, and no player has won, so the game ends in a `"Draw"`.
