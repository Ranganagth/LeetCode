[1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/)

# Intuition

To find the count of odd numbers between two given integers, `low` and `high`, we can make use of the properties of arithmetic sequences. Specifically, we can calculate the number of odd numbers between `low` and `high` directly, without needing to iterate through all numbers in that range.

# Approach

1. **Counting Odd Numbers**: 
   - If `low` is odd, include it; if `high` is odd, include it. 
   - If both are even, the number of odd numbers between `low` and `high` is straightforward. Otherwise, it depends on whether either `low` or `high` is odd.

2. **Formula**:
   - For any `low` and `high`, the number of odd integers in the range `[low, high]` can be calculated as:
     count = ((high - low)/2) + 1 if low or high is odd. Otherwise: (high - low)/2
   - Simplifying this to a formula that works in all cases:
     count = (high + 1)/2 - (low/2)
   - This formula calculates the difference between the count of odd numbers up to `high` and up to `low - 1`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)*** - The computation is done in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** - No additional space is used.

# Code

```typescript
function countOdds(low: number, high: number): number {
    return Math.floor((high + 1) / 2) - Math.floor(low / 2);
}
```

### Explanation
- **Math.floor((high + 1) / 2)**: This gives the count of odd numbers from `0` to `high`.
- **Math.floor(low / 2)**: This gives the count of odd numbers from `0` to `low - 1`.
- Subtracting these gives the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).
