[310. Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

### Problem Summary

You're given a **tree** with `n` nodes (0 to n-1) and a list of `n - 1` **undirected edges**. A tree rooted at node `x` has **height h**, defined as the longest path from `x` to a leaf. Among all rooted trees, those with the **minimum possible height** are **Minimum Height Trees (MHTs)**. You must **return the root labels** of all MHTs.

---

# Intuition

To minimize the tree's height, we should choose the **center(s)** of the tree as root(s).
* A tree can have **1 or 2 centers** depending on its shape.
* The process to find centers is **similar to a topological sort**:
  * **Remove all leaf nodes** layer by layer (BFS from leaves).
  * The last 1 or 2 nodes remaining are the **centroids** of the tree — the root(s) of MHTs.

This process mimics **peeling the tree from outside to inside** until we hit the core.

---

# Approach

1. **Build the graph** using an adjacency list.
2. **Track the degree** (number of connections) of each node.
3. **Identify all leaves** (nodes with degree 1).
4. Perform **BFS**, removing leaves layer by layer.
5. When only 1 or 2 nodes remain, they are the **centers** — return them.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(n)`
  Every edge and node is visited once.
* **Space**: `O(n)`
  For graph, degrees, and queue.

# Code

```ts
function findMinHeightTrees(n: number, edges: number[][]): number[] {
    if (n === 1) return [0];

    // Step 1: Build the graph and degree map
    const graph: Map<number, Set<number>> = new Map();
    const degree: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, new Set());
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, new Set());
        graph.get(u)!.add(v);
        graph.get(v)!.add(u);
        degree[u]++;
        degree[v]++;
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize leaves (nodes with degree 1)
    let leaves: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (degree[i] === 1) leaves.push(i);
    }

    // Step 3: Trim leaves layer by layer
    let remainingNodes = n;
    while (remainingNodes > 2) {
        const newLeaves: number[] = [];
        remainingNodes -= leaves.length;

        for (const leaf of leaves) {
            for (const neighbor of graph.get(leaf)!) {
                graph.get(neighbor)!.delete(leaf);
                degree[neighbor]--;
                if (degree[neighbor] === 1) {
                    newLeaves.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        leaves = newLeaves;
    }

    return leaves;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:

```ts
n = 6
edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
```

#### Process:

* Initial leaf nodes: `[0, 1, 2, 5]`
* Remove these → update neighbors → new leaves: `[3, 4]`
* Remove these → only 2 nodes remain → return `[3, 4]`

#### Output:

```ts
[3, 4]
```

---

### **Summary**

* MHT roots are the **centers** of the tree.
* We simulate peeling the tree from the leaves inward using BFS.
* The last 1 or 2 nodes are the optimal roots.

This is a classic and optimal `O(n)` solution using **graph + BFS** techniques for tree center detection.
