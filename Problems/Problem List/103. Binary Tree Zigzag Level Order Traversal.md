[103. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)

# Intuition
To perform a zigzag level order traversal of a binary tree, we can utilize a queue for level-order traversal and an alternating direction indicator to determine whether to append node values from left to right or right to left.

# Approach
1. Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree.
2. Use a boolean flag to indicate the direction of traversal (left to right or right to left).
3. For each level:
   - Calculate the size of the current level (number of nodes in the queue).
   - Initialize a temporary array to store node values at the current level.
   - Dequeue all nodes of the current level and add their values to the temporary array.
   - Depending on the direction flag, either append the temporary array to the result array or reverse it and then append it to the result array.
   - Toggle the direction flag after processing each level.
4. Continue this process until all levels have been processed.
5. Return the result array containing the zigzag level order traversal.

# Explanation
1. Start with the root node and enqueue it into the queue.
2. Initialize an empty array to store the result.
3. Initialize a boolean flag `leftToRight` to true, indicating the initial direction of traversal.
4. Begin a loop to process each level of the tree:
   - Calculate the size of the current level.
   - Initialize an empty temporary array to store the values of nodes at the current level.
   - Dequeue all nodes of the current level, add their values to the temporary array, and enqueue their children.
   - Depending on the `leftToRight` flag, either push the temporary array as-is or reverse it before pushing it to the result array.
   - Toggle the `leftToRight` flag to switch the direction of traversal for the next level.
5. Continue this process until the queue is empty.
6. Return the result array containing the zigzag level order traversal.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The algorithm visits each node once and performs a constant amount of work for each visit. Therefore, the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
  
- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(m)***, where m is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree. This is because the queue can hold at most all nodes at the maximum level. In the worst case, m can be up to n/2 + 1 in a complete binary tree, where n is the total number of nodes.

# Code
```TypeScript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function zigzagLevelOrder(root: TreeNode | null): number[][] {
    if (!root) return [];
    
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const queue: TreeNode[] = [];
    let leftToRight = true;
    queue.push(root);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        const currentLevel: number[] = [];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            currentLevel.push(node.val);
            
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
        
        if (!leftToRight) {
            currentLevel.reverse();
        }
        
        result.push(currentLevel);
        leftToRight = !leftToRight;
    }
    
    return result;
};
