[115. Distinct Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/)

# Intuition

The problem requires counting the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that equal `t`. This can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) because it involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form the substring `t[0..j-1]` using the substring `s[0..i-1]`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `t` is an empty string (i.e., `j = 0`), there is exactly one way to match it with any prefix of `s` (by deleting all characters in `s`).
     - `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i`.
   - If `s` is an empty string (i.e., `i = 0` and `j > 0`), it cannot form any non-empty `t`.
     - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0`.

3. **DP Transition**:
   - For each character in `s` and `t`, there are two main cases:
     - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`: We can either use this character in `s` to match `t[j-1]` or skip it.
       - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`
     - If `s[i-1] != t[j-1]`: We cannot use this character, so we skip it.
       - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, for the DP table.

# Code
```typescript
function numDistinct(s: string, t: string): number {
    const m = s.length;
    const n = t.length;
    
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (s[i - 1] === t[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `dp` table is initialized with `0`s.
   - We set `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `i` because there's one way to match an empty `t`.

2. **DP Table Filling**:
   - We iterate through each character of `s` (outer loop) and each character of `t` (inner loop).
   - Depending on whether the characters match or not, we update the `dp` table based on the transition rules.

3. **Result**:
   - The value in `dp[m][n]` gives us the number of distinct subsequences of `s` that match `t`.
