[319. Bulb Switcher](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/)

# Intuition

The problem requires determining how many bulbs are on after performing a series of toggles based on certain rules. The key observation here is that a bulb ends up being toggled a number of times equal to the number of its divisors. A bulb will be on if and only if it is toggled an odd number of times, which happens if and only if it has an odd number of divisors.

A number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it is a perfect square. For example:
- 1 has 1 divisor: [1]
- 4 has 3 divisors: [1, 2, 4]
- 9 has 3 divisors: [1, 3, 9]

This means the problem boils down to counting the perfect squares less than or equal to `n`.

# Approach

To solve this problem, you need to count the perfect squares up to `n`. The number of perfect squares less than or equal to `n` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. Mathematically, this is represented as `floor(sqrt(n))`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)***, because calculating the square root and flooring it is done in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since no additional space is required.

# Code
```typescript
function bulbSwitch(n: number): number {
    return Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `bulbSwitch` takes an integer `n`.

2. **Calculate the Result**:
   - The function returns `Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n))`, which gives the count of perfect squares less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Examples**:
   - For `n = 3`, the perfect squares are `[1]`. Thus, the output is `1`.
   - For `n = 0`, there are no bulbs, so the output is `0`.
   - For `n = 1`, the perfect squares are `[1]`. Thus, the output is `1`.
