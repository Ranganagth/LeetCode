[508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/)

# Intuition:

The problem asks for the most frequent subtree sum in a binary tree. A **subtree sum** is defined as the sum of all nodes' values in a subtree rooted at a particular node, including that node itself. To solve this problem:

1. We need to calculate the subtree sum for each node.
2. Track how frequently each subtree sum occurs.
3. Return the subtree sum(s) that appear the most frequently.

# Approach:

1. **Recursive Post-order Traversal**:
   - We perform a post-order traversal (left, right, root) because, for each node, we first need the sums of its left and right subtrees before calculating the sum for the node itself.
   - The subtree sum for any node is `node.val + left_subtree_sum + right_subtree_sum`.
   
2. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each subtree sum.
   
3. **Result**:
   - After calculating all subtree sums, find the maximum frequency and collect all subtree sums that appear that many times.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Define a helper function that recursively computes the subtree sum for each node.
2. For each node, calculate the sum of its subtree, and update the frequency map.
3. After traversing the entire tree, determine the maximum frequency and collect all subtree sums with that frequency.
4. Return the result as a list.

# Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the post-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, because we need space for the recursive stack and for storing the frequency of each unique subtree sum.

# Code:

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function findFrequentTreeSum(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    if (!root) return [];
    
    const sumFrequency = new Map<number, number>();
    let maxFrequency = 0;
    
    function calculateSubtreeSum(node: TreeNode | null): number {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        const leftSum = calculateSubtreeSum(node.left);
        const rightSum = calculateSubtreeSum(node.right);
        const subtreeSum = node.val + leftSum + rightSum;
        
        sumFrequency.set(subtreeSum, (sumFrequency.get(subtreeSum) || 0) + 1);
        
        maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, sumFrequency.get(subtreeSum)!);
        
        return subtreeSum;
    }
    
    calculateSubtreeSum(root);
    
    const result: number[] = [];
    for (const [sum, frequency] of sumFrequency) {
        if (frequency === maxFrequency) {
            result.push(sum);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **TreeNode class**: Represents each node in the binary tree. Each node has a value `val`, a left child `left`, and a right child `right`.
   
2. **findFrequentTreeSum function**:
   - First, we handle the base case where the root is `null` by returning an empty array.
   - We use a `Map` called `sumFrequency` to store the frequency of each subtree sum and a variable `maxFrequency` to keep track of the highest frequency.
   
3. **calculateSubtreeSum helper**:
   - This recursive function computes the sum of the subtree rooted at the given node. It does so by first calculating the sums of the left and right subtrees.
   - For each node, it calculates the total subtree sum and updates its frequency in the `sumFrequency` map.
   - We update `maxFrequency` whenever a new maximum frequency is found.
   
4. **Result collection**:
   - After the traversal, we go through the `sumFrequency` map and collect all sums that have the maximum frequency.
   
5. **Return**: The final result is an array of the most frequent subtree sums.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `root = [5, 2, -3]`

- **Step 1**: Traverse the tree in post-order:
  - Subtree rooted at `2`: `sum = 2`
  - Subtree rooted at `-3`: `sum = -3`
  - Subtree rooted at `5`: `sum = 5 + 2 + (-3) = 4`

- **Step 2**: Frequency map after traversal:
  - `{2: 1, -3: 1, 4: 1}`

- **Step 3**: The maximum frequency is 1. Hence, the result is `[2, -3, 4]`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `root = [5, 2, -5]`

- **Step 1**: Traverse the tree in post-order:
  - Subtree rooted at `2`: `sum = 2`
  - Subtree rooted at `-5`: `sum = -5`
  - Subtree rooted at `5`: `sum = 5 + 2 + (-5) = 2`

- **Step 2**: Frequency map after traversal:
  - `{2: 2, -5: 1}`

- **Step 3**: The maximum frequency is 2. Hence, the result is `[2]`.
