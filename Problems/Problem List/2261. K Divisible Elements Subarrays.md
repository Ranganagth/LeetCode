[2261. K Divisible Elements Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-divisible-elements-subarrays/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct subarrays in `nums` that contain at most `k` elements divisible by `p`. A brute force approach would involve checking all possible subarrays and counting the elements divisible by `p` in each one, which would be inefficient.

A more efficient approach leverages the sliding window technique combined with a set to track distinct subarrays. By moving through the array and dynamically adjusting the window, we can efficiently count the number of elements divisible by `p` and store distinct subarrays.

# Approach

1. **Sliding Window with Set for Distinct Subarrays**:
   - Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window.
   - Use a counter to keep track of the number of elements divisible by `p` in the current window.
   - Use a set to store distinct subarrays.
   - For each position of `end`, expand the window by moving `end` and update the counter if `nums[end]` is divisible by `p`.
   - If the counter exceeds `k`, move the `start` pointer to the right until the counter is less than or equal to `k`.
   - Add the subarray defined by the current window to the set of distinct subarrays.

2. **Counting Distinct Subarrays**:
   - Convert each subarray to a string or tuple before adding to the set to ensure each subarray is distinct.

# Complexity:
   - **Time Complexity:** ***O(n²)***, where *n* is the length of `nums`. This is because, in the worst case, we are examining every subarray.
   - **Space Complexity:** ***O(n²)*** for storing all possible subarrays in the set.

# Code
```typescript
function countDistinctSubarrays(nums: number[], k: number, p: number): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    const seen = new Set<string>();
    
    for (let start = 0; start < n; start++) {
        let countDivisibleByP = 0;
        let subarray = [];
        
        for (let end = start; end < n; end++) {
            subarray.push(nums[end]);
            if (nums[end] % p === 0) {
                countDivisibleByP++;
            }
            
            if (countDivisibleByP > k) {
                break;
            }
            
            seen.add(subarray.toString());
        }
    }
    
    return seen.size;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `seen` is a set to keep track of distinct subarrays.
   - We iterate over each possible starting point `start` of the subarray.

2. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each `start`, we initialize `countDivisibleByP` to count elements divisible by `p` and `subarray` to collect the current subarray elements.
   - For each possible end point `end`, we update the subarray and the count of elements divisible by `p`.
   - If `countDivisibleByP` exceeds `k`, we break out of the inner loop as further subarrays starting from `start` will not be valid.
   - Convert the current subarray to a string and add it to the `seen` set to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Result**:
   - The size of the `seen` set is the number of distinct subarrays meeting the criteria.
