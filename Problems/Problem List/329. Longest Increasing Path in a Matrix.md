[329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

# Intuition
To find the longest increasing path in a matrix, we can leverage Depth-First Search (DFS) along with memoization. The idea is to explore all possible paths starting from each cell, keeping track of the longest path found so far. By using memoization, we can store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

# Approach
1. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - We define a helper function `dfs(i, j)` that returns the length of the longest increasing path starting from cell `(i, j)`.
   - Use a 2D array `memo` where `memo[i][j]` stores the length of the longest increasing path starting from `(i, j)`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, if `memo[i][j]` is already computed, we return its value.
   - Otherwise, we explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right) and recursively compute the longest path for cells that have a greater value than the current cell.
   - The result for each cell is the maximum length found plus one (for the current cell itself).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the memoization table with zeros.
   - Iterate over all cells in the matrix, invoking the `dfs` function for each cell to ensure we explore all possible starting points.

3. **Result**:
   - The result is the maximum value found in the memoization table.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** since each cell is processed once, and the result is memoized.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** for the memoization table.

# Code
```typescript
function longestIncreasingPath(matrix: number[][]): number {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    const memo: number[][] = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];

    const dfs = (i: number, j: number): number => {
        if (memo[i][j] !== 0) return memo[i][j];
        
        let maxLength = 1;
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const x = i + dx;
            const y = j + dy;
            
            if (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols && matrix[x][y] > matrix[i][j]) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 1 + dfs(x, y));
            }
        }
        
        memo[i][j] = maxLength;
        return maxLength;
    };

    let result = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dfs(i, j));
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - The memoization table is initialized to store results of subproblems.
   - The `directions` array is used to simplify movement in four possible directions.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - Checks if the result is already computed (`memo[i][j]`).
   - Explores all valid neighboring cells and recursively calculates the longest path.
   - Updates the memoization table with the maximum length found.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterates over each cell in the matrix and invokes the `dfs` function to ensure all paths are considered.
   - Tracks the maximum path length found.
