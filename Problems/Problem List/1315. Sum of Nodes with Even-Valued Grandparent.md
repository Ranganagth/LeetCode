[1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/)

# Intuition

We are given a binary tree, and the task is to find the sum of values of nodes whose grandparents have even values. To solve this, we need to traverse the tree and keep track of each node's grandparent and parent values. If the grandparent's value is even, we include the node's value in the sum.

# Approach

1. **Tree Traversal**: We can solve this problem using a DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search). During the traversal, we pass the current node along with its parent and grandparent values down the tree.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each node, check if its grandparent exists and whether its value is even.
   - If the grandparent's value is even, add the node's value to the sum.

3. **Recursive DFS**:
   - We can recursively traverse the tree, starting from the root.
   - At each step, the current node will be passed along with its parent and grandparent to the child nodes.
   - If the grandparent is even, the node's value is added to the cumulative sum.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(h)***, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is the space needed for the recursive call stack.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function sumEvenGrandparent(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    return dfs(root, null, null);
}

function dfs(current: TreeNode | null, parent: TreeNode | null, grandparent: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (current === null) return 0;

    let sum = 0;

    if (grandparent !== null && grandparent.val % 2 === 0) {
        sum += current.val;
    }

    sum += dfs(current.left, current, parent);
    sum += dfs(current.right, current, parent);

    return sum;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Defines the structure of a node in the binary tree.

2. **sumEvenGrandparent Function**:
   - This is the main function that initializes the recursive DFS traversal from the root.

3. **dfs Function**:
   - This function performs the DFS traversal, keeping track of the current node, its parent, and its grandparent.
   - If the grandparent is even, the current node's value is added to the sum.
   - The function recursively calls itself for the left and right child nodes.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

Input: `root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]`

- The nodes with even-valued grandparents are 9, 1, and 5.
- The sum of these nodes is \( 9 + 1 + 5 = 18 \).

#### Example 2:

Input: `root = [1]`

- There are no nodes with even-valued grandparents.
- The output is \( 0 \).

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10,000.
- Node values are between 1 and 100.
