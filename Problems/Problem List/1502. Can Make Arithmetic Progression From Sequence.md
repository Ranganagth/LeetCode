[1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-make-arithmetic-progression-from-sequence/)

# Intuition:
An arithmetic progression (AP) is a sequence where the difference between any two consecutive elements is constant. To determine if an array can be rearranged to form an AP:
1. Sort the array.
2. After sorting, the difference between consecutive elements should be the same for the entire array. If it is, then the array forms an AP.

# Approach:
1. Sort the array.
2. Compute the difference between the first two elements (this is the expected common difference).
3. Iterate through the sorted array and check if the difference between each consecutive pair of elements matches the expected difference.
4. If all consecutive differences match, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** if we disregard the space used by the sorting algorithm.

# Code

```typescript
function canMakeArithmeticProgression(arr: number[]): boolean {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const diff = arr[1] - arr[0];

    for (let i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] !== diff) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
};

```

### Examples:

1. **Input**: `arr = [3, 5, 1]`
   - **Output**: `true`
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 3, 5]`. The difference between consecutive elements is `2`, which is consistent.

2. **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 4]`
   - **Output**: `false`
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 4]`. The difference between consecutive elements is not consistent (`1` and `2`).
