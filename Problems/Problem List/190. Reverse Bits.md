[190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

# Intuition

Reversing the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer involves reading the bits from right to left and writing them from left to right in the result. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that the reversed bits are correctly positioned and that the final result is treated as an unsigned integer.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `result` initialized to 0. This variable will hold the reversed bits as we process the input.
   
2. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - Loop through all 32 bits of the input integer `n`.
   - In each iteration, do the following:
     - Left shift `result` by 1 to make room for the next bit.
     - Use bitwise AND (`&`) with 1 to extract the least significant bit of `n`.
     - Use bitwise OR (`|`) to set the corresponding bit in `result`.
     - Right shift `n` by 1 to process the next bit in the next iteration.

3. **Final Step**:
   - Since JavaScript does not have a native unsigned integer type, the result must be coerced into an unsigned 32-bit integer using `>>> 0` to ensure the correct interpretation of the binary result.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)***. The algorithm always processes 32 bits regardless of the input.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. We use a constant amount of space.

# Code
```typescript
function reverseBits(n: number): number {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        result <<= 1;
        result |= n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return result >>> 0;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result` is initialized to 0.
   
2. **Loop Through 32 Bits**:
   - For each of the 32 bits, shift `result` to the left by 1 bit.
   - Extract the least significant bit of `n` using `n & 1` and add it to `result` using `result |= n & 1`.
   - Shift `n` to the right by 1 bit using `n >>>= 1` to prepare for the next iteration.
   
3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Use `result >>> 0` to ensure the number is treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer before returning it.
