[326. Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

### Problem:

Check if a given integer `n` is a **power of 3**, i.e., can we find an integer `x` such that `n === 3^x`.

---

# Intuition:

A number is a power of 3 if:
* It's positive.
* It can be obtained by repeatedly dividing by 3 (i.e., no remainder) until we reach 1.

There are two main approaches:
1. **Loop-based approach:** Keep dividing `n` by 3 and check if it eventually becomes 1.
2. **Mathematical approach without loop/recursion (follow-up):** Use the maximum power of 3 that fits in a 32-bit integer.

---

# Approach 1: Using Loop

```ts
function isPowerOfThree(n: number): boolean {
    if (n <= 0) return false;
    while (n % 3 === 0) {
        n = n / 3;
    }
    return n === 1;
};

```

# Complexity Analysis:

* **Time:** O(log₃n)
* **Space:** O(1)

---

# Approach 2: No Loop / No Recursion (Follow-up)

We use the **largest power of 3** that fits in a 32-bit signed integer:

* $3¹⁹ = 1162261467$ (because $3²⁰ = 3486784401 > 2³¹ - 1$)

If `n` is a power of 3, it must divide `1162261467` evenly.

```ts
function isPowerOfThree(n: number): boolean {
    const maxPowerOfThree = 1162261467; // 3^19
    return n > 0 && (maxPowerOfThree % n === 0);
};

```

#### Why this works:

* Since 3 is a **prime number**, all its powers are divisible **only by smaller powers of 3**.
* So if `n` is a power of 3, it must divide $3^19$ without a remainder.

# Complexity Analysis:

* **Time:** O(1)
* **Space:** O(1)

### **Examples:**

#### Example 1:

Input: `n = 27`
* $3^3 = 27$ → return `true`

#### Example 2:

Input: `n = 0`
* 0 is not a power of 3 → return `false`

#### Example 3:

Input: `n = -1`
* Negative numbers can’t be powers of positive base → return `false`

---

### **Summary:**

* For general use, loop-based is easy and reliable.
* For optimized cases (e.g., no loop), precomputing the max power of 3 and checking divisibility is a clever constant-time trick.
