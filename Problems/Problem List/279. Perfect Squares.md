[279. Perfect Squares](https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/)

# Intuition

1. **Perfect Squares**: Identify that the problem involves finding the least number of terms from the sequence of perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, ...) that sum up to *n*.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of perfect squares that sum to *i*.
3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each number *i* from 1 to *n*, try to subtract each perfect square *j²* (where *j² ≤ i*) and use the result to update the `dp` array.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: Set `dp[0]` to 0 since zero perfect squares are needed to sum up to zero.
2. **Fill the DP Array**: For each number from 1 to *n*, iterate through all perfect squares less than or equal to the current number and update the `dp` array accordingly.
3. **Result**: The value `dp[n]` will be the answer.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n √n)***, where for each number *i* up to *n*, we iterate over all possible perfect squares up to *i*.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array storing results up to *n*.

# Code
```typescript
function numSquares(n: number): number {
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1);
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with `Infinity` values, and `dp[0]` is set to 0 since no perfect squares are needed to make 0.
2. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, iterate through all perfect squares *j²* such that *j² ≤ i*.
   - Update `dp[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - j^2] + 1`.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, return `dp[n]`, which contains the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to *n*.
