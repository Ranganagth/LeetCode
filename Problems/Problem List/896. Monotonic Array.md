[896. Monotonic Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/monotonic-array/)

# Intuition:
To determine if an array is monotonic, we need to check whether it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking the relationship between consecutive elements.

# Approach:
1. **Monotone Increasing Check**: Check if each element is less than or equal to the next one.
2. **Monotone Decreasing Check**: Check if each element is greater than or equal to the next one.
3. If the array satisfies either condition, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. We only need to make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of space.

# Code:

```typescript
function isMonotonic(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let increasing = true;
    let decreasing = true;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            decreasing = false;
        }
        if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            increasing = false;
        }
    }

    return increasing || decreasing;
}
```

### Examples:

1. **Input**: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3]`
   - **Output**: `true`
   - **Explanation**: The array is monotone increasing.

2. **Input**: `nums = [6, 5, 4, 4]`
   - **Output**: `true`
   - **Explanation**: The array is monotone decreasing.

3. **Input**: `nums = [1, 3, 2]`
   - **Output**: `false`
   - **Explanation**: The array is neither monotone increasing nor decreasing.
