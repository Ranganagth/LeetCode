[502. IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of selecting up to `k` projects to maximize the final capital, we need to prioritize projects based on their profitability while ensuring that the projects we select are affordable given the current capital. The main challenge is to efficiently determine the most profitable project that can be started with the available capital at any given time.

# Approach

1. **Sort Projects by Capital Requirement:** First, sort the projects by their capital requirement. This helps us quickly identify which projects are affordable with the current capital.

2. **Use a Max-Heap for Profits:** Maintain a max-heap to keep track of the profits of projects that can be afforded. The max-heap allows us to efficiently extract the project with the highest profit.

3. **Iterate to Select Projects:**
   - Start with the initial capital.
   - For up to `k` projects, add all projects that can be afforded with the current capital to the max-heap.
   - Extract the most profitable project from the max-heap and add its profit to the current capital.
   - If no more projects can be afforded, break out of the loop early.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n log n + k log n)***, where `n` is the number of projects. Sorting the projects takes `O(n log n)`, and each insertion and extraction operation on the max-heap takes `O(log n)`. In the worst case, we might perform `k` such operations.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)*** for storing the projects and the max-heap.

# Code

```typescript
function findMaximizedCapital(k: number, w: number, profits: number[], capital: number[]): number {
    const n = profits.length;
    const projects = new Array(n).fill(0).map((_, i) => [capital[i], profits[i]]);
    
    projects.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    const maxHeap = new MaxHeap<number>();
    let index = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        while (index < n && projects[index][0] <= w) {
            maxHeap.insert(projects[index][1]);
            index++;
        }
        
        if (maxHeap.size() === 0) break;
        
        w += maxHeap.extractMax();
    }
    
    return w;
