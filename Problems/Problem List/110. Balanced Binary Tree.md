[110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

# Intuition

To determine if a binary tree is height-balanced, we can approach it recursively:

1. **Calculate Heights**: For each node in the tree, calculate the height of its left subtree and its right subtree.
2. **Check Balance**: For each node, check if the height difference between its left and right subtrees is no more than 1.
3. **Recursive Approach**: Recursively apply the above steps to each node in the tree.
# Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach where we calculate the height of the tree for each node and check if it is height-balanced. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Recursive Function**: Write a recursive function `isBalanced` that calculates the height of the subtree for each node and checks if it is balanced.
   - The base case is when the current node is `null`, which has a height of -1 and is considered balanced.
   
2. **Calculate Heights**: For each node, recursively calculate the height of its left and right subtrees.
   - If any subtree is found to be unbalanced (difference in heights > 1), propagate this information up the call stack.
   
3. **Check Balance**: At each node, check if the absolute difference in heights between the left and right subtrees is less than or equal to 1.
   - If both subtrees are balanced, then the current node is also balanced.
   
4. **Return Result**: Start the recursion from the root of the tree and return `true` if the entire tree is balanced, `false` otherwise.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree. This represents the space used by the recursion stack.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function isBalanced(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    function checkBalance(node: TreeNode | null): number {
        if (node === null) return 0;
        
        const leftHeight = checkBalance(node.left);
        const rightHeight = checkBalance(node.right);
        
        if (leftHeight === -1 || rightHeight === -1 || Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
    
    return checkBalance(root) !== -1;
};
