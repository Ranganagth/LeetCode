[301. Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-invalid-parentheses/)

# Intuition

We need to generate all possible strings by removing the **minimum** number of invalid parentheses and return only those strings that are **valid**.

The key idea is to use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to explore all valid possibilities, starting with the original string. The first time we find a valid expression (balanced parentheses), we **stop at that level**, ensuring minimum removals.

---

# Approach

1. Use a **queue** to perform BFS starting from the original string.
2. For each string:
   * If it's valid, store it in the result.
   * Otherwise, generate all possible strings by removing **one parenthesis** and add them to the queue.
3. Use a **set** to avoid reprocessing the same string.
4. As soon as valid strings are found at one level of BFS, **stop further exploration** of deeper levels.
5. Return the collected valid strings.

### Validation Helper Function

A helper function checks whether a string has valid parentheses by simulating a stack using a counter.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** $O(2^n)$ in the worst case (due to generating all subsets), but significantly reduced by early pruning and memoization.
* **Space:** $O(n * m)$ where `n` is the number of generated strings and `m` is their average length.

# Code

```ts
function removeInvalidParentheses(s: string): string[] {
    const isValid = (str: string): boolean => {
        let count = 0;
        for (const ch of str) {
            if (ch === '(') count++;
            else if (ch === ')') {
                count--;
                if (count < 0) return false;
            }
        }
        return count === 0;
    };

    const result: string[] = [];
    const visited = new Set<string>();
    const queue: string[] = [s];
    let found = false;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift()!;
        if (isValid(current)) {
            result.push(current);
            found = true;
        }

        if (found) continue; // Don't go deeper if valid string found at this level

        for (let i = 0; i < current.length; i++) {
            if (current[i] !== '(' && current[i] !== ')') continue;

            const next = current.slice(0, i) + current.slice(i + 1);
            if (!visited.has(next)) {
                visited.add(next);
                queue.push(next);
            }
        }
    }

    return result.length > 0 ? result : [""];
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `"(a)())()"`

* Level 0: `"(a)())()"` (invalid)
* Level 1: remove one parenthesis at each position → `"(a())()"`, `"(a)()()"`, etc.
* First valid level found: return all valid strings from that level → `["(a())()", "(a)()()"]`

#### Input: `")("`

* Only invalid strings at first level.
* Next level: removing each parenthesis → `""`
* Valid → Output: `[""]`

---

### **Summary**

This problem is effectively solved using BFS with early stopping and pruning, and ensures that the returned strings are the result of minimum deletions. It is optimal in terms of correctness and performance for the given constraints.
