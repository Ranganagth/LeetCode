[2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

# Intuition
When adding two numbers represented as linked lists in reverse order, we can simulate the addition process digit by digit, much like how we would do it manually. Starting from the least significant digit, we add corresponding digits from both lists along with any carry from the previous addition.

# Approach
1. Initialize a dummy head node to simplify the result list handling.
2. Use a pointer `current` to build the resulting linked list.
3. Initialize a variable `carry` to 0 to keep track of any carry-over value during the addition.
4. Traverse both linked lists simultaneously:
   - Add the values from the corresponding nodes of both lists along with the `carry`.
   - Create a new node with the digit part of the sum and append it to the result list.
   - Update the `carry` to be the quotient of the sum divided by 10.
5. After the loop, if there is any remaining `carry`, create a new node with that value.
6. Return the next node of the dummy head, which is the start of the result list.

# Explanation
- We start by creating a dummy head node to serve as the starting point of the result list. This helps in handling edge cases and simplifies list construction.
- We traverse both linked lists using a `while` loop that continues until both lists are exhausted.
- Inside the loop, we compute the sum of the current digits from both lists and the carry from the previous addition.
- We create a new node for the digit part of the sum (`sum % 10`) and update the `carry` to `Math.floor(sum / 10)`.
- After traversing both lists, if there's a remaining carry, we create a final node to include it.
- Finally, we return the next node of the dummy head, which gives us the required sum as a linked list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - We traverse each list exactly once, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the longer list.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***
  - The space complexity is also linear because we create a new linked list to store the result, which in the worst case could be as long as the sum of the lengths of the input lists plus one extra node for the final carry.

# Code
```typescript
function addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode(0); 
    let current = dummyHead;
    let carry = 0;

    while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null) {
        let sum = carry;
        if (l1 !== null) {
            sum += l1.val;
            l1 = l1.next;
        }
        if (l2 !== null) {
            sum += l2.val;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10); 
        current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10); 
        current = current.next; 
    }

    if (carry > 0) {
        current.next = new ListNode(carry);
    }

    return dummyHead.next;
};
