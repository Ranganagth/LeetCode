[16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

# Intuition
To find three integers in the array `nums` such that their sum is closest to `target`, we can leverage a similar approach to the three-sum problem. Sorting the array and using a two-pointer technique will allow us to efficiently find the closest sum.

# Approach
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the closest sum using the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate and Fix:** Iterate through the array. For each element `nums[i]`, fix it as the first element of the triplet.
3. **Two-pointer Technique:** Use two pointers, `left` starting just after `i`, and `right` at the end of the array.
   - Calculate the sum `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.
   - Update the closest sum found if the current sum is closer to `target` than the previously recorded closest sum.
   - If the current sum is less than `target`, increment `left` to increase the sum.
   - If the current sum is greater than `target`, decrement `right` to decrease the sum.
4. **Return Result:** Return the closest sum found.

# Explanation
- By sorting the array, we ensure that similar numbers are close to each other, making it easier to find the closest sum using the two-pointer technique.
- The two-pointer technique allows us to search for the closest sum efficiently, with a complexity of O(n^2) after sorting.
- This method ensures that we find the closest possible sum to `target` without having to generate all possible sums directly.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n^2)***
  - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and finding the closest sum using two pointers takes O(n^2).
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The space complexity is constant, as we are only using a few extra variables.

# Code
```TypeScript
function threeSumClosest(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let closestSum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        let left = i + 1, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (Math.abs(sum - target) < Math.abs(closestSum - target)) {
                closestSum = sum;
            }
            if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else if (sum > target) {
                right--;
            } else {
                return sum;
            }
        }
    }

    return closestSum;
};
