[97. Interleaving String](https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/)

# Intuition

To determine whether `s3` can be formed by interleaving strings `s1` and `s2`, we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

# Approach

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find out if `s3` can be formed by interleaving characters from `s1` and `s2` without reordering characters from within `s1` and `s2`.
   - For example, if `s1 = "aabcc"`, `s2 = "dbbca"`, and `s3 = "aadbbcbcac"`, then `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be a boolean representing whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can interleave to form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.
   - If `dp[i][j]` is true, it means there exists at least one way to form the first `i+j` characters of `s3` using the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2`.
   
3. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0] = true`, because two empty strings interleave to form an empty string.
   - Initialize the first row `dp[0][j]` and the first column `dp[i][0]` based on whether the characters match `s3`.

4. **Transition**:
   - If the current character of `s1` matches `s3`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
   - If the current character of `s2` matches `s3`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]`.
   - If both characters match, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] || dp[i][j-1]`.
   
5. **Result**:
   - Return `dp[m][n]`, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of `s2`, for storing the `dp` array.

# Code
```typescript
function isInterleave(s1: string, s2: string, s3: string): boolean {
    const m = s1.length;
    const n = s2.length;
    const p = s3.length;
    
    if (m + n !== p) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const dp: boolean[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(false));
    
    dp[0][0] = true;
    
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] && s2[j - 1] === s3[j - 1];
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] && s1[i - 1] === s3[i - 1];
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] && s1[i - 1] === s3[i + j - 1]) ||
                       (dp[i][j - 1] && s2[j - 1] === s3[i + j - 1]);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `m`, `n`, and `p` represent the lengths of `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` respectively.
   - Check if `s1` and `s2` together have the same length as `s3`. If not, return false.
   - Initialize a `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s1` and the first `j` characters of `s2` can interleave to form the first `i+j` characters of `s3`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][0] = true`, because two empty strings interleave to form an empty string.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - Fill the first row and column based on whether the characters match with `s3`.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, update `dp[i][j]` based on the previous states.

4. **Result**:
   - Return `dp[m][n]`, which indicates whether `s3` can be formed by interleaving `s1` and `s2`.
