[383. Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/)

# Intuition
To determine if `ransomNote` can be constructed from `magazine`, we need to check if every character in `ransomNote` can be found in `magazine` with sufficient frequency. We can use a counting approach to efficiently compare the characters.

# Approach
1. **Count Characters in `magazine`**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in `magazine`.
2. **Check `ransomNote` Characters**: For each character in `ransomNote`, check if it exists in the frequency counter with a sufficient count. Decrement the count in the counter as we use each character.
3. **Return Result**: If any character in `ransomNote` cannot be matched with `magazine`, return `false`. If all characters can be matched, return `true`.

# Explanation
1. **Frequency Counter**: Use a hash map (or array for fixed alphabet size) to store the frequency of each character in `magazine`.
2. **Validation**: Traverse through each character in `ransomNote` and check the frequency counter. If a character is not available or its count is exhausted, return `false`.
3. **Completion**: If all characters are validated successfully, return `true`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` is the length of `ransomNote` and `m` is the length of `magazine`. We traverse both strings once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, since the size of the frequency counter is limited to 26 (the number of lowercase English letters).

# Code
```typescript
function canConstruct(ransomNote: string, magazine: string): boolean {
    const charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const aCharCode = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    for (let char of magazine) {
        charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode]++;
    }

    for (let char of ransomNote) {
        if (charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode] === 0) {
            return false;
        }
        charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode]--;
    }

    return true;
};

```
