[1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/)

# Intuition

The problem can be modeled as finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) between `nums1` and `nums2`. The reason for this is that the longest sequence of uncrossed lines corresponds to the longest sequence of common elements that appear in the same order in both arrays.

# Approach

To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming (DP). We define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `nums1` up to index `i-1` and `nums2` up to index `j-1`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a 2D DP array with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
   - All elements of `dp` are initially set to 0.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`. This means the current elements match, and we can extend the LCS by 1.
   - If `nums1[i-1] != nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`. This means the current elements do not match, and the LCS length is the maximum of ignoring the current element in either `nums1` or `nums2`.

3. **Result**:
   - The value `dp[m][n]` will contain the length of the longest common subsequence, which corresponds to the maximum number of uncrossed lines.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** where *m* and *n* are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** for the DP array.

# Code
```typescript
function maxUncrossedLines(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
    const m = nums1.length;
    const n = nums2.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (nums1[i - 1] === nums2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[m][n];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We create a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros.
2. **DP Transition**:
   - We iterate through each element of `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - If the elements match, we extend the LCS by 1 from the previous LCS found at `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If they don't match, we take the maximum value between ignoring the current element of either `nums1` or `nums2`.
3. **Return Result**: The value at `dp[m][n]` gives the length of the longest common subsequence, which is our desired result.
