[93. Restore IP Addresses](https://leetcode.com/problems/restore-ip-addresses/)

# Intuition
1. **Backtracking**: We'll use a recursive function to try all possible placements of dots in the string `s`.
2. **Validation**: At each step, we'll validate if the substring formed by placing a dot is a valid IP address component.
3. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when we have placed exactly three dots and have checked all the remaining characters.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking Function**: We'll define a recursive function to generate valid IP addresses by placing dots.
    - The function will take the current index in the string `s`, the number of dots placed so far, and the current IP address being formed.
    - At each step, we'll try placing a dot after the current character and validate if the resulting substring forms a valid IP address component.
    - If so, we'll recurse with the next index and update the IP address.
    - We'll continue this process until we have placed exactly three dots, and the remaining substring forms a valid IP address component.
2. **Validation Function**: We'll define a helper function to validate if a substring is a valid IP address component.
    - We'll check if the substring has leading zeros, is within the range [0, 255], and has no extra leading or trailing characters.
3. **Result Collection**: During the backtracking process, we'll collect all valid IP addresses.

# Complexity Analysis
- **Time complexity** of this approach is ***O(3‚Å¥) = O(1)*** since we have exactly four components in an IP address, and each component can have at most three digits. 
- The **Space Complexity** is ***O(1)***.

# Code
```typescript
function restoreIpAddresses(s: string): string[] {
    const result: string[] = [];

    function backtrack(index: number, dots: number, ip: string[]) {
        if (dots === 3) {
            const remaining = s.slice(index);
            if (isValidComponent(remaining)) {
                ip.push(remaining);
                result.push(ip.join('.'));
                ip.pop();
            }
            return;
        }

        for (let i = 1; i <= 3 && index + i <= s.length; i++) {
            const component = s.slice(index, index + i);
            if (isValidComponent(component)) {
                ip.push(component);
                backtrack(index + i, dots + 1, ip);
                ip.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    function isValidComponent(component: string): boolean {
        if (component.length > 1 && component[0] === '0') return false;
        const num = parseInt(component);
        return num >= 0 && num <= 255;
    }

    backtrack(0, 0, []);
    return result;
};

```
