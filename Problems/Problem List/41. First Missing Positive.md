[41. First Missing Positive](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/)

# Intuition
To find the smallest positive integer that is not present in an unsorted array, we can leverage the property that the smallest missing positive integer must lie within the range from 1 to `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the array. By placing each number in its corresponding position (1 in index 0, 2 in index 1, etc.), we can easily identify the missing integer by checking the positions.

# Approach
1. **Index Placement**: Iterate through the array and attempt to place each number `num` at the position `num - 1` if `num` is within the valid range (1 to n). We do this in a loop to ensure each number is placed correctly even if it requires multiple swaps.
2. **Identify Missing Number**: After rearranging, iterate through the array again to find the first position where the index does not match the value (i.e., index `i` does not have `i + 1`). This index indicates the smallest missing positive integer.
3. **Edge Case**: If all positions from 1 to n are correctly placed, then the missing integer must be `n + 1`.

# Explanation
1. **Index Placement**:
   - For each number in the array, we attempt to place it in its correct position using a while loop to swap values until the number is either out of range or already in its correct position.
   - This process ensures that every number that can be placed correctly is placed.
2. **Identify Missing Number**:
   - After rearrangement, we scan the array to find the first position `i` where `nums[i]` is not `i + 1`.
   - If all positions are correct, the smallest missing positive is `n + 1`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, as each number is placed at most once and we have two passes through the array.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are modifying the array in place and using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function firstMissingPositive(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] !== nums[i]) {
            [nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i]] = [nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]];
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== i + 1) {
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return n + 1;
};

```
