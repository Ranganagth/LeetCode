[306. Additive Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/additive-number/)

### Problem Overview

You're given a **string of digits**. You must determine whether it can be split into an **additive sequence**:

* A sequence where every number (starting from the third) is the **sum of the previous two**.
* Must have **at least 3 numbers**.
* **No leading zeros** allowed unless the number is exactly `"0"`.

---

# Intuition

This problem involves **splitting the string** into candidate numbers and then **validating the additive rule** recursively.

Since the numbers can be arbitrarily large and are represented as strings, we cannot safely use regular number types. We need to use **string-based addition** to handle potential overflows.

---

# Approach

1. **Try all possible first and second number splits**:
   * First number ends at position `i`
   * Second number ends at position `j`

2. For each such pair `(num1, num2)`:
   * If either has leading zeros and length > 1, skip it.
   * Repeatedly compute `sum = num1 + num2` (using string addition).
   * Check whether the remaining string starts with that sum.
   * Move the window forward and repeat until the end.

3. If any valid sequence is found, return `true`.

### **String Addition Helper**

Since input numbers can be large (up to 35 digits), use a helper to perform **string-based addition** (like manual column addition).

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **O(n³)**:
  * Two nested loops to pick `num1` and `num2` — O(n²)
  * Then each validation may scan rest of the string — O(n)
  * Total: `O(n³)`, which is acceptable since n ≤ 35

# Code

```ts
function isAdditiveNumber(num: string): boolean {
    const n = num.length;

    // Helper to add two string numbers
    function addStrings(a: string, b: string): string {
        let i = a.length - 1, j = b.length - 1;
        let carry = 0, res = "";
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
            const sum = (i >= 0 ? +a[i--] : 0) + (j >= 0 ? +b[j--] : 0) + carry;
            res = (sum % 10) + res;
            carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        }
        return res;
    }

    // Try all possible first and second numbers
    for (let i = 1; i <= Math.floor(n / 2); i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; n - j >= Math.max(i, j - i); j++) {
            let num1 = num.slice(0, i);
            let num2 = num.slice(i, j);

            if ((num1.length > 1 && num1[0] === '0') || (num2.length > 1 && num2[0] === '0')) {
                continue;
            }

            let k = j;
            while (k < n) {
                let sum = addStrings(num1, num2);
                if (!num.startsWith(sum, k)) break;
                k += sum.length;
                num1 = num2;
                num2 = sum;
            }

            if (k === n) return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input: `"112358"`

* Try `num1 = "1"`, `num2 = "1"`
* `sum = "2"` → matched
* then `sum = "3"` → matched
* then `sum = "5"` → matched
* then `sum = "8"` → matched
* End of string reached → valid sequence → return `true`

#### Input: `"199100199"`

* Try `num1 = "1"`, `num2 = "99"`
* `sum = "100"` → matched
* `sum = "199"` → matched
* End of string reached → valid sequence → return `true`

---

### Summary

* **Validates all possible number partitions** with no leading zeros.
* Handles **large numbers** by using string addition.
* **Time complexity**: `O(n³)` but acceptable for `n ≤ 35`.
