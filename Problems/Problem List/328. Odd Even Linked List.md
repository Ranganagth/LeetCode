[328. Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

### Problem Summary

You're given the head of a singly linked list. You must:
* Group all nodes at **odd indices** first, followed by all nodes at **even indices**.
* Maintain **relative order** within the odd and even groups.
* Solve in **O(n) time** and **O(1) space**.

---

# Intuition

* Treat the linked list as a sequence of positions:
  * Odd indexed: `1st, 3rd, 5th, ...`
  * Even indexed: `2nd, 4th, 6th, ...`
  
* Use two pointers:
  * `odd`: tracks the tail of the odd-indexed list.
  * `even`: tracks the tail of the even-indexed list.
  
* Also keep `evenHead` to remember the head of the even list for final merging.

---

# Approach

1. Edge case: If the list has 0 or 1 nodes, return head.
2. Initialize:
   * `odd` = head
   * `even` = head.next
   * `evenHead` = head.next
3. Traverse the list:
   * Update odd’s next to point to the node after even.
   * Move `odd` forward.
   * Update even’s next to point to the node after odd.
   * Move `even` forward.
4. When done, link the tail of the odd list to the head of the even list.
5. Return the modified head.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) — Every node is visited once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only pointers used, no extra data structures.

# Code

```ts
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.next = next ?? null;
    }
}

function oddEvenList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;

    let odd = head;
    let even = head.next;
    let evenHead = even;

    while (even && even.next) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;

        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }

    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

* Initial:
  * odd = 1
  * even = 2
  * evenHead = 2

Step-by-step:
* odd.next = 3, odd = 3
* even.next = 4, even = 4
* odd.next = 5, odd = 5
* even.next = null, done

Final:

* odd.next = evenHead (2)

**Result:** `1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4`

---

#### **Example 2**

Input: `2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4 -> 7`

Output: `2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4`

---

### **Summary**

This solution efficiently separates and merges odd/even indexed nodes in a single pass using pointer manipulation. It ensures in-place operation with constant extra space.
