[71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/)

# Intuition
To simplify the given absolute Unix-style file path, we need to interpret various components and transform it into its canonical form. Here's how we can achieve this:

# Approach

1. **Splitting the Path**: First, split the input path using the slash ('/') as the delimiter. This gives us an array of path components.

2. **Processing Each Component**:
   - Ignore empty strings and the current directory symbol ('.').
   - For the parent directory symbol ('..'), remove the last directory from the result if it's not empty and not the root directory.
   - For all other valid directory names, add them to the result.

3. **Constructing the Simplified Path**:
   - Join the valid components into a single string, separated by slashes ('/').
   - Ensure the resulting path starts with a single slash ('/') to indicate the root directory.
   - Remove any trailing slash unless the resulting path is the root directory.

### Example

For example, given the input path "/home/user/Documents/../Pictures":
- Splitting gives: ["", "home", "user", "Documents", "..", "Pictures"]
- Processing each component leads to: ["", "home", "user", "Pictures"]
- Joining results in: "/home/user/Pictures"

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the input path. We essentially perform a single pass through the path components.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the path components and the result.

# Code

```typescript
function simplifyPath(path: string): string {
    const components = path.split('/');
    const stack: string[] = [];

    for (const component of components) {
        if (component === '' || component === '.') {
            continue;
        } else if (component === '..') {
            if (stack.length > 0) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push(component);
        }
    }

    const result = '/' + stack.join('/');
    return result === '/' ? result : result.replace(/\/$/, '');
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Splitting the Path**: We split the input path using `split('/')`, which gives us an array `components` containing each directory or file name from the path.

2. **Processing Each Component**: We iterate through each component:
   - Ignore empty components and current directory components ('.').
   - For parent directory components ('..'), pop the last component from the `stack` (our result array) if it's not empty and not the root directory.

3. **Constructing the Result**: After processing all components, join the valid components in `stack` with slashes ('/'), prepend a slash to indicate the root directory, and handle the edge case where the resulting path might end with a trailing slash.
