[287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

# Intuition

This problem can be visualized as a **cycle detection problem** using **Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm**.

Since all numbers are between `1` and `n`, and there are `n + 1` elements, **the array forms a cycle** in a conceptual linked list, where each index points to `nums[i]`.

The repeated number forms a **cycle** because it points to an already-visited node.

# Approach 
(Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare)

1. **Phase 1: Detect Intersection Point**

   * Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to find an intersection inside the cycle.
   * `slow` moves by 1 step: `slow = nums[slow]`
   * `fast` moves by 2 steps: `fast = nums[nums[fast]]`

2. **Phase 2: Find Entrance to Cycle (Duplicate Number)**

   * Reinitialize `slow` to start of array.
   * Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time.
   * The point where they meet is the duplicate number.

## Why It Works

* Think of each element as a node pointing to another node (`nums[i]`).
* Due to the pigeonhole principle, a cycle must exist.
* Floyd’s algorithm detects the cycle and finds the entry point (duplicate).

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

# Code

```ts
function findDuplicate(nums: number[]): number {
    let slow = nums[0];
    let fast = nums[0];

    // Phase 1: Find intersection point
    do {
        slow = nums[slow];
        fast = nums[nums[fast]];
    } while (slow !== fast);

    // Phase 2: Find entrance to cycle
    slow = nums[0];
    while (slow !== fast) {
        slow = nums[slow];
        fast = nums[fast];
    }

    return slow;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input:** `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`

```
nums[0] = 1
nums[1] = 3
nums[3] = 2
nums[2] = 4
nums[4] = 2 ← cycle
```

* Phase 1:

  * slow = 1 → 3 → 2
  * fast = 1 → 2 → 4 → 2 → ...

* Phase 2:

  * slow starts from 0: 1 → 3 → 2
  * fast starts from 2
  * Both meet at 2 ⇒ duplicate

### **Follow-Up: Why a Duplicate Must Exist**

Because there are `n + 1` values in the range `[1, n]`, **pigeonhole principle** guarantees at least one number repeats.
