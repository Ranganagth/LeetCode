[30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/)

# Intuition
To find all starting indices of concatenated substrings in string `s` that are permutations of words in the array `words`, we can use a sliding window technique with a hashmap to efficiently check for valid substrings.

# Approach
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a hashmap `wordsMap` to store the frequency of each word in `words`.
   - Determine `wordLen` as the length of any word in `words`.
   - Calculate `concatLen` as the total length of concatenated substrings (`words.length * wordLen`).

2. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Iterate over possible starting indices `start` from 0 to `wordLen`.
   - Use a hashmap `windowMap` to keep track of words in the current window of size `concatLen`.
   - Slide the window across `s` with a step size of `wordLen`.
   - For each position `start`, check substrings of length `concatLen`.
   - If a substring is found that is a permutation of `words`, record the starting index.

3. **Check Permutations:**
   - For each substring, create a hashmap `currMap` to count occurrences of words.
   - Compare `currMap` with `wordsMap` to determine if the substring is a permutation of `words`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `s` is shorter than `concatLen`, return an empty array immediately.

5. **Return:**
   - Return the list of starting indices of valid concatenated substrings.

# Explanation
- This approach efficiently finds all starting indices of concatenated substrings by leveraging a sliding window technique and hashmap comparisons to check for permutations.
- The use of hashmap ensures that the solution is optimal and runs in linear time relative to the length of `s`.
- This method is particularly effective due to its avoidance of generating all possible permutations directly, which would be computationally expensive.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O((n - m) * m)***
  - Where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `words[0]`.
  - The sliding window iterates over each position in `s` and checks substrings of length `concatLen`.
- Space complexity: ***O(m + n)***
  - The space required for `wordsMap`, `windowMap`, and other variables is linear with respect to the input size.

# Code
```TypeScript
function findSubstring(s: string, words: string[]): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    if (s.length === 0 || words.length === 0) {
        return result;
    }
    
    const wordsMap: Map<string, number> = new Map();
    for (const word of words) {
        wordsMap.set(word, (wordsMap.get(word) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const wordLen = words[0].length;
    const concatLen = words.length * wordLen;
    
    for (let start = 0; start < wordLen; start++) {
        let left = start;
        let right = start;
        const windowMap: Map<string, number> = new Map();
        
        while (right + wordLen <= s.length) {
            const word = s.substring(right, right + wordLen);
            right += wordLen;
            
            if (!wordsMap.has(word)) {
                windowMap.clear();
                left = right;
            } else {
                windowMap.set(word, (windowMap.get(word) || 0) + 1);
                
                while (windowMap.get(word) > wordsMap.get(word)) {
                    const removeWord = s.substring(left, left + wordLen);
                    windowMap.set(removeWord, windowMap.get(removeWord)! - 1);
                    left += wordLen;
                }
                
                if (right - left === concatLen) {
                    result.push(left);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
