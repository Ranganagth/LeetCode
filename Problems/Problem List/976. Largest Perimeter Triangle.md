[976. Largest Perimeter Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-perimeter-triangle/)

# Intuition

To form a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), the triangle inequality must hold: a + b > c

This condition ensures that the sum of the two shorter sides is greater than the longest side, making it possible to form a triangle with a non-zero area.

To maximize the perimeter of such a triangle, it's beneficial to sort the array in non-decreasing order and then check the largest possible triplet that satisfies the triangle inequality.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array in descending order.
2. **Check Triangle Inequality**: Starting from the largest elements, check if the sum of any two smaller elements is greater than the largest element. If the condition is satisfied, return the perimeter of these three sides.
3. **Return 0 if No Triangle is Found**: If no such triplet satisfies the condition, return 0.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function largestPerimeter(nums: number[]): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]) {
            return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2];
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We sort the array in descending order so that the largest potential perimeter is considered first.
2. **Iterating**: We iterate through the sorted array and check if the current element can form a triangle with the next two elements.
3. **Condition Check**: For a triplet \([a, b, c]\) (with \(a \geq b \geq c\)), the triangle inequality condition \(b + c > a\) is checked. If this is true, the perimeter is returned.
4. **Return 0**: If no such triplet satisfies the condition, return 0, indicating that a triangle cannot be formed.
