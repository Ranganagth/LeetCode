[223. Rectangle Area](https://leetcode.com/problems/rectangle-area/)
# Intuition

We are given two rectangles, each defined by their bottom-left and top-right coordinates. We want to calculate the **total area covered** by both rectangles, making sure we **don’t double-count** the overlapping region.

# Approach

1. **Calculate the Area of Each Rectangle Individually**:
   * Area of rectangle A = `(ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)`
   * Area of rectangle B = `(bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)`

2. **Calculate the Overlap (if any)**:
   * For the overlap to exist, both x and y intervals must intersect.
   * The overlapping rectangle (if exists) has:
     * Left: `max(ax1, bx1)`
     * Right: `min(ax2, bx2)`
     * Bottom: `max(ay1, by1)`
     * Top: `min(ay2, by2)`
   * Overlap width: `max(0, min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1))`
   * Overlap height: `max(0, min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1))`
   * Overlap area = width × height

3. **Total Area** = Area of A + Area of B - Overlap Area

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` — All calculations are constant-time operations.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — No extra space used.

# Code

```typescript
function computeArea(ax1: number, ay1: number, ax2: number, ay2: number, bx1: number, by1: number, bx2: number, by2: number): number {
    const areaA = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1);
    const areaB = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1);

    const overlapWidth = Math.max(0, Math.min(ax2, bx2) - Math.max(ax1, bx1));
    const overlapHeight = Math.max(0, Math.min(ay2, by2) - Math.max(ay1, by1));

    const overlapArea = overlapWidth * overlapHeight;

    return areaA + areaB - overlapArea;
};

```

### **Examples and Explanation**

#### Example 1:

```ts
Input: ax1 = -3, ay1 = 0, ax2 = 3, ay2 = 4
       bx1 = 0,  by1 = -1, bx2 = 9, by2 = 2
```

* Area A = (3 - (-3)) * (4 - 0) = 6 * 4 = 24
* Area B = (9 - 0) * (2 - (-1)) = 9 * 3 = 27
* Overlap:

  * Width = min(3, 9) - max(-3, 0) = 3 - 0 = 3
  * Height = min(4, 2) - max(0, -1) = 2 - 0 = 2
  * Overlap area = 3 * 2 = 6
* Total = 24 + 27 - 6 = **45**

#### Example 2:

```ts
Input: ax1 = -2, ay1 = -2, ax2 = 2, ay2 = 2
       bx1 = -2, by1 = -2, bx2 = 2, by2 = 2
```

* Both rectangles are identical
* Area A = 4 * 4 = 16
* Area B = 4 * 4 = 16
* Overlap = 4 * 4 = 16
* Total = 16 + 16 - 16 = **16**

### **Summary**

This problem is a straightforward geometry problem where we calculate area using rectangle dimensions and subtract overlapping regions. The key is to ensure correct handling of overlapping width and height, which should never be negative.
