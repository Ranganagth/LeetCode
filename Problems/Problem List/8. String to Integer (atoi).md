[8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/)
# Intuition
The problem requires converting a string into a 32-bit signed integer based on specific rules:
1. Ignore leading whitespace.
2. Handle an optional leading sign ('+' or '-').
3. Read numeric characters until a non-numeric character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.
4. Ensure the resulting integer falls within the range [-231, 231 - 1], rounding if necessary.

# Approach
1. Trim leading whitespace from the string.
2. Check for an optional sign ('+' or '-').
3. Read numeric characters until a non-numeric character is found or the end of the string is reached.
4. Convert the substring of numeric characters into an integer.
5. Ensure the integer is within the range [-231, 231 - 1] by applying rounding if necessary.
6. Return the integer.

# Explanation
- We start by trimming any leading whitespace.
- We check for an optional sign ('+' or '-') and determine the sign of the resulting integer.
- We read numeric characters until a non-numeric character is encountered or the end of the string is reached.
- We convert the substring of numeric characters into an integer.
- We handle integer overflow by checking if the integer is outside the range [-231, 231 - 1] and applying rounding.
- Finally, we return the resulting integer.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - We iterate through the string `s` once.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function myAtoi(s: string): number {
    let i = 0;
    const n = s.length;
    let sign = 1;
    let result = 0;
    
    while (i < n && s[i] === ' ') {
        i++;
    }
    
    if (s[i] === '+' || s[i] === '-') {
        sign = s[i] === '-' ? -1 : 1;
        i++;
    }
    
    while (i < n && s[i] >= '0' && s[i] <= '9') {
        const digit = Number(s[i]);
        if (result > Math.floor((2147483647 - digit) / 10)) {
            return sign === 1 ? 2147483647 : -2147483648;
        }
        result = result * 10 + digit;
        i++;
    }
    
    return result * sign;
};
