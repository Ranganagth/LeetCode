[165. Compare Version Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/compare-version-numbers/)

# Intuition

To compare two version strings, we can split each version string into its respective revisions. We then compare the corresponding revisions from each version string one by one. If the number of revisions in one version string is less than the other, we consider the missing revisions as 0. This way, we can accurately determine which version is greater, lesser, or if they are equal.

# Approach

1. **Split the Version Strings**: Split each version string by the dot `.` to get an array of revisions.
2. **Normalize the Length**: Ensure both arrays have the same length by considering missing revisions as 0.
3. **Compare Revisions**: Iterate through the revisions, comparing each corresponding pair of revisions:
   - If a revision from `version1` is greater than the corresponding revision from `version2`, return 1.
   - If a revision from `version1` is less than the corresponding revision from `version2`, return -1.
   - If they are equal, move to the next revision.
4. **Return 0 if Equal**: If all corresponding revisions are equal, return 0.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the maximum number of revisions in the two version strings.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the split revisions.

# Code
```typescript
function compareVersion(version1: string, version2: string): number {
    const v1 = version1.split('.');
    const v2 = version2.split('.');

    const n = Math.max(v1.length, v2.length);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const num1 = i < v1.length ? parseInt(v1[i]) : 0;
        const num2 = i < v2.length ? parseInt(v2[i]) : 0;

        if (num1 > num2) return 1;
        if (num1 < num2) return -1;
    }

    return 0;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Splitting the Version Strings**: We use the `split('.')` method to break down the version strings into arrays of revisions.
2. **Normalizing Lengths**: By setting `n` to the maximum length of the two arrays, we ensure we compare every revision, treating missing revisions as 0.
3. **Comparing Revisions**: We use a loop to compare each revision. The `parseInt` function converts the revision strings to integers, and we handle missing revisions by considering them as 0.
4. **Returning Results**: The function returns 1 if `version1` is greater, -1 if `version1` is lesser, and 0 if both versions are equal after comparing all revisions.
