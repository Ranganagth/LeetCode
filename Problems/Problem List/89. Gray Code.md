[89. Gray Code](https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/)

# Intuition
The n-bit Gray code sequence is a sequence of 2^n integers that meets specific criteria, most notably that the binary representation of each integer in the sequence differs by exactly one bit from the previous and next integers. The construction of Gray codes can be elegantly achieved through a known pattern: using the binary-reflected Gray code construction.

# Approach
1. **Binary-reflected Gray Code**:
    - The sequence starts with `0`.
    - For each subsequent bit position, reflect the existing sequence and prepend `1` to the reflected sequence.
2. **Iterative Construction**:
    - Start with the base case for 1-bit Gray code: `[0, 1]`.
    - For each additional bit, reflect the current sequence and prepend `1` to each of the reflected values.
    - Merge the original sequence with the reflected sequence to get the new sequence.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)*** due to the generation of 2^n integers.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)*** for storing the sequence.

# Code
```typescript
function grayCode(n: number): number[] {
    let result = [0];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const size = result.length;
        for (let j = size - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            result.push(result[j] | (1 << i));
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with the base sequence `[0]`.
2. **Iterative Construction**:
    - For each bit position from 0 to n-1:
        - Determine the current length of the sequence.
        - Reflect the sequence by iterating backwards.
        - For each reflected value, add `2ⁱ` to effectively prepend `1` in the binary representation.
3. **Output**: The final sequence after processing all bits gives the required Gray code sequence.
