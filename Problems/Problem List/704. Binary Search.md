[704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

# Intuition

Since the array is sorted in ascending order and we need to achieve a time complexity of \( O(\log n) \), we can utilize **binary search**. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the target is less than the middle element, we search the left half; otherwise, we search the right half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - We start by defining two pointers: `left` pointing to the start of the array and `right` pointing to the end.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, we compute the `mid` index as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - If `nums[mid]` equals the target, we return `mid`.
   - If the target is smaller than `nums[mid]`, we move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
   - If the target is greater than `nums[mid]`, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.

3. **Return -1 if not found**:
   - If we exit the loop and haven't found the target, return `-1`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because each iteration of the binary search cuts the search space in half.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we're using only a few variables for pointers and indices.

# Code

```typescript
function search(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] > target) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(search([-1,0,3,5,9,12], 9));  // Output: 4
console.log(search([-1,0,3,5,9,12], 2));  // Output: -1
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Input**:
   - `nums`: The sorted array of integers.
   - `target`: The number we want to search for.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We repeatedly calculate the middle index (`mid`) and compare it with the target.
   - Depending on the comparison, we either continue the search in the left half (if `nums[mid]` is greater than the target) or the right half (if `nums[mid]` is less than the target).

3. **Return**:
   - If the target is found, its index is returned.
   - If the loop completes and the target is not found, `-1` is returned.

### Example Walkthrough

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]`, `target = 9`
   - Initial pointers: `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `mid = 2` (value = 3)
   - 9 is greater than 3, so we search the right half: `left = 3`, `right = 5`
   - New `mid = 4` (value = 9)
   - 9 equals the target, so return 4.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]`, `target = 2`
   - Initial pointers: `left = 0`, `right = 5`, `mid = 2` (value = 3)
   - 2 is less than 3, so we search the left half: `left = 0`, `right = 1`
   - New `mid = 0` (value = -1)
   - 2 is greater than -1, so we search the right half: `left = 1`, `right = 1`
   - New `mid = 1` (value = 0)
   - 2 is greater than 0, so we search the right half: `left = 2`, `right = 1`
   - Since `left` is now greater than `right`, return -1 (target not found).
