[312. Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of bursting balloons for maximum coins, we can use dynamic programming. The key idea is to consider which balloon to burst last in each subarray of balloons. This approach allows us to break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each subproblem optimally, and use those solutions to build up the solution for the full problem.

# Approach

1. **DP Table Definition**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum coins obtainable from bursting all the balloons between index `i` and `j` (inclusive).

2. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - If there are no balloons to burst, `dp[i][j] = 0`.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each possible subarray of balloons from `i` to `j`, consider bursting each balloon `k` last. The coins gained from bursting balloon `k` last in this subarray would be `nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1]` plus the coins obtained from bursting balloons from `i` to `k-1` and `k+1` to `j`.
   - Hence, the recurrence relation is:
	    ```
			dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k-1] + nums[i-1] * nums[k] * nums[j+1] + dp[k+1][j])
		```

   - Here, `nums[i-1]` and `nums[j+1]` are treated as `1` if `i-1` or `j+1` is out of bounds.

4. **Initialization**:
   - Extend the original `nums` array by padding `1` at both ends to simplify the boundary condition handling.
   - Initialize `dp[i][i]` for single balloon subarrays based on their immediate neighbors.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The result for the full problem will be in `dp[1][n]` after considering all possible balloons to burst last in each subarray.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n³)*** because for each pair `(i, j)`, we are iterating over all possible `k` between `i` and `j`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** for storing the `dp` table.

# Code

```typescript
function maxCoins(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    const paddedNums = [1, ...nums, 1];
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n + 2 }, () => Array(n + 2).fill(0));

    for (let length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= n - length + 1; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            for (let k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], 
                    dp[i][k - 1] + paddedNums[i - 1] * paddedNums[k] * paddedNums[j + 1] + dp[k + 1][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[1][n];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Padding the Array**:
   - We pad the input array `nums` with `1` at the beginning and the end to handle edge cases easily.

2. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - We create a 2D array `dp` of size `(n+2) x (n+2)` initialized with `0`.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - We iterate over all possible lengths of subarrays.
   - For each subarray defined by `(i, j)`, we consider each balloon `k` in the subarray as the last balloon to burst.
   - We update `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum coins obtainable by bursting all balloons between `i` and `j`, with `k` being the last balloon burst.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The value in `dp[1][n]` gives the maximum coins obtainable by bursting all the balloons in the original array.
