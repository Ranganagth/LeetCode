[382. Linked List Random Node](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/)

# Intuition

To select a random node from a singly linked list with equal probability, we can use the **Reservoir Sampling** algorithm. This algorithm allows us to handle cases where the length of the linked list is unknown or extremely large. It ensures that each element in the list has an equal chance of being chosen.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: Store the head of the linked list.
2. **Random Selection**:
   - Traverse the linked list while maintaining a count of the nodes visited.
   - Use a random number generator to decide whether to select the current node.
   - Replace the previously selected node with the current node with probability \( \frac{1}{n} \) where \( n \) is the count of nodes seen so far.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Store the head of the linked list in the constructor.
   
2. **Get Random Node**:
   - Initialize variables to traverse the list and count nodes.
   - As you traverse each node, decide whether to select it using a random function.
   - Return the value of the selected node after traversing the entire list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for each call to `getRandom()`, where *n* is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we are not using any extra space proportional to the number of nodes.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

class Solution {
    private head: ListNode | null;

    constructor(head: ListNode | null) {
        this.head = head;
    }

    getRandom(): number {
        let result: number = -1;
        let current: ListNode | null = this.head;
        let count: number = 0;

        while (current !== null) {
            count++;
            if (Math.floor(Math.random() * count) === 0) {
                result = current.val;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: In the constructor, we simply store the head of the linked list.
2. **Random Selection**:
   - We initialize a variable to store the result and another to count the number of nodes.
   - As we traverse the list, we increment the count and decide whether to select the current node based on a random function.
   - If the random function returns 0, we update the result with the current node's value.
   - This ensures that each node has an equal probability of being selected.
