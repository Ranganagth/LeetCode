[88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

To merge two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array in place in `nums1`, we can utilize a two-pointer approach starting from the end of both arrays. This method ensures that we can fill the `nums1` array from the back to the front, which avoids overwriting elements in `nums1` that haven't been processed yet.

# Approach:
1. Initialize three pointers:
   - `p1` pointing to the last element of the first `m` elements in `nums1`.
   - `p2` pointing to the last element of `nums2`.
   - `p` pointing to the last position in the combined array (i.e., the end of `nums1`).

2. Compare the elements pointed to by `p1` and `p2`. Place the larger element at the position pointed to by `p` and move the respective pointer (`p1` or `p2`) and `p` backwards.

3. If one of the arrays is exhausted (e.g., all elements from `nums1` have been placed), continue copying the remaining elements from the other array.

4. Continue this process until all elements are merged.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m + n)*** because each element is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we are using the input arrays and only a few extra variables for pointers.

# Code
```typescript
function merge(nums1: number[], m: number, nums2: number[], n: number): void {
    let p1 = m - 1;
    let p2 = n - 1;
    let p = m + n - 1;
    
    while (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0) {
        if (nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {
            nums1[p] = nums1[p1];
            p1--;
        } else {
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2];
            p2--;
        }
        p--;
    }
    
    while (p2 >= 0) {
        nums1[p] = nums2[p2];
        p2--;
        p--;
    }
};

```

# Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `p1` to point to the last element of the valid part of `nums1`, `p2` to point to the last element of `nums2`, and `p` to point to the last position in `nums1`.

2. **Merging**: 
   - Compare `nums1[p1]` and `nums2[p2]`.
   - Place the larger of the two at `nums1[p]`.
   - Move the pointers `p1` or `p2` and `p` accordingly.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements**:
   - If `p2` has remaining elements, copy them to `nums1`. (Note: If `p1` has remaining elements, they are already in place.)
