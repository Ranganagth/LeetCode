[309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the maximum profit at each day considering different states:
1. **Holding a Stock**: The maximum profit we can have if we are holding a stock.
2. **Not Holding a Stock and in Cooldown**: The maximum profit if we are not holding a stock and are in a cooldown period (i.e., just sold a stock).
3. **Not Holding a Stock and Not in Cooldown**: The maximum profit if we are not holding a stock and are not in a cooldown period (i.e., ready to buy a stock).

# Approach

1. **Define the State Variables**:
   - `hold`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are holding a stock.
   - `cooldown`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are in a cooldown period.
   - `not_hold`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are not holding a stock and not in a cooldown period.

2. **State Transitions**:
   - If we are holding a stock on day `i`, it means we either bought it today or we carried it from yesterday:
     - `hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], not_hold[i-1] - prices[i])`
   - If we are in a cooldown period on day `i`, it means we sold the stock today:
     - `cooldown[i] = hold[i-1] + prices[i]`
   - If we are not holding a stock and not in a cooldown period on day `i`, it means we carried the state from yesterday or we just came out of a cooldown:
     - `not_hold[i] = max(not_hold[i-1], cooldown[i-1])`

3. **Initialization**:
   - On day 0, if we buy a stock:
     - `hold[0] = -prices[0]`
   - We cannot sell a stock on day 0:
     - `cooldown[0] = 0`
   - If we do nothing on day 0:
     - `not_hold[0] = 0`

4. **Final State**:
   - The answer will be the maximum profit on the last day either in cooldown or not holding a stock:
     - `max(cooldown[n-1], not_hold[n-1])`

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of days (prices.length).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the states. However, this can be optimized to ***O(1)*** by using only variables instead of arrays.

# Code
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    const n = prices.length;
    if (n == 0) return 0;

    let hold = Array(n).fill(0);
    let cooldown = Array(n).fill(0);
    let not_hold = Array(n).fill(0);

    hold[0] = -prices[0];
    cooldown[0] = 0;
    not_hold[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i - 1], not_hold[i - 1] - prices[i]);
        cooldown[i] = hold[i - 1] + prices[i];
        not_hold[i] = Math.max(not_hold[i - 1], cooldown[i - 1]);
    }

    return Math.max(cooldown[n - 1], not_hold[n - 1]);
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the initial values for `hold`, `cooldown`, and `not_hold` on day 0.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - Loop through each day from 1 to n-1.
   - Update the states based on the previous dayâ€™s states.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The result is the maximum value between the last day's cooldown and not holding states.
