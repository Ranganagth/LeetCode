[130. Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)

# Intuition
- Any 'O' on the border cannot be flipped because it cannot be completely surrounded by 'X's.
- Any 'O' connected to a border 'O' (directly or indirectly) should also not be flipped.
- Therefore, we can start from the borders and mark all the 'O's that should not be flipped. After this marking, any remaining 'O' can be safely flipped.

# Approach
1. **Mark Non-flippable 'O's**:
   - Use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse from each border cell that contains 'O' and mark all connected 'O's.
2. **Flip the Remaining 'O's**:
   - Iterate through the board and flip any 'O' that was not marked in the previous step.
3. **Restore the Marked 'O's**:
   - Restore the marked 'O's back to 'O' if they were temporarily marked.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(𝑚×𝑛)***, where `𝑚` is the number of rows and 𝑛n is the number of columns in the board. This is a straightforward iteration through all cells of the board.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(𝑚×𝑛)***, due to the recursion stack space.
# Code
```typescript
function solve(board: string[][]): void {
    const m = board.length;
    const n = board[0].length;

    if (m === 0 || n === 0) {
        return;
    }

    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];

    const dfs = (i: number, j: number) => {
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] !== 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[i][j] = 'T'; // Temporarily mark as 'T'
        for (const [di, dj] of directions) {
            dfs(i + di, j + dj);
        }
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (board[i][0] === 'O') {
            dfs(i, 0);
        }
        if (board[i][n - 1] === 'O') {
            dfs(i, n - 1);
        }
    }

    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (board[0][j] === 'O') {
            dfs(0, j);
        }
        if (board[m - 1][j] === 'O') {
            dfs(m - 1, j);
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'O') {
                board[i][j] = 'X';
            } else if (board[i][j] === 'T') {
                board[i][j] = 'O';
            }
        }
    }
};

```

### Explanation
1. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function marks the current cell as 'T' (temporary) and recursively marks all connected 'O's.
2. **Marking Step**: We traverse the border of the board and apply the `dfs` function to any 'O' found, marking all connected 'O's.
3. **Flipping and Restoring**: We then iterate through the board, flipping any remaining 'O's to 'X' and restoring the 'T's back to 'O'.
