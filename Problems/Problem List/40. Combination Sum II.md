[40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)

# Intuition
To find all unique combinations where each candidate number can be used at most once and the combination sums to a given target, we can use a backtracking approach. This method explores all possible combinations while ensuring no duplicates by skipping over duplicates in the sorted list of candidates.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Candidates**: Start by sorting the candidates array to handle duplicates easily and to facilitate the skipping of duplicate elements.
2. **Recursive Backtracking**:
   - **Base Case**: If the current sum equals the target, add the current combination to the result list.
   - **Recursive Case**: Iterate through the candidates starting from the current index. For each candidate:
     - Skip duplicates by checking if the current candidate is the same as the previous candidate.
     - If adding the current candidate exceeds the target, break early due to the sorted order.
     - Include the candidate in the current combination and recursively call the function with the updated sum and the next index.
     - Backtrack by removing the last added candidate to explore other potential combinations.

# Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Sort the candidates array and initialize the result list.
2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Start with an empty combination and an initial sum of 0.
   - For each candidate starting from the current index:
     - Skip the candidate if it is the same as the previous one to avoid duplicates.
     - Add the candidate to the current combination and update the sum.
     - Recursively call the function with the new sum and the next index.
     - Backtrack by removing the last added candidate to explore other combinations.
3. **Collect Results**: All valid combinations are collected in the result list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is ***O(2ⁿ)*** in the worst case, where n is the number of candidates. This is because each element can either be included or excluded in the combination.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(target)*** due to the depth of the recursion stack, as the depth of the recursion is determined by the target divided by the smallest candidate.

# Code
```typescript
function combinationSum2(candidates: number[], target: number): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    candidates.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    function backtrack(start: number, sum: number, combination: number[]) {
        if (sum === target) {
            result.push([...combination]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (i > start && candidates[i] === candidates[i - 1]) continue; 
            if (sum + candidates[i] > target) break; 
            combination.push(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, sum + candidates[i], combination);
            combination.pop();
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, 0, []);

    return result;
};

```
