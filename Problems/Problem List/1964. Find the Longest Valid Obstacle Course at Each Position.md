[1964. Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-valid-obstacle-course-at-each-position/)

# Intuition and Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming and Binary Search**:
   - The problem requires us to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) at each position, where each subsequence must end at that position and can include equal height obstacles.
   - To efficiently find the LIS length at each position, we can maintain a DP array and use binary search to find the appropriate position to update.

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize an empty list `dp` to store the minimum end elements of increasing subsequences of different lengths.
   - Iterate through each obstacle:
     - Use binary search to find the position where the current obstacle can fit in the `dp` list. This position corresponds to the length of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed.
     - If the position is equal to the length of the `dp` list, it means the obstacle can extend the current longest subsequence. Append the obstacle to `dp`.
     - Otherwise, update the `dp` list at the found position with the current obstacle to maintain the smallest possible end element for increasing subsequences of that length.
     - Store the length of the longest subsequence ending at the current position.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The binary search operation takes *O(log n)* for each element.
   - Since we iterate through all elements, the total time complexity is ***O(n log n)***.

4. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** due to the storage of the `dp` list and the result array.

# Code
```typescript
function longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(obstacles: number[]): number[] {
    const n = obstacles.length;
    const dp: number[] = [];
    const result: number[] = new Array(n);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const height = obstacles[i];
        let left = 0;
        let right = dp.length;

        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (dp[mid] <= height) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        if (left === dp.length) {
            dp.push(height);
        } else {
            dp[left] = height;
        }

        result[i] = left + 1;
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is an empty array that will store the smallest possible end element of increasing subsequences of different lengths.
   - `result` is initialized to store the lengths of the LIS ending at each position.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each obstacle, the binary search finds the position in the `dp` array where the obstacle can fit. This position is then used to update the `dp` array.

3. **Update `dp` Array**:
   - If the position found by binary search is equal to the length of the `dp` array, it means we are extending the longest subsequence.
   - Otherwise, we update the `dp` array at the found position to ensure that the end element of the subsequence of that length is the smallest possible.

4. **Result Update**:
   - The length of the longest subsequence ending at each position is stored in the `result` array.
