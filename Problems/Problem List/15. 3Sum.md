# Intuition
To find all unique triplets in the array `nums` such that the sum of the triplet is zero, we can leverage the two-pointer technique along with sorting the array. This will allow us to avoid duplicates and efficiently find valid triplets.

# Approach
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the array `nums`. Sorting helps in skipping duplicates and in using the two-pointer technique.
2. **Iterate and Fix:** Iterate through the array. For each element `nums[i]`, fix it as the first element of the triplet.
3. **Two-pointer Technique:** Use two pointers, `left` starting just after `i`, and `right` at the end of the array.
   - Calculate the sum `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.
   - If the sum is zero, it's a valid triplet. Add it to the result list.
   - If the sum is less than zero, increment `left` to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than zero, decrement `right` to decrease the sum.
4. **Skip Duplicates:** While iterating and using the two-pointer technique, skip duplicates of `nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]` to ensure unique triplets.
5. **Return Result:** Return the list of unique triplets found.

# Explanation
- Sorting the array first allows us to use the two-pointer technique, which is efficient with a complexity of O(n) for finding pairs that sum to a target.
- By iterating through the array and fixing one element as part of the triplet, we can reduce the problem to finding two numbers that sum up to the negation of the fixed number.
- The two-pointer approach ensures that we efficiently find all such pairs while avoiding duplicates by skipping over repeated numbers.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(nÂ²)***
  - Sorting the array takes O(n log n) time, and finding pairs with two pointers takes O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Space complexity: ***O(log n)***
  - The space complexity is primarily due to sorting.

# Code
```TypeScript
function threeSum(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const n = nums.length;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (let i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
        // Skip duplicates of nums[i]
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] === nums[i - 1]) continue;

        let left = i + 1, right = n - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            const sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
            if (sum === 0) {
                result.push([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]);
                // Skip duplicates of nums[left]
                while (left < right && nums[left] === nums[left + 1]) left++;
                // Skip duplicates of nums[right]
                while (left < right && nums[right] === nums[right - 1]) right--;
                left++;
                right--;
            } else if (sum < 0) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};
