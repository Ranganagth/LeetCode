[119. Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/)

# Intuition
To find the rowIndexth row of Pascal's triangle, we can use the properties of Pascal's triangle:
1. The first and last element of each row is always `1`.
2. Each element in the row (except the first and last) is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.

Given the constraints, we need to find an approach that uses only O(rowIndex) extra space.

# Approach
1. Start with an initial row, `row`, initialized to `[1]`.
2. Iterate from `1` to `rowIndex`:
   - Initialize a new array `newRow` with the first element set to `1`.
   - Calculate each element between the first and last elements of `newRow` as the sum of the corresponding elements from `row`.
   - Set the last element of `newRow` to `1`.
   - Update `row` to `newRow`.
3. After completing the iteration, `row` will contain the rowIndexth row of Pascal's triangle.

This approach ensures that we only use O(rowIndex) extra space by updating the same array `row` in place.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(rowIndexÂ²)*** since we compute each row up to rowIndex and each row has up to rowIndex elements.
- Space complexity: ***O(rowIndex)*** since we only store the current row being generated.

# Code
```typescript
function getRow(rowIndex: number): number[] {
    let row: number[] = [1];
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
        let newRow: number[] = [1];
        
        for (let j = 1; j < i; j++) {
            newRow.push(row[j - 1] + row[j]);
        }
        
        newRow.push(1);
        row = newRow;
    }
    
    return row;
};

```
