[24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

# Intuition
To swap every two adjacent nodes in a linked list, we can use a straightforward iterative approach. We'll use a dummy node to handle the edge case of swapping the first two nodes, and then iterate through the list, swapping each pair of adjacent nodes. 

# Approach
1. **Dummy Node Setup:** Initialize a `dummy` node and set its `next` pointer to the `head` of the linked list. This dummy node helps in cases where the head of the list itself needs to be swapped.
2. **Iterative Swap:** Use a loop to traverse the linked list. In each iteration:
   - Identify the two nodes to be swapped, `firstNode` and `secondNode`.
   - Adjust the pointers:
     - `prev.next` should point to `secondNode`.
     - `firstNode.next` should point to `secondNode.next`.
     - `secondNode.next` should point to `firstNode`.
   - Move the `prev` pointer to `firstNode` for the next pair.
   - Move the `head` pointer to `firstNode.next` for the next iteration.
3. **Return the Result:** Finally, return `dummy.next` which will be the new head of the modified linked list.

# Explanation
- We use a `dummy` node to handle the case when we need to swap the first two nodes. This dummy node helps to simplify the logic and ensures that we can always start swapping from the beginning.
- Inside the loop, we perform the swaps using three main operations:
  - Adjusting the `prev.next` pointer to point to the `secondNode`.
  - Swapping the `firstNode` and `secondNode` by adjusting their `next` pointers.
- After completing the loop, the `dummy.next` points to the new head of the swapped linked list.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We process each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)***, no extra space is used apart from a few pointers.

# Code
```typescript
function swapPairs(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;
    
    let dummy = new ListNode();
    dummy.next = head;
    let prev = dummy;
    
    while (head && head.next) {
        const firstNode = head;
        const secondNode = head.next;
        
        prev.next = secondNode;
        firstNode.next = secondNode.next;
        secondNode.next = firstNode;
        
        prev = firstNode;
        head = firstNode.next;
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
};
