[171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/)

To solve the problem of converting an Excel column title back to its corresponding column number, we need to reverse the logic we used when converting a column number to its title. Essentially, we need to treat the string as a representation of a number in base-26.

# Intuition and Approach

1. **Base-26 Interpretation**: The string is a representation of a number in base-26 where 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., and 'Z' to 26.
2. **Calculate Value**: Iterate through each character of the string from left to right, calculating its positional value by multiplying it by *26ᵏ* where *k* is its position from the right (0-based index).

### Steps

1. Initialize a variable to store the resulting number.
2. Iterate through each character of the string:
   - Convert the character to its corresponding numerical value (e.g., 'A' -> 1, 'B' -> 2).
   - Use this value to update the result by considering its position in the string.
3. Return the resulting number.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the input string, since we process each character once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a few additional variables.

# Code
```typescript
function titleToNumber(columnTitle: string): number {
    let result = 0;
    const length = columnTitle.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        const charValue = columnTitle.charCodeAt(i) - 'A'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
        result = result * 26 + charValue;
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We start with `result` set to 0.
2. **Iterate Through Characters**: For each character in `columnTitle`:
   - **Convert Character to Number**: Compute the numerical value of the character by using `charCodeAt` to get its ASCII value, then subtract the ASCII value of 'A' and add 1 (to convert 'A' to 1, 'B' to 2, etc.).
   - **Update Result**: Update the `result` by multiplying the current `result` by 26 and adding the character's numerical value.
3. **Return Result**: After processing all characters, `result` contains the desired column number.
