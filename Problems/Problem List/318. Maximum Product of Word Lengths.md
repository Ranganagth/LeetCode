[318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/)

### Problem Overview

You are given an array of lowercase words. You must return the **maximum product** of the lengths of two words **without common letters**.

---

# Intuition

To determine whether two words share common letters, a naive approach would compare every character of both words — this is slow. Instead, we can use **bitmasking**:
* Every word can be represented by a **26-bit integer**.
* Each bit represents whether a character `a` to `z` is present in the word.
* Two words **do not share common letters** if their bitmasks' **AND operation equals 0**.

---

# Approach

1. **Preprocess all words**:
   * For each word, calculate:
     * Its bitmask.
     * Its length.
2. **Check every pair** of words:
   * If their bitmasks have no common bits (`bitmask1 & bitmask2 == 0`), update the maximum product.
3. Return the maximum product found.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Preprocessing: `O(n * l)` where `l` is the average word length (to compute bitmask).
  * Pair checking: $O(n^2)$ for comparing all pairs.
  * Overall: $O(n^2 + n * l)$ which is acceptable for `n <= 1000`.

* **Space Complexity**:
  * O(n) for storing bitmasks and lengths.

# Code

```ts
function maxProduct(words: string[]): number {
    const n = words.length;
    const masks: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const lengths: number[] = new Array(n);

    // Step 1: Compute bitmask and length for each word
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let mask = 0;
        for (const char of words[i]) {
            mask |= 1 << (char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0));
        }
        masks[i] = mask;
        lengths[i] = words[i].length;
    }

    // Step 2: Compare each pair
    let maxProduct = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if ((masks[i] & masks[j]) === 0) {
                maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, lengths[i] * lengths[j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxProduct;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1

```ts
Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
```

* "abcw" → mask covers a, b, c, w
* "xtfn" → mask covers x, t, f, n
* `mask("abcw") & mask("xtfn") == 0` → no overlap
* Lengths: 4 * 4 = 16 → max product

Output: `16`

#### Example 2

```ts
Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
```

* Best pair: "ab" and "cd" → length 2 * 2 = 4

Output: `4`

#### Example 3

```ts
Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
```

* All words share letter "a" → overlap in bitmask
* No valid pair

Output: `0`

### **Summary**

This solution leverages bit manipulation for efficient character set comparison and reduces unnecessary string operations. The result is a performant and scalable solution, well-suited for input sizes up to 1000 words.
