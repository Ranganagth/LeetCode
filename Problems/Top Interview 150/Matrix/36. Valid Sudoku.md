[36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

# Intuition
To determine if the Sudoku board is valid, we need to check:
1. Each row must contain digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the nine 3x3 sub-boxes must contain digits 1-9 without repetition.

# Approach
We will use a set to keep track of seen digits for each row, column, and sub-box. We iterate through each cell in the board:
- For each cell, check its value.
- Use three sets to keep track of seen digits for the current row, current column, and current sub-box.
- If we encounter a digit that has already been seen in the respective set, the board is invalid.

# Explanation
Given the constraints and rules of Sudoku, our approach involves:
1. Iterating through each cell in the 9x9 board.
2. Using sets to keep track of seen digits in each row, column, and sub-box.
3. Checking each digit against these sets and updating them accordingly.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: **O(1)** (since the board is always 9x9)
- Space complexity: **O(1)** (since the sets are fixed size, always at most 9 elements)

# Code
```typescript
function isValidSudoku(board: string[][]): boolean {
    const seenRows = new Array(9).fill(0).map(() => new Set<string>());
    const seenCols = new Array(9).fill(0).map(() => new Set<string>());
    const seenSubBoxes = new Array(9).fill(0).map(() => new Set<string>());
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
            const num = board[i][j];
            if (num !== '.') {
                if (seenRows[i].has(num)) return false;
                seenRows[i].add(num);
                
                if (seenCols[j].has(num)) return false;
                seenCols[j].add(num);
                
                const subBoxIndex = Math.floor(i / 3) * 3 + Math.floor(j / 3);
                if (seenSubBoxes[subBoxIndex].has(num)) return false;
                seenSubBoxes[subBoxIndex].add(num);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};

```
