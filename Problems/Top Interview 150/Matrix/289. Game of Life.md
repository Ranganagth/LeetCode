[289. Game of Life](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/)

# Intuition
The Game of Life is a classic problem that involves updating the state of a grid based on predefined rules. The main challenge is to apply the rules simultaneously to every cell without prematurely updating any cell, which could affect other updates.

# Approach
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Traverse through each cell in the grid and count its live neighbors.
2. Apply the rules of the game to determine the next state of each cell.
3. Use a temporary state to ensure simultaneous updates without interference.
4. Update the original grid with the new states.

To implement the in-place update while avoiding interference, we can use temporary markers:
- Use `2` to indicate a cell that was alive but will die.
- Use `-1` to indicate a cell that was dead but will become alive.

After applying the rules using these markers, we convert the markers to their final states.

# Explanation
1. **Counting Live Neighbors**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors by checking the eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
2. **Applying Rules**: Based on the count of live neighbors, update the cell's state using temporary markers:
   - If a live cell has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, mark it to die (use `2`).
   - If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, mark it to become alive (use `-1`).
3. **Final Update**: Traverse the grid again and convert temporary markers to final states (`2` to `0` and `-1` to `1`).

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We traverse the entire grid twice.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***, since we modify the grid in place without using additional space.

# Code
```typescript
function gameOfLife(board: number[][]): void {
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;
    
    const directions = [
        [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
        [0, -1],         [0, 1],
        [1, -1], [1, 0], [1, 1]
    ];
    
    const isLive = (r: number, c: number) => {
        return r >= 0 && r < rows && c >= 0 && c < cols && (board[r][c] === 1 || board[r][c] === 2);
    };
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            let liveNeighbors = 0;
            for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
                const nr = r + dr;
                const nc = c + dc;
                if (isLive(nr, nc)) liveNeighbors++;
            }
            if (board[r][c] === 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
                board[r][c] = 2;
            } else if (board[r][c] === 0 && liveNeighbors === 3) {
                board[r][c] = -1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (board[r][c] === 2) {
                board[r][c] = 0;
            } else if (board[r][c] === -1) {
                board[r][c] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
