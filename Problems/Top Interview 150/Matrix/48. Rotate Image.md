[48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)

# Intuition

To rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise, we can perform two steps:
1. Transpose the matrix.
2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.

# Approach

1. Transpose the matrix in-place:
   - Iterate through the matrix and swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i].
2. Reverse each row of the transposed matrix:
   - Iterate through the matrix and reverse each row.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(nÂ²)***, where n is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
function rotate(matrix: number[][]): void {
    const n = matrix.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            [matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i]] = [matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]];
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        matrix[i].reverse();
    }
};

```
