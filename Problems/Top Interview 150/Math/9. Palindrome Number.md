[9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

# Intuition
A number is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. Negative numbers and numbers ending in zero (but not zero itself) cannot be palindromes. 

# Approach
1. Handle edge cases: 
   - If `x` is negative, return `false`.
   - If `x` ends in zero but is not zero, return `false`.
2. Reverse the digits of the number until the reversed number is at least half of the original number.
3. Compare the reversed half with the remaining half of the original number to determine if they are the same.

# Explanation
1. If `x` is negative or if `x` ends in zero (but is not zero), it cannot be a palindrome.
2. Initialize `reversed` as `0`. This will store the reversed digits of `x`.
3. While the reversed part is less than the remaining part of `x`:
   - Extract the last digit of `x` using `x % 10` and append it to `reversed`.
   - Remove the last digit from `x` by performing integer division by `10`.
4. After the loop, `reversed` will be the reverse of the digits of `x` processed so far. If `x` is equal to `reversed` or `x` is equal to `Math.floor(reversed / 10)`, then `x` is a palindrome.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(log10(x))***
  - The number of digits in `x` determines the number of iterations, which is `log10(x)`.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function isPalindrome(x: number): boolean {
    if (x < 0 || (x % 10 === 0 && x !== 0)) {
        return false;
    }

    let reversed = 0;
    while (x > reversed) {
        reversed = reversed * 10 + (x % 10);
        x = Math.floor(x / 10);
    }

    return x === reversed || x === Math.floor(reversed / 10);
};
