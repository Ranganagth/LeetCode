[74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

# Intuition
The given matrix can be thought of as a single sorted list since each row is sorted and the first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. To search for a target in this matrix efficiently, we can use a binary search algorithm.

# Approach
1. Treat the matrix as a single sorted array of size \( m \times n \).
2. Use binary search to find the target:
   - Convert the 1D index to 2D indices to access elements in the matrix.
   - Calculate the middle index and map it to the matrix's row and column.
   - Compare the middle element with the target:
     - If equal, return true.
     - If the middle element is less than the target, adjust the search range to the right half.
     - If the middle element is greater than the target, adjust the search range to the left half.
3. If the target is not found after the binary search, return false.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(log(m x n))***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we are performing binary search on a conceptual array of size `m x n`.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)*** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function searchMatrix(matrix: number[][], target: number): boolean {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    
    let left = 0;
    let right = m * n - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const midValue = matrix[Math.floor(mid / n)][mid % n];
        
        if (midValue === target) {
            return true;
        } else if (midValue < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};
```
