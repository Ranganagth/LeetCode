[162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

# Intuition

To find a peak element in an array efficiently, we can utilize a binary search approach due to the log(n) time complexity requirement. The key insight is that if an element at mid is greater than its right neighbor, there must be a peak on the left side (including the mid element). Conversely, if the mid element is smaller than its right neighbor, there must be a peak on the right side. This property allows us to eliminate half of the search space at each step.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Pointers**: Start with two pointers, `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Calculate the middle index, `mid`.
   - Compare the element at `mid` with its right neighbor.
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, move the `right` pointer to `mid` because a peak must exist on the left side or at `mid`.
   - Otherwise, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` because a peak must exist on the right side.
3. **Termination**: When `left` equals `right`, `left` (or `right`) will be pointing to a peak element.
4. **Return the Index**: Return the index where the peak element is found.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, as we halve the search space with each step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use only a few extra variables.

# Code
```typescript
function findPeakElement(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Initialization**: `left` and `right` pointers are set to the start and end of the array.
- **Binary Search Loop**: The loop runs until `left` is equal to `right`.
  - **Calculate `mid`**: Compute the middle index.
  - **Comparison and Pointer Adjustment**:
    - If the element at `mid` is greater than the element at `mid + 1`, a peak must be on the left side, so adjust `right` to `mid`.
    - Otherwise, adjust `left` to `mid + 1` as a peak must be on the right side.
- **Return**: When the loop exits, `left` points to a peak element's index.
