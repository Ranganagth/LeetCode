[56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

# Intuition

We can solve this problem by sorting the intervals based on the start time and then merging overlapping intervals.

# Approach

1. Sort the intervals based on the start time.
2. Initialize an empty array `merged` to store the merged intervals.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:
   - If `merged` is empty or if the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `merged`, add the current interval to `merged`.
   - If the current interval overlaps with the last interval in `merged`, merge them.
4. Return `merged`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n log n)***, where n is the number of intervals.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code

```typescript
function merge(intervals: number[][]): number[][] {
    if (intervals.length <= 1) return intervals;
    
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    const merged: number[][] = [intervals[0]];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        const last = merged[merged.length - 1];
        const current = intervals[i];
        
        if (current[0] <= last[1]) {
            last[1] = Math.max(last[1], current[1]);
        } else {
            merged.push(current);
        }
    }
    
    return merged;
};
