[120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

# Intuition:
You are given a triangle array where each number represents the value of a node. You start from the top of the triangle and move to an adjacent number on the row below until you reach the bottom. You need to find the path that has the minimum sum.

# Approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We will use a 1D array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach the current element in row `i` and column `j` of the triangle.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing the `dp` array with the elements of the last row of the triangle. This serves as our starting point since there are no further rows below it.

3. **Bottom-Up Calculation**:
   - Iterate from the second last row to the first row of the triangle.
   - For each element in the current row, update `dp[j]` to be the minimum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j+1]` (which are the two possible adjacent elements in the next row) plus the current element.

4. **Result**:
   - After processing all rows, `dp[0]` will contain the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. This is because we iterate through each element of the triangle and update the `dp` array accordingly.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of rows in the triangle. We use an extra array `dp` of size n.

# Code
```typescript
function minimumTotal(triangle: number[][]): number {
    const n = triangle.length;
    const dp = triangle[n - 1];
    
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            dp[j] = triangle[i][j] + Math.min(dp[j], dp[j + 1]);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start with initializing `dp` with the last row of the triangle.
- We then iterate from the second last row to the first row of the triangle.
- For each element in the current row, we update `dp[j]` to be the minimum of `dp[j]` and `dp[j+1]` plus the current element in the triangle.
- Finally, `dp[0]` will contain the minimum path sum from the top to the bottom of the triangle.
