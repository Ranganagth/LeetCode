[5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

# Intuition
To find the longest palindromic substring, we can utilize the concept of expanding around each character and pair of characters (centers) in the string. This approach allows us to check for palindromes by examining characters symmetrically around a center.

# Approach
1. Iterate through each character in the string and treat it as a potential center of a palindrome.
2. For each character, expand around it by checking if the characters on both sides are equal.
3. Keep track of the longest palindrome found during these expansions.
4. Consider both single-character centers and pairs of characters as centers (for even-length palindromes).
5. Return the substring that corresponds to the longest palindromic substring found.

# Explanation
- The `longestPalindrome` function initializes `start` and `end` pointers to keep track of the indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.
- It iterates through each character in the string and uses the `expandAroundCenter` function to expand around the current character(s) to find palindromes.
- The `expandAroundCenter` function expands outwards from the given `left` and `right` indices as long as the characters at these indices are equal, thus identifying the length of the palindrome.
- By comparing the length of the palindromes found with the current longest palindrome, the `longestPalindrome` function updates `start` and `end` when a longer palindrome is found.
- Finally, it returns the substring from `start` to `end + 1`, which is the longest palindromic substring.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n^2)***
  - Each expansion takes linear time and there are potentially n centers (each character and each pair of characters), resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses constant extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function longestPalindrome(s: string): string {
    if (s.length < 2) return s;

    let start = 0;
    let end = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i); 
        const len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1); 
        const len = Math.max(len1, len2);

        if (len > end - start) {
            start = i - Math.floor((len - 1) / 2);
            end = i + Math.floor(len / 2);
        }
    }

    return s.substring(start, end + 1);
}

function expandAroundCenter(s: string, left: number, right: number): number {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return right - left - 1;
};
