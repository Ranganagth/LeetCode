[188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to determine the best way to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit with at most \( k \) transactions. We can't engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, meaning we must sell before we can buy again.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Tables**:
   - We'll use two DP tables, `dp[i][j]` to represent the maximum profit up to the \( i \)-th day with at most \( j \) transactions.
   - Another table `maxDiff` to keep track of the maximum difference for each transaction up to the current day.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - When there are 0 transactions, the profit is always 0: `dp[i][0] = 0` for all \( i \).
   - When there are 0 days, the profit is always 0: `dp[0][j] = 0` for all \( j \).

3. **State Transition**:
   - For each day \( i \) and each transaction \( j \):
     - Either we do not trade on day \( i \), and the profit is the same as the previous day: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`.
     - Or we sell on day \( i \), having bought on a previous day \( m \): `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], prices[i] + maxDiff[j])`.
   - `maxDiff[j]` is updated as `max(maxDiff[j], dp[i-1][j-1] - prices[i])`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n × k)***, where `n` is the number of days and `k` is the number of transactions.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n × k)*** due to the DP table. This can be reduced to `O(k)` with space optimization techniques.

# Code
```typescript
function maxProfit(k: number, prices: number[]): number {
    const n = prices.length;
    if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;

    if (k >= n / 2) {
        let maxProfit = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }

    const dp = Array.from({ length: k + 1 }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    for (let j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
        let maxDiff = -prices[0];
        for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[j][i] = Math.max(dp[j][i - 1], prices[i] + maxDiff);
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[j - 1][i] - prices[i]);
        }
    }
    return dp[k][n - 1];
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Edge Cases**: If there are no prices or no transactions allowed, the profit is zero.
2. **High \( k \)**: If \( k \) is larger than half the number of days, we can perform as many transactions as possible by summing up all positive differences.
3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Initialize `dp` table where `dp[j][i]` represents the maximum profit up to day \( i \) with at most \( j \) transactions.
   - Use `maxDiff` to store the maximum value of `dp[j-1][m] - prices[m]` for optimization.
   - Iterate through days and transactions to fill the `dp` table and return the maximum profit for \( k \) transactions on the last day.
