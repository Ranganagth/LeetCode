[123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/)

# Intuition

Given the constraint that we can complete at most two transactions, the problem can be divided into two parts:
1. **First transaction**: Find the maximum profit we can achieve from the first buy and sell.
2. **Second transaction**: Find the maximum profit from a second buy and sell, with the constraint that the second transaction must happen after the first one.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use four variables to keep track of the minimum price and the maximum profit for the first and second transactions.
     - `buy1`: Minimum price to buy stock 1.
     - `profit1`: Maximum profit after the first sell.
     - `buy2`: Minimum price to buy stock 2 after selling stock 1.
     - `profit2`: Maximum profit after the second sell.

2. **Iterate Through the Prices**:
   - Update `buy1` to be the minimum of the current price and `buy1`.
   - Update `profit1` to be the maximum of the current profit and the current price minus `buy1`.
   - Update `buy2` to be the minimum of the current price and `buy2` minus `profit1` (this ensures we're buying stock 2 after selling stock 1).
   - Update `profit2` to be the maximum of the current profit and the current price minus `buy2`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The maximum profit after two transactions will be stored in `profit2`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the prices array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, using constant space for variables.

# Code
```typescript
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
    let buy1 = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let profit1 = 0;
    let buy2 = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let profit2 = 0;
    
    for (let price of prices) {
        buy1 = Math.min(buy1, price);
        profit1 = Math.max(profit1, price - buy1);
        buy2 = Math.min(buy2, price - profit1);
        profit2 = Math.max(profit2, price - buy2);
    }
    
    return profit2;
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Start with `buy1` and `buy2` initialized to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, representing an impossible high price. `profit1` and `profit2` are initialized to 0.
- **Loop through prices**: Update `buy1`, `profit1`, `buy2`, and `profit2` based on the current price. This ensures we get the maximum profit after both transactions.
- **Return**: The value in `profit2` will be the maximum profit we can achieve with at most two transactions.
