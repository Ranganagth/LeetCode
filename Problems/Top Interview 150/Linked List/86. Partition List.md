[86. Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/)

# Intuition
- We'll create two separate linked lists, one for nodes with values less than x and the other for nodes with values greater than or equal to x.
- Traverse the original linked list, adding nodes to the appropriate partition.
- Finally, merge the two partitions to obtain the final linked list.

# Approach
1. We'll initialize four pointers:
   - `beforeStart` and `beforeEnd` for nodes less than x.
   - `afterStart` and `afterEnd` for nodes greater than or equal to x.
2. Traverse the original list:
   - If a node's value is less than x, add it to the `before` partition.
   - If a node's value is greater than or equal to x, add it to the `after` partition.
3. After traversing, we'll connect the `beforeEnd` to the `afterStart` to merge the two partitions.
4. Finally, we'll return the head of the merged list.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list only once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function partition(head: ListNode | null, x: number): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }
    
    let beforeStart: ListNode | null = null;
    let beforeEnd: ListNode | null = null;
    let afterStart: ListNode | null = null;
    let afterEnd: ListNode | null = null;
    
    while (head) {
        const nextNode: ListNode | null = head.next;
        head.next = null;
        
        if (head.val < x) {
            if (!beforeStart) {
                beforeStart = head;
                beforeEnd = beforeStart;
            } else {
                beforeEnd!.next = head;
                beforeEnd = beforeEnd!.next;
            }
        } else {
            if (!afterStart) {
                afterStart = head;
                afterEnd = afterStart;
            } else {
                afterEnd!.next = head;
                afterEnd = afterEnd!.next;
            }
        }
        
        head = nextNode;
    }
    
    if (beforeEnd) {
        beforeEnd.next = afterStart;
        return beforeStart;
    } else {
        return afterStart;
    }
};

```

### Explanation
1. We initialize four pointers: `beforeStart`, `beforeEnd`, `afterStart`, and `afterEnd` to manage the two partitions.
2. We traverse the original list and add nodes to the appropriate partition based on their values compared to x.
3. After traversing, we connect the end of the `before` partition to the start of the `after` partition.
4. Finally, we return the head of the merged list.
