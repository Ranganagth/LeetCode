[25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

# Intuition
To reverse nodes in groups of k in a linked list, we can use a recursive approach combined with a helper function to reverse a segment of k nodes at a time.

# Approach
1. **Helper Function to Reverse K Nodes:** Define a helper function `reverseKNodes` that takes two parameters `start` and `end`, representing the start and end nodes of the segment of k nodes to be reversed. Within this function:
   - Initialize `prev` as null and `curr` as `start`.
   - Iterate through the segment of k nodes:
     - Store `curr.next` in a variable `next`.
     - Reverse the pointer of `curr.next` to `prev`.
     - Update `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next`.
   - Return the `prev` node as the new head of the reversed segment.
2. **Reverse K Nodes in Groups:** In the main function `reverseKGroup`, initialize variables `count` and `curr`. Iterate through the linked list while `curr` is not null and `count` is less than `k`.
3. If the count is less than k, it means we have less than k nodes remaining, so we return the current head as it is.
4. If we have k or more nodes, call the `reverseKNodes` function with the current head and the node `k` positions ahead of the current head. This reverses the segment of k nodes.
5. Connect the tail of the reversed segment to the result of recursively reversing the remaining nodes by calling `reverseKGroup` with the node `k` positions ahead of the current head.
6. Return the new head of the reversed linked list.

# Explanation
- We use a helper function `reverseKNodes` to reverse a segment of k nodes at a time.
- In the main function `reverseKGroup`, we iterate through the linked list, reversing segments of k nodes until we reach the end of the list or have less than k nodes remaining.
- For each segment of k nodes, we reverse them using the `reverseKNodes` function and connect the reversed segment to the result of reversing the remaining nodes recursively.
- Finally, we return the new head of the reversed linked list.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We process each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)***, as we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input.

# Code
```typescript
function reverseKGroup(head: ListNode | null, k: number): ListNode | null {
    const reverseKNodes = (start: ListNode, end: ListNode): ListNode => {
        let prev = null;
        let curr = start;
        while (curr !== end) {
            const next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next!;
        }
        return prev!;
    };

    let count = 0;
    let curr: ListNode | null = head;
    while (curr && count < k) {
        curr = curr.next;
        count++;
    }

    if (count < k) {
        return head;
    }

    const reversedHead = reverseKNodes(head!, curr!);

    head!.next = reverseKGroup(curr, k);

    return reversedHead;
};
