[92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

# Intuition
To reverse the nodes of a singly linked list from position `left` to `right`, we can follow these steps:
1. Traverse the list until we reach the node at position `left - 1`.
2. Record the node at position `left - 1` as `prev`, and the node at position `left` as `current`.
3. Reverse the nodes from position `left` to `right` while keeping track of the next node and updating the pointers accordingly.
4. Connect the reversed segment with the rest of the list.

# Approach
1. Initialize a dummy node `dummy` to facilitate handling edge cases and simplify the code.
2. Traverse the list until we reach the node at position `left - 1`, keeping track of the `prev` node.
3. Record the node at position `left` as `current`.
4. Reverse the nodes from position `left` to `right` using three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next`.
5. Connect the reversed segment with the rest of the list.
6. Return the head of the modified list.

# Complexity
Since we traverse the list only once, 
- **Time Complexity** of this approach is ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity** is ***O(1)*** because we use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function reverseBetween(head: ListNode | null, left: number, right: number): ListNode | null {
    const dummy: ListNode = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let prev: ListNode = dummy;

    for (let i = 0; i < left - 1; i++) {
        prev = prev.next!;
    }

    let current: ListNode | null = prev.next;
    for (let i = 0; i < right - left; i++) {
        const nextNode = current!.next;
        current!.next = nextNode!.next;
        nextNode!.next = prev.next;
        prev.next = nextNode;
    }

    return dummy.next;
};

```
