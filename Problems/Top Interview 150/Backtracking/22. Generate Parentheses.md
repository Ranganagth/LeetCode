[22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

# Intuition
To generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses, we can use a recursive approach known as backtracking. This method will help us efficiently generate all valid combinations by exploring all possible paths.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking Function:** Define a recursive function `backtrack` that builds the valid combinations of parentheses.
   - The function will take three parameters:
     - `s`: The current string being built.
     - `openCount`: The count of open parentheses '('.
     - `closeCount`: The count of close parentheses ')'.
2. **Base Case:** If the length of the current string `s` is equal to `2 * n`, it means we have formed a valid combination of `n` pairs of parentheses. Add this string to the result.
3. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If `openCount` is less than `n`, recursively call `backtrack` with `s + '('`, `openCount + 1`, and `closeCount`.
   - If `closeCount` is less than `openCount`, recursively call `backtrack` with `s + ')'`, `openCount`, and `closeCount + 1`.
4. **Initialization:** Start the recursion with an empty string `s`, `0` as the initial `openCount`, and `0` as the initial `closeCount`.
5. **Return Result:** After all recursive calls, return the result array containing all valid combinations of parentheses.

# Explanation
- The recursive function `backtrack` is used to generate all possible valid combinations of parentheses.
- We maintain counts of open and close parentheses to ensure that we generate only valid parentheses combinations.
- The base case ensures that once we have formed a valid combination of `n` pairs of parentheses, we add it to the result array.
- Recursive cases explore all possible combinations by adding '(' or ')' as long as they are valid according to the rules of parentheses.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(4ⁿ / sqrt(n))***. Each valid sequence has at most `2 * n` characters, and in each sequence, we do a constant amount of work determining if it is valid. The number of valid sequences of `n` pairs of parentheses is the nth Catalan number, which is bounded asymptotically by ***4ⁿ / sqrt(n)***.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(4ⁿ / sqrt(n))***. This is the same as the time complexity because of the space needed for the output.

# Code
```typescript
function generateParenthesis(n: number): string[] {
    function backtrack(s: string, openCount: number, closeCount: number): void {
        if (s.length === 2 * n) {
            result.push(s);
            return;
        }

        if (openCount < n) {
            backtrack(s + '(', openCount + 1, closeCount);
        }

        if (closeCount < openCount) {
            backtrack(s + ')', openCount, closeCount + 1);
        }
    }

    const result: string[] = [];
    backtrack('', 0, 0);
    return result;
};
