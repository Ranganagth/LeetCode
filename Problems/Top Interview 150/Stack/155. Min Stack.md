[155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

# Intuition

The main challenge is to maintain the minimum element efficiently. Using a secondary stack, we can keep track of the minimum values corresponding to the elements in the main stack.

# Approach

1. **Main Stack**: This stack will store all the elements.
2. **Min Stack**: This stack will store the minimum values. The top of this stack will always be the minimum value for the elements in the main stack.

### Operations

1. **push(val)**:
    - Push the value onto the main stack.
    - If the min stack is empty or the value is less than or equal to the top of the min stack, push the value onto the min stack.
2. **pop()**:
    - Pop the value from the main stack.
    - If the popped value is equal to the top of the min stack, pop the min stack as well.
3. **top()**:
    - Return the top value from the main stack.
4. **getMin()**:
    - Return the top value from the min stack.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***𝑂(1)*** for all operations (push, pop, top, getMin) because all operations on a stack (push, pop, peek) are constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***𝑂(𝑛)*** where 𝑛n is the number of elements in the stack. In the worst case, all elements could be stored in the min stack.

# Code

``` typescript
class MinStack {
    private stack: number[];
    private minStack: number[];

    constructor() {
        this.stack = [];
        this.minStack = [];
    }

    push(val: number): void {
        this.stack.push(val);
        if (this.minStack.length === 0 || val <= this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.push(val);
        }
    }

    pop(): void {
        const val = this.stack.pop();
        if (val === this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1]) {
            this.minStack.pop();
        }
    }

    top(): number {
        return this.stack[this.stack.length - 1];
    }

    getMin(): number {
        return this.minStack[this.minStack.length - 1];
    }
};

```
### Explanation

- **push(val)**: Adds `val` to `stack`. If `minStack` is empty or `val` is less than or equal to the current minimum, `val` is also added to `minStack`.
- **pop()**: Removes the top element from `stack`. If the removed element is the current minimum, it is also removed from `minStack`.
- **top()**: Returns the top element of `stack`.
- **getMin()**: Returns the top element of `minStack`, which is the current minimum.
