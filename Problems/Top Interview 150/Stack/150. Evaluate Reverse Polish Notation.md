[150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)

# Intuition
Using a stack to evaluate RPN expressions is intuitive because it allows us to handle operators as soon as they appear, with immediate access to the operands they need.

# Approach
1. **Stack Initialization**: Create an empty stack to store operands.
2. **Iterate through Tokens**: Loop through each token in the given list.
3. **Handle Operands**: If the token is an operand (number), push it onto the stack.
4. **Handle Operators**: If the token is an operator, pop the required number of operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
5. **Result**: After processing all tokens, the stack will contain one element, which is the result of the expression.

### Explanation
- **Operands**: Push them onto the stack.
- **Operators**: Pop the necessary operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
  - For `+` and `-`, pop two elements, apply the operation, and push the result.
  - For `*` and `/`, ensure integer division is handled correctly (truncating towards zero).

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we process each token exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the stack to store operands.

# Code
```typescript
function evalRPN(tokens: string[]): number {
    const stack: number[] = [];

    for (const token of tokens) {
        if (["+", "-", "*", "/"].includes(token)) {
            const b = stack.pop()!;
            const a = stack.pop()!;
            let result: number;
            switch (token) {
                case "+":
                    result = a + b;
                    break;
                case "-":
                    result = a - b;
                    break;
                case "*":
                    result = a * b;
                    break;
                case "/":
                    result = Math.trunc(a / b);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new Error("Invalid operator");
            }
            stack.push(result);
        } else {
            stack.push(parseInt(token));
        }
    }

    return stack.pop()!;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Stack Initialization**: We use an array `stack` to simulate the stack operations.
2. **Loop through Tokens**: For each token:
   - If it's an operator, pop the last two numbers from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back.
   - If it's a number, parse it and push onto the stack.
3. **Final Result**: The last element remaining in the stack is the result of the RPN expression.
