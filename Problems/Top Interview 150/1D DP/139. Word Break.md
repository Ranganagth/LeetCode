[139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to determine if a given string *s* can be segmented into words from a dictionary *wordDict*. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming.

# Approach
We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem:

1. **Define the DP Array**: 
   - Let `dp[i]` represent whether the substring `s[0...i-1]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.
   - `dp[0]` is true because the empty string is always in the dictionary.

2. **Transition Formula**:
   - To determine `dp[i]`, iterate through all words in the dictionary.
   - For each word, check if the substring ending at index `i-1` (exclusive) matches the word and if `dp[i - word.length]` is true.
   - If both conditions are met, then `dp[i]` can be set to true.

3. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the length of string `s`).
   - Set `dp[0]` to true, as an empty string is always considered as a valid segmentation.

4. **Iterate and Fill DP Table**:
   - Iterate through each index `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each index `i`, iterate through all words in `wordDict` and check the conditions mentioned above to update `dp[i]`.

5. **Result**:
   - After filling the `dp` array, `dp[n]` will be true if the entire string `s` can be segmented into words from `wordDict`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n â‹… m)***, where *n* is the length of string `s` and *m* is the size of `wordDict`. The nested loops iterate through the string and the dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the `dp` array.

This approach efficiently checks if a string can be segmented into words from a dictionary using dynamic programming.

# Code
```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): boolean {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp: boolean[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let word of wordDict) {
            if (word.length <= i && dp[i - word.length] && s.substring(i - word.length, i) === word) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

```
