[198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

# Intuition

The problem of robbing houses such that no two adjacent houses are robbed can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to determine the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to each house and use this information to decide whether to rob a particular house or not.

# Approach

1. **Define State**:
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the `i-th` house.
   - `dp[0]` is simply `nums[0]` because if there's only one house, that's the most you can rob.
   - `dp[1]` is `max(nums[0], nums[1])` because you can only rob one of the first two houses.

2. **State Transition**:
   - For each subsequent house `i`, you have two choices:
     - Do not rob the current house `i`, in which case the maximum amount is the same as `dp[i-1]`.
     - Rob the current house `i`, in which case you add the value of the current house `nums[i]` to `dp[i-2]` (since you cannot rob the previous house).
   - Thus, the state transition formula is:
     ```
     dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
     ```

3. **Result**:
   - The final result will be in `dp[n-1]` where `n` is the number of houses.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of houses. We iterate through the list of houses once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we are using two variables to store the last two states instead of maintaining a full `dp` array.

# Code
```typescript
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
    let prev = 0;
    let curr = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        const temp = Math.max(curr, prev + num);
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }

    return curr;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `prev` and `curr` are initialized to 0. These will represent `dp[i-2]` and `dp[i-1]` respectively during the iteration.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each house in `nums`, we calculate `temp` as the maximum of either:
     - Not robbing the current house (`curr`), or
     - Robbing the current house (`prev + num`).
   - Update `prev` to be `curr` and `curr` to be `temp`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The variable `curr` will contain the maximum amount of money that can be robbed by the end of the iteration.
