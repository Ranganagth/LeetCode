[322. Coin Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the fewest number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.

# Approach

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `amount + 1`, where `dp[i]` is initialized to `Infinity` for all `i` except `dp[0] = 0`.
2. Iterate through the coins:
   - For each coin `coin`, iterate through the amounts from `coin` to `amount`:
     - Update `dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)`.
3. After iterating through all coins and amounts, return `dp[amount]` if it is less than `Infinity`, otherwise return `-1`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n â‹… k)***, where `n` is the number of coins and `k` is the amount.
- Space complexity: ***O(k)***

# Code

```typescript
function coinChange(coins: number[], amount: number): number {
    const dp: number[] = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (const coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
};
