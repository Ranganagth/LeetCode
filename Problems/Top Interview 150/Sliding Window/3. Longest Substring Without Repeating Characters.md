[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. The intuitive approach is to use the sliding window technique to efficiently track the current substring and expand or contract the window as necessary to maintain the constraint of no repeating characters.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the sliding window.
2. Use a `Set` to keep track of characters in the current window.
3. Traverse the string with the `right` pointer:
   - If the character at the `right` pointer is not in the `Set`, add it to the `Set`, expand the window by moving the `right` pointer one step to the right, and update the maximum length.
   - If the character is already in the `Set`, remove the character at the `left` pointer from the `Set`, and contract the window by moving the `left` pointer one step to the right.
4. Continue this process until the `right` pointer has traversed the entire string.
5. The maximum length recorded during this traversal is the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Explanation
- The sliding window technique allows us to dynamically adjust the window size to maintain the condition of no repeating characters.
- By using a `Set`, we can efficiently check for the presence of characters and ensure that the operations of adding and removing characters from the `Set` are performed in constant time.
- The `left` pointer is used to shrink the window from the left side when a duplicate character is found, ensuring that the window always contains unique characters.
- The `right` pointer is used to expand the window to include new characters.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - Both pointers `left` and `right` traverse the string at most once, resulting in linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: ***O(min(n, m))***
  - The space complexity is determined by the `Set`, which can contain at most `min(n, m)` unique characters, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set (e.g., 128 for ASCII).

# Code
```typescript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    let maxLen = 0;
    let left = 0, right = 0;
    const seen = new Set<string>();

    while (right < s.length) {
        if (!seen.has(s[right])) {
            seen.add(s[right]);
            right++;
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left);
        } else {
            seen.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
};
