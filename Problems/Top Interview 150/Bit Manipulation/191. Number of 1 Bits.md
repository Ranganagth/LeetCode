[191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

# Approach
To count the number of set bits, we can repeatedly use the bitwise AND operation to check if the least significant bit (LSB) is set to 1 and then right-shift the number by 1 bit until the number becomes 0.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is ***O(log n)***.

# Code
```typescript
function hammingWeight(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    while (n !== 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return count;
};

```
