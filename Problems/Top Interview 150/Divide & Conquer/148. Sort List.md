[148. Sort List](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)

# Intuition
To sort a linked list in ascending order, we can use Merge Sort due to its efficient time complexity of O(n log n) and O(1) memory space when implemented iteratively. Merge Sort is particularly suitable for linked lists because it can divide the list into two halves recursively, sort each half, and then merge them back together in sorted order.

# Approach
1. **Merge Sort Algorithm**:
   - **Divide**: Split the linked list into two halves using the slow and fast pointer technique.
   - **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half.
   - **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves back together to form a single sorted linked list.
2. **Base Case**:
   - If the list is empty or has only one node, it is already sorted, so return it.
3. **Recursive Sorting**:
   - Recursively sort the left half and the right half of the linked list.
4. **Merge Function**:
   - Merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.

# Explanation
1. **Divide**: Use the slow and fast pointer technique to split the linked list into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort each half until we reach a base case where the list has 0 or 1 node.
3. **Combine**: Merge the sorted halves back together by comparing nodes and linking them in ascending order.
4. **Iterative Merge Sort**:
   - We can implement an iterative version of the merge sort which uses constant space O(1) by using a bottom-up approach, starting with merging small sorted lists and gradually merging larger lists.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - Merge Sort has a time complexity of ***O(n log n)*** in the average and worst cases due to its recursive partitioning of the list and merging of sorted sublists.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The iterative version of Merge Sort has a space complexity of ***O(1)***, as it does not use any extra space beyond a few pointers.

    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function sortList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }
    
    const merge = (l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null => {
        const dummy = new ListNode();
        let current = dummy;
        
        while (l1 && l2) {
            if (l1.val < l2.val) {
                current.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {

    const findMiddle = (node: ListNode | null): ListNode | null => {

        while (fast && fast.next) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow!.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        if (prev) {
            prev.next = null;
        }
        
        return slow;

    const mergeSort = (node: ListNode | null): ListNode | null => {

        const mid = findMiddle(node);
        const left = mergeSort(node);
        const right = mergeSort(mid);
