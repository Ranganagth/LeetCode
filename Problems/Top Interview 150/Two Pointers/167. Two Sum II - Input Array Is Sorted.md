[167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

# Intuition
Given a sorted array, the two-pointer technique can be effectively used to find two numbers that add up to a specific target. This method leverages the fact that the array is sorted to efficiently narrow down the possible pairs of numbers that sum to the target.

# Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Initialize two pointers, one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
   - Calculate the sum of the elements at these two pointers.
   - If the sum is equal to the target, return the indices (adjusted for 1-based indexing).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
   - Continue this process until the pointers meet.
   
This approach ensures that we find the solution in linear time, and it uses constant extra space.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the array. This is because each element is processed at most once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, as only a few extra variables are used.

# Code
```typescript
function twoSum(numbers: number[], target: number): number[] {
    let left = 0;
    let right = numbers.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
        
        if (sum === target) {
            return [left + 1, right + 1];
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return [];
};
