[45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

# Intuition
The problem is to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index of the array, starting from the first index. Each element in the array represents the maximum jump length from that position. To solve this, a greedy algorithm can be utilized to make the optimal jump at each step. This ensures that we cover the maximum distance possible with the fewest jumps.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `jumps`: This variable will keep track of the number of jumps made.
   - `current_end`: This variable will denote the farthest point that can be reached with the current number of jumps.
   - `farthest`: This variable will keep track of the farthest point that can be reached with one more jump from the current segment.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Iterate through the array using a for loop up to the second last element (since reaching the last element is the goal).
   - For each index `i`, update the `farthest` point that can be reached from the current segment.
   - If the current index `i` is equal to `current_end`, it means we have reached the farthest point for the current number of jumps. Increment the jump counter and update `current_end` to `farthest`.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If the array has only one element, no jumps are needed, so return 0.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the total number of jumps needed to reach the last index.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function jump(nums: number[]): number {
    let jumps = 0;
    let current_end = 0;
    let farthest = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i]);

        if (i === current_end) {
            jumps++;
            current_end = farthest;
        }
    }

    return jumps;
};

```
