[169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

# Intuition
The problem is to find the majority element in an array, which is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. Given the constraint that a majority element always exists, we can leverage the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm to solve this problem in linear time and O(1) space.

# Approach
1. **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:**
   - This algorithm works by maintaining a candidate and a count. Initially, the count is set to 0 and there is no candidate.
   - We iterate through the array, and for each element:
     - If the count is 0, we set the current element as the candidate and set the count to 1.
     - If the current element is the same as the candidate, we increment the count.
     - If the current element is different from the candidate, we decrement the count.
   - Since the majority element appears more than half the time, it will be the candidate by the end of the iteration.

# Explanation
1. **Initialization:** Start with `count = 0` and no candidate.
2. **Iteration:**
   - For each element in the array:
     - If `count` is 0, set the candidate to the current element and set `count = 1`.
     - If the current element equals the candidate, increment the count.
     - If the current element does not equal the candidate, decrement the count.
3. **Result:** After the iteration, the candidate will be the majority element.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```TypeScript
function majorityElement(nums: number[]): number {
    let count = 0;
    let candidate = 0;

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (count === 0) {
            candidate = num;
        }
        count += (num === candidate) ? 1 : -1;
    }

    return candidate;
};

```
