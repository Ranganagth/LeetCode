[68. Text Justification](https://leetcode.com/problems/text-justification/)

# Intuition
The problem requires arranging words in lines such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully justified. The key challenge is to manage the spacing between words correctly, ensuring that the text looks properly aligned. 

# Approach
1. **Greedy Packing of Words:** Start by packing as many words as possible into each line without exceeding `maxWidth`.
2. **Space Distribution:**
   - For fully justified lines (not the last line), distribute the extra spaces evenly between words. If spaces don't divide evenly, the leftmost slots will get more spaces.
   - For the last line, left-justify the words and pad the end with spaces.
3. **Iterate Through Words:** Keep iterating through the words and applying the above rules until all words are processed.

# Explanation
1. **Initialization:** Initialize variables to keep track of the current line of words and the current length of the line.
2. **Word Packing:** Iterate through the words, adding them to the current line until adding another word would exceed `maxWidth`.
3. **Space Distribution and Justification:**
   - When the line is full (or it's the last word), distribute spaces:
     - If it's the last line or contains only one word, left-justify it.
     - Otherwise, distribute spaces between words as evenly as possible.
4. **Appending Last Line:** Ensure the last line is left-justified.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the total number of characters in all words. This is because we process each word and character exactly once.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(n)***, for storing the result.

# Code
```typescript
function fullJustify(words: string[], maxWidth: number): string[] {
    const result: string[] = [];
    let line: string[] = [];
    let lineLength = 0;

    for (let word of words) {
        if (lineLength + word.length + line.length > maxWidth) {
            let totalSpaces = maxWidth - lineLength;
            for (let i = 0; i < totalSpaces; i++) {
                line[i % (line.length - 1 || 1)] += ' ';
            }
            result.push(line.join(''));
            line = [];
            lineLength = 0;
        }
        line.push(word);
        lineLength += word.length;
    }

    result.push(line.join(' ') + ' '.repeat(maxWidth - lineLength - (line.length - 1)));
    return result;
};

```
