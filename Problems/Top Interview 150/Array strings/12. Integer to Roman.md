[12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

# Intuition
To convert an integer to a Roman numeral, we need to map specific integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral representations. By continuously subtracting the largest possible value that does not exceed the current integer and appending its corresponding Roman numeral, we can build the result.

# Approach
1. Define a list of tuples containing integer values and their corresponding Roman numeral strings, ordered from the largest to the smallest value.
2. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
3. Iterate over the list of tuples. For each tuple:
   - While the current integer is greater than or equal to the integer value in the tuple, append the corresponding Roman numeral to the result and subtract the integer value from the current integer.
4. Return the result string.

# Explanation
1. Create a list `valueSymbols` containing pairs of integers and their respective Roman numeral representations, ordered from largest to smallest.
2. Initialize an empty string `result` to accumulate the Roman numeral characters.
3. Loop through each pair in `valueSymbols`. For each pair:
   - Use a while loop to repeatedly append the Roman numeral to `result` and subtract the integer value from `num` as long as `num` is greater than or equal to the integer value.
4. Continue this process until `num` is reduced to zero.
5. Return the accumulated `result` string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The number of iterations is fixed and does not depend on the size of `num` since we always process the same set of Roman numeral values.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The space used to store the Roman numeral mappings and the result string is constant.

# Code
```typescript
function intToRoman(num: number): string {
    const valueSymbols: [number, string][] = [
        [1000, 'M'], [900, 'CM'], [500, 'D'], [400, 'CD'], [100, 'C'],
        [90, 'XC'], [50, 'L'], [40, 'XL'], [10, 'X'], [9, 'IX'],
        [5, 'V'], [4, 'IV'], [1, 'I']
    ];
    
    let result = '';

    for (const [value, symbol] of valueSymbols) {
        while (num >= value) {
            result += symbol;
            num -= value;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
