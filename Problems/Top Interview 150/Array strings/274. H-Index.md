[274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

# Intuition
The h-index is a measure of a researcher's productivity and citation impact. To determine the h-index, we need to find the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times. 

# Approach
1. **Sort the Citations:**
   - First, sort the citations array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Calculate h-index:**
   - Iterate over the sorted array and for each citation count, determine how many papers have at least that many citations. 
   - If the number of papers with at least that many citations is greater than or equal to the citation count, update the h-index.

# Explanation
1. **Sorting:** Sorting the citations helps us easily determine the number of papers that have at least a certain number of citations. 
2. **Iterating:** By iterating through the sorted list and checking the condition, we can efficiently find the h-index.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, as we do not use any extra space that scales with the input size.

# Code
```typescript
function hIndex(citations: number[]): number {
    citations.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let n = citations.length;
    
    let hIndex = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let h = n - i;
        if (citations[i] >= h) {
            hIndex = h;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return hIndex;
};
