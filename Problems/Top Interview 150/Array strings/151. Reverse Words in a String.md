[151. Reverse Words in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

# Intuition
We can split the string into an array of words, then reverse the array and join it back into a string.

# Approach
1. Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces.
2. Split the trimmed string into an array of words.
3. Reverse the array of words.
4. Join the array of words into a string with a single space between words.
5. Return the reversed string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```typescript
function reverseWords(s: string): string {
    return s.trim().split(/\s+/).reverse().join(' ');
};

```
