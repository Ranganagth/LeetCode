[189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

# Intuition
Rotating an array involves shifting its elements to the right by `k` positions. When the array is rotated, the elements that move past the last position come back to the start. A key observation is that rotating the array by `k` steps is equivalent to rotating by `k % n` steps, where `n` is the length of the array. This simplifies cases where `k` is larger than `n`.

# Approach
One efficient way to rotate the array in place is to use a three-step reversal approach:
1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements.

# Explanation
1. **Reverse the entire array:** This places the elements that need to be at the end of the rotated array at the beginning and vice versa.
2. **Reverse the first `k` elements:** This places the first `k` elements in their correct final positions.
3. **Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements:** This places the remaining elements in their correct final positions.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the input array. Each element is reversed three times.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(1)***, as we use a constant amount of extra space for the reversing operations.

# Code
```TypeScript
function rotate(nums: number[], k: number): void {
    const n = nums.length;
    k = k % n;
    function reverse(start: number, end: number): void {
        while (start < end) {
            [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    reverse(0, n - 1);
    reverse(0, k - 1);
    reverse(k, n - 1);
};

```
