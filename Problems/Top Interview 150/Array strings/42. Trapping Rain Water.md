[42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

# Intuition
The problem of trapping rain water can be visualized as finding how much water can be held between the heights of the bars in an elevation map. The key insight here is that water trapped above a bar is determined by the minimum of the maximum heights of bars to its left and right, minus the height of the bar itself.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using the two-pointer technique, which allows us to efficiently find the trapped water without requiring extra space for storing maximum heights. The two-pointer technique involves maintaining two pointers (one starting at the left end and the other at the right end) and moving them towards each other, while keeping track of the maximum heights encountered so far from both ends.

1. **Two-Pointer Initialization**: Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array respectively. Also, initialize `leftMax` and `rightMax` to keep track of the maximum heights encountered from the left and right ends, and `water` to store the total trapped water.

2. **Moving Pointers**: 
   - Move the pointers towards each other based on the comparison of the heights at the current pointers.
   - If `height[left]` is less than `height[right]`, it means the trapped water depends on the `leftMax`. If the current height at `left` is greater than or equal to `leftMax`, update `leftMax`. Otherwise, add the difference between `leftMax` and the current height to `water`. Then, move the `left` pointer one step to the right.
   - If `height[right]` is less than or equal to `height[left]`, the same logic applies but from the right side. Update `rightMax` if the current height at `right` is greater than or equal to `rightMax`. Otherwise, add the difference between `rightMax` and the current height to `water`. Then, move the `right` pointer one step to the left.

3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `left` meets `right`, and the total trapped water is stored in the `water` variable.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function trap(height: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = height.length - 1;
    let leftMax = 0;
    let rightMax = 0;
    let water = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                leftMax = height[left];
            } else {
                water += leftMax - height[left];
            }
            left++;
        } else {
            if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                rightMax = height[right];
            } else {
                water += rightMax - height[right];
            }
            right--;
        }
    }

    return water;
};
```
