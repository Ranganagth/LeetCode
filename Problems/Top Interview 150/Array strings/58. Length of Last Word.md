[58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)


# Intuition
To find the length of the last word in the string, we can start from the end of the string and move backwards until we encounter a non-space character. Once we find the start of the last word, we continue counting until we hit a space or reach the beginning of the string.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `length`: This variable will keep track of the length of the last word.
   - `foundWord`: This boolean flag helps in determining when we start counting the characters of the last word.

2. **Traverse the String**:
   - Start iterating from the end of the string.
   - Skip trailing spaces by continuing the loop until a non-space character is encountered.
   - Once a non-space character is found, set `foundWord` to `true` and start counting the characters.
   - Continue counting until we encounter a space or reach the beginning of the string.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once we've counted all characters of the last word, return the `length`.

# Complexity 
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. We use only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function lengthOfLastWord(s: string): number {
    let length: number = 0;
    let foundWord: boolean = false;

    for (let i = s.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] !== ' ') {
            foundWord = true;
            length++;
        } else if (foundWord) {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return length;
};

```
