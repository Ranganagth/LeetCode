[128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence in an unsorted array. A brute-force approach would involve sorting the array, but this would take **O(n log n)** time, which is not optimal. Instead, we can use a set to achieve the desired **O(n)** time complexity by leveraging the properties of consecutive sequences.

# Approach
1. **Use a Set**: First, insert all elements into a set. This allows *O(1)* average time complexity for checking the existence of elements.
2. **Identify Sequence Starts**: Iterate through the array and for each number, check if it's the start of a sequence (i.e., the previous number `num - 1` is not in the set).
3. **Expand Sequence**: For each identified start of a sequence, expand the sequence by incrementing the number until the sequence is no longer consecutive.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: Keep track of the maximum length of consecutive sequences found during the process.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)*** since each number is processed at most twice (once for checking sequence start and once for expanding sequence).
- **Space complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing elements in the set.

# Code
```typescript
function longestConsecutive(nums: number[]): number {
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let maxLength = 0;
  
    for (const num of numSet) {
        if (!numSet.has(num - 1)) {
            let currentNum = num;
            let currentLength = 1;

            while (numSet.has(currentNum + 1)) {
                currentNum++;
                currentLength++;
            }
  
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }
    }
    return maxLength;
};
