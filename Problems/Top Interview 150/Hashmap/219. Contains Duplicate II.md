[219. Contains Duplicate II](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/)

# Intuition
The basic idea is to traverse the array while maintaining a hash map that maps each element to its most recent index. For each element, we check if it already exists in the hash map and if the difference between the current index and the stored index is less than or equal to \(k\). If such a pair is found, we return true. If we complete the traversal without finding such a pair, we return false.

# Approach
1. **Initialize a hash map**: The hash map will store the value of the array elements as keys and their corresponding indices as values.
2. **Traverse the array**: For each element in the array, check if it is already in the hash map.
3. **Check the distance**: If the element is found in the hash map, check if the difference between the current index and the stored index is less than or equal to \(k\). If true, return true.
4. **Update the hash map**: If the element is not in the hash map or if the distance condition is not met, update the hash map with the current index.
5. **Return false**: If no such pair is found after traversing the array, return false.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we traverse the array once and each lookup or insertion in the hash map takes ***O(1)*** time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, as in the worst case, we might store all elements in the hash map.

# Code
```typescript
function containsNearbyDuplicate(nums: number[], k: number): boolean {
    const indexMap: Map<number, number> = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (indexMap.has(nums[i])) {
            const prevIndex = indexMap.get(nums[i]);
            if (i - prevIndex <= k) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        indexMap.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    return false;
};

```
