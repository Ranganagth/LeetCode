[290. Word Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/)

# Intuition
We need to establish a bijection between characters in the pattern and words in the string `s`. This requires us to check:
1. Each character in the pattern should map to exactly one word in `s`.
2. Each word in `s` should be mapped to by exactly one character in the pattern.

# Approach
1. **Splitting the String**: First, split the string `s` into an array of words.
2. **Mapping**: Use two maps:
   - `patternToWordMap`: This map will store the mapping of characters in the pattern to words in `s`.
   - `wordToPatternMap`: This map will store the mapping of words in `s` to characters in the pattern.
3. **Validation**: Iterate through each character in the pattern and the corresponding word in `s`:
   - Check if the character is already mapped to a different word or if the word is already mapped to a different character.
   - If either condition is true, return `false`.
   - Otherwise, establish the mapping in both maps.
4. **Edge Case**: Ensure that the lengths of the pattern and the split words from `s` are equal.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the pattern or the number of words in `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, where m is the number of unique characters in the pattern (which is constant, i.e., 26 lowercase letters).
# Code
```typescript
function wordPattern(pattern: string, s: string): boolean {
    const words = s.split(' ');
    if (pattern.length !== words.length) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const patternToWordMap = new Map<string, string>();
    const wordToPatternMap = new Map<string, string>();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < pattern.length; i++) {
        const char = pattern[i];
        const word = words[i];
        
        if (patternToWordMap.has(char)) {
            if (patternToWordMap.get(char) !== word) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            patternToWordMap.set(char, word);
        }
        
        if (wordToPatternMap.has(word)) {
            if (wordToPatternMap.get(word) !== char) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            wordToPatternMap.set(word, char);
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};
