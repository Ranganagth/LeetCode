[1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, we need to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. 

We can assume that each input has exactly one solution, and we cannot use the same element twice.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [2,7,11,15]` and `target = 9`, the output is `[0,1]`.
  - Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.
- For `nums = [3,2,4]` and `target = 6`, the output is `[1,2]`.
  - Because `nums[1] + nums[2] = 6`, we return `[1, 2]`.
- For `nums = [3,3]` and `target = 6`, the output is `[0,1]`.
  - Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 6`, we return `[0, 1]`.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `nums` is between `2` and `10^4`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is between `-10^9` and `10^9`.
- `target` is between `-10^9` and `10^9`.
- Only one valid answer exists.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using a hashmap to store the indices of elements as we traverse the array.

1. Create an empty hashmap `map` to store the indices of elements.
2. Iterate through each element `num` and its index `i` in the array `nums`:
   - Calculate the complement `complement = target - num`.
   - If `complement` exists in the `map`, return `[map.get(complement), i]`.
   - Otherwise, add `num` and its index `i` to the `map`.
3. If no such pair is found, return `null`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)*** , where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

# Code

```typescript
function twoSum(nums: number[], target: number): number[] {
    const map = new Map<number, number>();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];
        if (map.has(complement)) {
            return [map.get(complement)!, i];
        }
        map.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    return [];
};
```
