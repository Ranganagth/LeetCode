[222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

# Intuition
The problem can be solved efficiently by exploiting the properties of complete binary trees. Since the tree is complete, we can take advantage of the leftmost and rightmost paths to find the height of the tree. Once we know the height, we can determine the number of nodes using binary search. 

# Approach
1. Find the height of the complete binary tree by traversing down the leftmost path until reaching the leaf node.
2. Similarly, traverse down the rightmost path until reaching the leaf node to get the height.
3. If the heights are equal, the tree is a perfect binary tree, and the number of nodes can be calculated using the formula 2^h - 1, where h is the height of the tree.
4. If the heights are not equal, recursively count the nodes of the left and right subtrees until the base case is reached (i.e., a subtree with height 0).
5. The total number of nodes in the tree will be the sum of nodes in the left and right subtrees plus the root node.

# Explanation
1. By traversing down the leftmost and rightmost paths, we find the height of the complete binary tree efficiently. This approach reduces the time complexity compared to traversing the entire tree.
2. If the heights are equal, the tree is a perfect binary tree, and we can calculate the number of nodes directly using the formula 2^h - 1.
3. If the heights are not equal, we recursively count the nodes in the left and right subtrees until we reach a subtree with height 0.
4. The total number of nodes in the tree is the sum of nodes in the left and right subtrees plus one for the root node.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - Finding the height of the complete binary tree: ***O(log n)²*** (traversing the leftmost and rightmost paths)
  - Calculating the number of nodes: ***O(log n)²*** (binary search)
  - Total time complexity: ***O(log n)²***

- **Space complexity:**
  - *Space required for recursive calls:* ***O(log n)***
  - *Total space complexity:* ***O(log n)***

# Code
```TypeScript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function countNodes(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    let leftHeight = 0;
    let rightHeight = 0;
    let leftNode = root;
    let rightNode = root;
    
    while (leftNode) {
        leftHeight++;
        leftNode = leftNode.left;
    }
    
    while (rightNode) {
        rightHeight++;
        rightNode = rightNode.right;
    }
    
    if (leftHeight === rightHeight) {
        return Math.pow(2, leftHeight) - 1;
    }
    
    return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
};
