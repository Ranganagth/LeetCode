[114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

# Intuition
1. **Pre-order Traversal**: We need to visit each node in a pre-order fashion (node, left subtree, right subtree).
2. **In-place Transformation**: For each node, we should modify its left and right pointers to follow the flattened structure.

# Approach
We'll use an iterative method with a stack to simulate the pre-order traversal. This approach will allow us to avoid using additional space for recursion, hence achieving O(1) extra space complexity.

1. **Use a Stack**: Initialize a stack and push the root node.
2. **Process Nodes**: While the stack is not empty, pop the node from the stack and process it.
3. **Adjust Pointers**: Set the current node's right pointer to the top of the stack (if any) and set the left pointer to `null`.
4. **Push Children to Stack**: Push the right child first and then the left child to the stack to maintain the pre-order sequence.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree. The stack will hold at most h nodes, which corresponds to the depth of the deepest node.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function flatten(root: TreeNode | null): void {
    if (!root) return;

    const stack: TreeNode[] = [root];
    let prev: TreeNode | null = null;

    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const current = stack.pop()!;
        
        if (prev !== null) {
            prev.left = null;
            prev.right = current;
        }

        if (current.right !== null) {
            stack.push(current.right);
        }
        
        if (current.left !== null) {
            stack.push(current.left);
        }

        prev = current;
    }
};

```

### Explanation
- **TreeNode Class**: Defines the structure of the tree node.
- **flatten Function**: The main function to flatten the tree.
- **Stack**: Used to manage the pre-order traversal iteratively.
- **prev**: Keeps track of the previously processed node to adjust its pointers.
- **Processing**: For each node, adjust pointers and push its children to the stack in the correct order.
- **Example**: Demonstrates how to use the `flatten` function and print the flattened tree.
