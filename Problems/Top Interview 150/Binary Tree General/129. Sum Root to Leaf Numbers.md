[129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

# Intuition
The problem requires calculating the sum of all numbers formed by root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree. Each path from the root to a leaf forms a number by concatenating the values of the nodes along the path. To solve this, we need to traverse the tree and compute the numbers formed by each root-to-leaf path.

# Approach
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use a stack to perform an iterative DFS on the tree.
2. **Path Number Calculation**: As we traverse, maintain the current number formed by the path from the root to the current node.
3. **Leaf Check**: When a leaf node is reached, add the current number to the total sum.
4. **Push Child Nodes**: For each node, push its children onto the stack with the updated current number.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is processed once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)*** where *h* is the height of the tree, due to the stack used for DFS.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function sumNumbers(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!root) return 0;
    let sum = 0;
    const stack: [TreeNode, number][] = [[root, root.val]];

    while (stack.length) {
        const [node, currentSum] = stack.pop()!;
        const { left, right } = node;

        if (!left && !right) {
            sum += currentSum;
        }

        if (right) {
            stack.push([right, currentSum * 10 + right.val]);
        }

        if (left) {
            stack.push([left, currentSum * 10 + left.val]);
        }
    }

    return sum;
};
