[530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

# Intuition
In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the in-order traversal of the tree yields the node values in sorted order. By performing an in-order traversal, we can get a sorted list of node values and then compute the minimum absolute difference between consecutive values in this list.

# Approach
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get the node values in sorted order.
2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum absolute difference.
3. Traverse the sorted list of node values, computing the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive values, and update the minimum absolute difference accordingly.
4. Return the minimum absolute difference as the result.

# Explanation
1. In-order traversal of a BST gives the node values in ascending order.
2. By examining consecutive values in this sorted order, we can find the minimum absolute difference efficiently.
3. This approach ensures that we only need to consider pairs of consecutive values, which guarantees finding the minimum absolute difference.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The time complexity is ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to visit each node once during the in-order traversal.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(h)***, where h is the height of the tree. This is the space required for the recursion stack during the in-order traversal. In the worst case, h can be O(n) for a skewed tree, but it is O(log n) for a balanced tree.

# Code
```TypeScript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function getMinimumDifference(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    let prev: number | null = null;

    function inOrderTraversal(node: TreeNode | null) {
        if (!node) return;

        inOrderTraversal(node.left);

        if (prev !== null) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, node.val - prev);
        }
        prev = node.val;

        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    }

    inOrderTraversal(root);
    return minDiff;
};

```
