[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of counting the number of islands in a 2D binary grid, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). Each '1' in the grid represents land, and an island is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. By performing DFS, we can traverse the entire island and mark all connected '1's as '0' to avoid counting the same island multiple times.

# Approach

1. **Iterate through the grid**:
   - For each cell, if the cell contains a '1', it indicates the start of a new island.
   - Increase the island count by one.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - From the current cell (which is a '1'), use DFS to visit all connected cells (all cells connected vertically or horizontally).
   - Mark the visited cells as '0' to avoid revisiting them.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Check the boundaries of the grid during DFS to ensure we don't access out-of-bound indices.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** in the worst case for the recursion stack in DFS.

# Code
```typescript
function numIslands(grid: string[][]): number {
    if (grid.length === 0) return 0;

    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let count = 0;

    function dfs(row: number, col: number): void {
        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols || grid[row][col] === '0') {
            return;
        }

        grid[row][col] = '0';

        dfs(row + 1, col);
        dfs(row - 1, col);
        dfs(row, col + 1);
        dfs(row, col - 1);
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
                count++;
                dfs(i, j);
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Function Definition**:
   - `numIslands(grid: string[][]): number` takes a 2D binary grid and returns the number of islands.

2. **Edge Case**:
   - If the grid is empty, return 0.

3. **DFS Function**:
   - The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search to mark all connected land cells ('1') as visited ('0').

4. **Iterating through the Grid**:
   - For each cell in the grid, if it is a '1', it represents a new island. Increment the count and perform DFS from that cell to mark the entire island.

5. **DFS Implementation**:
   - The DFS checks boundary conditions and marks the cell as visited. It then recursively visits all adjacent cells.
