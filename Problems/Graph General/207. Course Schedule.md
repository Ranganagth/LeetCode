[207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We can represent the courses and their prerequisites as a directed graph. If the graph contains any cycle, then it is impossible to finish all courses. Otherwise, it is possible.

# Approach

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the directed graph.
2. Iterate through each course and its prerequisites, adding an edge to the adjacency list.
3. Create a visited array to keep track of visited nodes during DFS.
4. Perform DFS from each course:
   - If the current course is being visited during the current DFS traversal, then there is a cycle in the graph, and it is impossible to finish all courses. Return false.
   - Otherwise, mark the current course as visited and recursively explore its prerequisites.
5. If no cycle is found, return true.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(V + E)***, where ***V*** is the number of courses and ***E*** is the number of prerequisites.
- Space complexity: ***O(V + E)***, where ***V*** is the number of courses and ***E*** is the number of prerequisites.

# Code

```typescript
function canFinish(numCourses: number, prerequisites: number[][]): boolean {
    const adjList: Map<number, number[]> = new Map();
    const visited: number[] = new Array(numCourses).fill(0);
    
    for (let [course, prerequisite] of prerequisites) {
        if (!adjList.has(course)) {
            adjList.set(course, []);
        }
        adjList.get(course)!.push(prerequisite);
    }
    
    function dfs(course: number): boolean {
        if (visited[course] === -1) return false;
        if (visited[course] === 1) return true;
        
        visited[course] = -1;
        
        if (adjList.has(course)) {
            for (let prerequisite of adjList.get(course)!) {
                if (!dfs(prerequisite)) return false;
            }
        }
        
        visited[course] = 1;
        return true;
    }
    
    for (let course = 0; course < numCourses; course++) {
        if (!dfs(course)) return false;
    }
    
    return true;
};
