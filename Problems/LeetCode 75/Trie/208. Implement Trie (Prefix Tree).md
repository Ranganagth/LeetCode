[208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/)

# Intuition
A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. It is useful for searching strings with a given prefix efficiently.

# Approach
- We'll create a `TrieNode` class, which represents each node in the trie.
- Each `TrieNode` will have:
  - A map to store its children nodes. The key of this map will be the characters in the inserted words.
  - A boolean flag `isEndOfWord` to mark the end of a word.
- We'll implement the `Trie` class, which will use `TrieNode` to create a trie structure.
- The `Trie` class will have the following methods:
  - `insert(word: string)`: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
  - `search(word: string)`: Returns true if the string `word` is in the trie, and false otherwise.
  - `startsWith(prefix: string)`: Returns true if there is a previously inserted string that has the prefix `prefix`, and false otherwise.

# Explanation
- For each inserted word, we traverse the trie starting from the root.
- For each character in the word:
  - If the current node does not have a child corresponding to the character, we create a new node and add it as a child.
  - We then move to the child node and repeat the process for the next character.
- After inserting the entire word, we mark the last node as the end of a word.
- For the `search` method, we traverse the trie similarly to insertion, checking if each character exists as a child node.
- For the `startsWith` method, we also traverse the trie similarly but do not need to check if the last node is the end of a word.

# Complexity Analysis
- Let:
  - `(n)` be the length of the word for `insert` and `search` operations.
  - `m` be the length of the prefix for the `startsWith` operation.
- `insert`:
  - Time complexity: `O(n)` for inserting a word into the trie.
  - Space complexity: `O(n)` for storing the word in the trie.
- `search`:
  - Time complexity: `O(n)` for searching a word in the trie.
  - Space complexity: `O(1)`
- `startsWith`:
  - Time complexity: `O(m)` for searching a prefix in the trie.
  - Space complexity: `O(1)`

# Code
```Typescript
class TrieNode {
    children: Map<string, TrieNode>;
    isEndOfWord: boolean;

    constructor() {
        this.children = new Map();
        this.isEndOfWord = false;
    }
}

class Trie {
    root: TrieNode;

    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }

    insert(word: string): void {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
            }
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    search(word: string): boolean {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
        }
        return node.isEndOfWord;
    }

    startsWith(prefix: string): boolean {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of prefix) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
