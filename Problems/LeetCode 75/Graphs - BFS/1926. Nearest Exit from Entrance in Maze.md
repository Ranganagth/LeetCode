[1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/nearest-exit-from-entrance-in-maze/)

# Intuition:
- To find the nearest exit from the entrance in the given maze, we'll use breadth-first search (BFS).
- We'll start BFS from the entrance and explore neighboring cells until we find an exit or exhaust all possibilities.

# Approach:
1. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Initialize a queue to perform BFS.
   - Initialize a boolean matrix to keep track of visited cells.
2. **Perform BFS:**
   - Start BFS from the entrance cell.
   - Explore neighboring cells until we reach an exit or exhaust all possibilities.
3. **Return the Shortest Path Length:**
   - Return the length of the shortest path to an exit cell.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize a queue with the entrance cell and mark it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty:
   - Pop the front cell from the queue.
   - Check if the current cell is an exit cell. If yes, return the number of steps taken.
   - Explore the neighboring cells:
     - If a neighboring cell is valid, not visited, and is an empty cell, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
3. If no exit is found, return -1.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** We visit each cell at most once, so the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the maze.
- **Space Complexity:** We use a queue and a boolean matrix to store visited cells, which requires `O(m * n)` extra space.

# Code
```typescript
interface Coordinates {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}

function nearestExit(maze: string[][], entrance: [number, number]): number {
  const rows = maze.length;
  const cols = maze[0].length;

  const queue: Coordinates[] = [{ x: entrance[0], y: entrance[1] }];

  maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';

  let steps = 0;

  const directions = [{ x: -1, y: 0 }, { x: 0, y: 1 }, { x: 1, y: 0 }, { x: 0, y: -1 }];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    steps++;

    for (let count = queue.length; count > 0; count--) {
      const position = queue.shift();

      for (const direction of directions) {
        const newX = position.x + direction.x;
        const newY = position.y + direction.y;

        if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols && maze[newX][newY] === '.') {
          if (newX === 0 || newX === rows - 1 || newY === 0 || newY === cols - 1) {
            return steps;
          }

          queue.push({ x: newX, y: newY });
          maze[newX][newY] = '+';
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return -1;
};
```
