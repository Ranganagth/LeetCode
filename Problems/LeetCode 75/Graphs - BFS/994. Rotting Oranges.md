[994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

# Intuition:
We need to find the minimum number of minutes needed to rot all the fresh oranges in the grid. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to simulate the rotting process.

# Approach:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a queue to store the positions of the rotten oranges.
   - Find all the rotten oranges and add their positions to the queue.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of fresh oranges.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of minutes taken.

2. **BFS to spread rot:**
   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges:
     - Process all the oranges currently in the queue.
     - For each rotten orange, check its adjacent cells (up, down, left, and right).
     - If a fresh orange is found in an adjacent cell, mark it as rotten, add its position to the queue, and decrement the counter of fresh oranges.
     - Increment the number of minutes if any orange rots during this step.

3. **Check if all oranges are rotten:**
   - After BFS, check if there are any fresh oranges left.
   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes taken.
   - If there are fresh oranges left, it means they are unreachable, and we return -1.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** 
  - We traverse all cells of the grid once, so the time complexity is ***O(m * n)***, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - We use a queue to store the positions of the rotten oranges, which can have at most m * n elements. So, the space complexity is ***O(m * n)***.
# Code
```typescript
interface Coordinates {
  row: number;
  col: number;
}

function orangesRotting(grid: number[][]): number {
  const directions: Coordinates[] = [
    { row: -1, col: 0 }, 
    { row: 1, col: 0 },  
    { row: 0, col: -1 }, 
    { row: 0, col: 1 },  
  ];

  const rows = grid.length;
  const cols = grid[0].length;
  let freshOranges = 0;
  const queue: Coordinates[] = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
      if (grid[i][j] === 2) {
        queue.push({ row: i, col: j });
      } else if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
        freshOranges++;
      }
    }
  }

  let minutes = 0;

  while (queue.length > 0 && freshOranges > 0) {
    const size = queue.length;
    let hasRotten = false;

    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const { row, col } = queue.shift()!;

      for (const dir of directions) {
        const newRow = row + dir.row;
        const newCol = col + dir.col;

        if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < rows && newCol >= 0 && newCol < cols && grid[newRow][newCol] === 1) {
          grid[newRow][newCol] = 2; 
          queue.push({ row: newRow, col: newCol });
          freshOranges--;
          hasRotten = true;
        }
      }
    }

    if (hasRotten) {
      minutes++;
    }
  }

  return freshOranges === 0 ? minutes : -1;
};
