[1137. N-th Tribonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/)


# Intuition
The problem requires us to compute the nth term of the Tribonacci sequence using a recursive approach. The Tribonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- T0 = 0
- T1 = 1
- T2 = 1
- Tn+3 = Tn + Tn+1 + Tn+2 for n >= 0

# Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive function to calculate the nth Tribonacci number:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - T0 = 0
   - T1 = 1
   - T2 = 1

2. **Recursive Relation:**
   - Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 + Tn-3

3. **Stopping Condition:**
   - If n is 0, return 0.
   - If n is 1, return 1.
   - If n is 2, return 1.

4. **Memoization:**
   - Use an array `memo` to store the results of previously computed Tribonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

5. **Recursive Function:**
   - If the result for Tn is already computed, return it from `memo`.
   - Otherwise, compute Tn using the recursive relation and store the result in `memo` before returning.

# Explanation

- **Base Cases:** Handle the base cases directly since they are known values.
- **Memoization:** Use an array `memo` to store computed values to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.
- **Recursive Function:** `calculateTribonacci` is a helper function that uses memoization to compute Tn recursively based on the definition of the Tribonacci sequence.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***. Each Tribonacci number up to n is computed once and stored in the memoization array.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)***. The memoization array of size n is used.
# Code

```typescript
function tribonacci(n: number): number {
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;
    
    const memo: number[] = [];
    memo[0] = 0;
    memo[1] = 1;
    memo[2] = 1;
    
    function calculateTribonacci(num: number): number {
        if (memo[num] !== undefined) {
            return memo[num];
        }
        memo[num] = calculateTribonacci(num - 1) + calculateTribonacci(num - 2) + calculateTribonacci(num - 3);
        return memo[num];
    }
    
    return calculateTribonacci(n);
};

```

> This solution efficiently computes the nth Tribonacci number using recursion and memoization, ensuring that the solution runs within acceptable time limits even for the maximum constraint (n = 37).
