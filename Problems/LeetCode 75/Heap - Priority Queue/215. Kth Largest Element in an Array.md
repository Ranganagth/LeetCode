[215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

# Intuition
To find the k-th largest element in an array without sorting the entire array, you can use a min-heap of size k. This approach leverages the properties of heaps to efficiently track the k largest elements seen so far.

A min-heap of size k will allow us to maintain the k largest elements from the array as we iterate through it. The top of this min-heap (which is the smallest element in the heap) will always represent the k-th largest element.

# Approach

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: Use a min-heap to keep track of the k largest elements. The smallest element in the min-heap is at the root, and this element will be the k-th largest element as we progress.
2. **Iterate through the Array**: For each element in the array:
   - Add the element to the heap.
   - If the size of the heap exceeds k, remove the smallest element (which is at the root of the heap).
3. **Result**: After processing all elements, the root of the heap will be the k-th largest element.

> This method ensures we do not sort the entire array, which would be inefficient for large arrays.

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log k)***
  - Adding an element to the heap and removing the smallest element both take ***O(log k)*** time. Since we do this for each of the n elements, the total time complexity is ***O(n log k)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)***
  - We maintain a heap of size k.

# Code

```typescript
function findKthLargest(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const minHeap: number[] = [];
    function addToHeap(num: number) {
        minHeap.push(num);
        let i = minHeap.length - 1;
        while (i > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((i - 1) / 2);
            if (minHeap[parentIndex] <= minHeap[i]) break;
            [minHeap[i], minHeap[parentIndex]] = [minHeap[parentIndex], minHeap[i]];
            i = parentIndex;
        }
    }

    function removeFromHeap() {
        const last = minHeap.pop();
        if (minHeap.length === 0) return;
        minHeap[0] = last!;
        let i = 0;
        const length = minHeap.length;
        while (true) {
            const leftIndex = 2 * i + 1;
            const rightIndex = 2 * i + 2;
            let smallestIndex = i;
            if (leftIndex < length && minHeap[leftIndex] < minHeap[smallestIndex]) {
                smallestIndex = leftIndex;
            }
            if (rightIndex < length && minHeap[rightIndex] < minHeap[smallestIndex]) {
                smallestIndex = rightIndex;
            }
            if (smallestIndex === i) break;
            [minHeap[i], minHeap[smallestIndex]] = [minHeap[smallestIndex], minHeap[i]];
            i = smallestIndex;
        }
    }

    for (const num of nums) {
        addToHeap(num);
        if (minHeap.length > k) {
            removeFromHeap();
        }
    }

    return minHeap[0];
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **addToHeap Function**: Adds an element to the min-heap and maintains the heap property.
2. **removeFromHeap Function**: Removes the smallest element from the min-heap and rebalances the heap.
3. **Main Loop**: Iterates through the input array, adding elements to the heap. If the heap size exceeds k, the smallest element is removed to keep only the k largest elements in the heap.
4. **Result**: After processing all elements, the smallest element in the heap (minHeap[0]) is the k-th largest element in the array.
