[2542. Maximum Subsequence Score](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subsequence-score/)

# Intuition
The goal is to maximize the score defined by:
\[ \text{score} = (\text{sum of selected elements from nums1}) \times (\text{minimum of selected elements from nums2}) \]

To achieve this:
- We pair each element of `nums1` with the corresponding element in `nums2`.
- We sort these pairs primarily by the values in `nums2` in descending order, because larger values in `nums2` contribute more to the score.

Using a min-heap (priority queue) helps us efficiently manage the top `k` elements from `nums1` as we iterate through the sorted pairs.

# Approach
1. **Pairing and Sorting**:
   - Pair each element of `nums1` with the corresponding element in `nums2`.
   - Sort these pairs based on `nums2` in descending order. If two pairs have the same `nums2` value, sort by `nums1` in ascending order.

2. **Using a Min-Heap**:
   - Initialize a min-heap to maintain the smallest elements from the top `k` elements of `nums1`.
   - As you iterate through the sorted pairs:
     - Add the current element from `nums1` to the heap and update the sum of elements.
     - If the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the smallest element from the heap to maintain the size.
     - Calculate the potential score using the current sum and the current value from `nums2`, and track the maximum score encountered.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: 
     - Sorting the pairs takes ***O(n log n)***.
     - Each element insertion and deletion from the heap takes ***O(log k)***, and we do this for `n` elements.
     - Total time complexity is dominated by sorting: ***O(n log n)***.
   - **Space Complexity**: 
     - ***O(n)*** for storing the pairs and the min-heap.

# Code
```typescript
interface Pair<T, U> {
    first: T;
    second: U;
};

function maxScore(nums1: number[], nums2: number[], k: number): number {
    type Pair = { first: number, second: number };

    function comparator(a: Pair, b: Pair): number {
        if (a.first === b.first) {
            return a.second - b.second;
        } else {
            return b.first - a.first;
        }
    }

    const n = nums1.length;
    const pairs: Pair[] = new Array(n);

    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue();
    let maxScore = 0;
    let sum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        pairs[i] = { first: nums2[i], second: nums1[i] };
    }
    pairs.sort(comparator);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const { first: a, second: b } = pairs[i];
        sum += b;
        pq.enqueue(b);

        if (i < k - 1) continue;
        if (pq.size() > k) sum -= pq.dequeue().element;

        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, sum * a);
    }

    return maxScore;
};

```

> This solution efficiently computes the maximum possible score by leveraging sorting and a min-heap to manage the top `k` elements from `nums1`. By prioritizing larger elements from `nums2`, it ensures that the multiplication factor in the score calculation is maximized. This approach is both time-efficient and straightforward, handling the constraints provided by the problem effectively.
