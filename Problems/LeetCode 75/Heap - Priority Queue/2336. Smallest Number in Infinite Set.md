[2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-in-infinite-set/)

# Intuition
To implement the `SmallestInfiniteSet` class as described, we need a data structure that supports efficient operations for popping the smallest element and adding elements back to the set.

# Explanation
1. **Data Structures**:
   - `minHeap`: An array to store elements that have been added back. We sort it to maintain the heap property.
   - `addedBackSet`: A set to keep track of the elements added back, ensuring they are not added multiple times.
   - `currentSmallest`: An integer to keep track of the smallest element that has not been popped.

2. **Methods**:
   - **popSmallest()**:
     - If the heap is not empty, pop the smallest element from the heap (the root of the heap), remove it from the set, and return it.
     - If the heap is empty, return `currentSmallest` and increment `currentSmallest`.
   - **addBack(num)**:
     - If `num` is less than `currentSmallest` and not already in the set, add `num` to the heap and the set.
     - After adding `num` to the heap, sort the heap to maintain the heap property.

# Approach
1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a min-heap to efficiently manage and retrieve the smallest elements that are added back to the set.
   - Use a set to keep track of the elements that have been added back to ensure no duplicates in the heap.
   - Use an integer to track the smallest number that has never been popped.

2. **Operations**:
   - **Initialization**: Initialize the heap and set. The initial smallest number is 1.
   - **popSmallest()**: 
     - If the heap is not empty, pop the smallest element from the heap, remove it from the set, and return it.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - `popSmallest()`: \(O(\log k)\) for popping from the heap and adjusting the heap where \(k\) is the number of elements in the heap.
  - `addBack(num)`: \(O(\log k)\) for adding to the heap and \(O(k \log k)\) for sorting the heap. In practice, sorting is done only when necessary.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\) for storing the heap and set, where \(k\) is the number of elements added back.

# Code
```typescript
class SmallestInfiniteSet {
  private minHeap: number[];
  private addedBackSet: Set<number>;
  private currentSmallest: number;

  constructor() {
    this.minHeap = [];
    this.addedBackSet = new Set();
    this.currentSmallest = 1;
  }

  popSmallest(): number {
    if (this.minHeap.length > 0) {
      const smallestFromHeap = this.minHeap[0];
      this.minHeap.shift();
      this.addedBackSet.delete(smallestFromHeap);
      return smallestFromHeap;
    }
    
    return this.currentSmallest++;
  };

  addBack(num: number): void {
    if (num < this.currentSmallest && !this.addedBackSet.has(num)) {
      this.minHeap.push(num);
      this.addedBackSet.add(num);
      this.minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b); 
    }
  }
};

```

> This solution efficiently manages the operations needed for the `SmallestInfiniteSet` using a combination of heap and set for optimal performance.
