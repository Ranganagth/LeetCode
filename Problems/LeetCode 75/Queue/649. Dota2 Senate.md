[649. Dota2 Senate](https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/)
# Intuition:

- We will simulate the voting process in the senate.
- We will iterate through the senators and ban the senators of the opposite party.
- If a senator's right is banned, we skip them in the next round.
- We repeat this process until there is only one type of senator left.

# Approach:

- We will use two variables, `radiantBan` and `direBan`, to keep track of the bans.
- We will simulate the voting process by iterating through the `senate` string.
- If we encounter an 'R' (Radiant) senator and `radiantBan` is greater than 0, we decrement `radiantBan`.
- If we encounter an 'R' (Radiant) senator and `radiantBan` is 0, we increment `direBan` and add 'R' to the `newSenate` string.
- If we encounter a 'D' (Dire) senator and `direBan` is greater than 0, we decrement `direBan`.
- If we encounter a 'D' (Dire) senator and `direBan` is 0, we increment `radiantBan` and add 'D' to the `newSenate` string.
- After iterating through all senators, we update the `senate` string with the `newSenate` string.
- We repeat this process until there are no more senators left from one of the parties.

# Complexity Analysis:

The time complexity for this approach is **_O(n)_**, where n is the length of the `senate` string.

# Code

```typescript
function predictPartyVictory(senate: string): string {
  let radiantBan = 0;
  let direBan = 0;

  while (senate.includes("R") && senate.includes("D")) {
    let newSenate = "";
    for (const s of senate) {
      if (s === "R") {
        if (radiantBan > 0) {
          radiantBan--;
        } else {
          direBan++;
          newSenate += "R";
        }
      } else if (s === "D") {
        if (direBan > 0) {
          direBan--;
        } else {
          radiantBan++;
          newSenate += "D";
        }
      } else {
        newSenate += "X";
      }
    }
    senate = newSenate;
  }

  return senate.includes("R") ? "Radiant" : "Dire";
};
```
