[72. Edit Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

The problem at hand is to compute the minimum number of operations required to transform one string (`word1`) into another string (`word2`). The allowed operations are:
1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

To achieve this, we can utilize a dynamic programming approach, similar to the Levenshtein distance or Edit distance problem.

# Approach

Let's define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum number of operations required to convert the substring `word1[0...i-1]` to `word2[0...j-1]`.

#### Base Cases:
- If `i == 0`: To convert an empty string `word1[0...i-1]` to `word2[0...j-1]`, we need to insert `j` characters from `word2`. So, `dp[0][j] = j`.
- If `j == 0`: To convert `word1[0...i-1]` to an empty string `word2[0...j-1]`, we need to delete `i` characters from `word1`. So, `dp[i][0] = i`.

#### Recursive Relation:
To compute `dp[i][j]`:
1. If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]` because no operation is needed.
2. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` can be computed as:
   - Insert a character: `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
   - Delete a character: `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
   - Replace a character: `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`

   Take the minimum of the above three options.

#### Final Answer:
The value `dp[word1.length][word2.length]` will contain the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(m * n)***, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`, respectively. This is because we compute a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(m * n)***, for the `dp` array.

# Code:
```typescript
function minDistance(word1: string, word2: string): number {
    const m = word1.length;
    const n = word2.length;
    
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = i;  
    }
    
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = j;  
    }
    
    // Fill the dp array
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (word1[i - 1] === word2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]; 
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i][j - 1] + 1,  
                    dp[i - 1][j] + 1,   
                    dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 
                );
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
};

```

> This implementation calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2` using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach. The `dp` array is filled iteratively based on the relations defined above, and the final answer is returned as `dp[word1.length][word2.length]`.
