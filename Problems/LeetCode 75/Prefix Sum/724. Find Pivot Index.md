[724. Find Pivot Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/)
**Note:** This question is the same as 1991: [https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-middle-index-in-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-middle-index-in-array/)
# Intuition
We can solve this problem by first calculating the total sum of the array. Then, we'll iterate through the array, keeping track of the left sum and right sum. When the left sum is equal to the right sum, we'll return the current index as the pivot index.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `totalSum` to store the sum of all elements in the array.
2. Initialize a variable `leftSum` to 0 to store the sum of elements to the left of the current index.
3. Iterate through the array, updating `leftSum` by adding the current element.
4. If `leftSum` is equal to `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`, return the current index as the pivot index.
5. If no pivot index is found, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function pivotIndex(nums: number[]): number {
    let totalSum = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        totalSum += num;
    }
    
    let leftSum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (leftSum === totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
            return i;
        }
        leftSum += nums[i];
    }
    
    return -1;
};

```
