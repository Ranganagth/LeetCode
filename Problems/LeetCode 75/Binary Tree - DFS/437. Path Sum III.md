[437. Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

# Intuition
The idea is to traverse the tree using DFS, and at each node, compute the prefix sum from the root to that node. By using a hash map to store the frequency of prefix sums, we can quickly check how many times a required sum (current prefix sum minus target sum) has appeared before.

# Approach
1. **DFS Traversal**: Traverse the tree using DFS.
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: At each node, compute the current prefix sum (sum of all node values from the root to the current node).
3. **Use Hash Map**: Use a hash map to store the frequency of each prefix sum encountered.
4. **Check for Paths**: For each node, check if there is a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals the target sum.
5. **Update Hash Map**: Update the hash map with the current prefix sum before traversing the children and decrement it after traversing the children (backtracking).

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. The hash map can have up to \( n \) entries in the worst case.

# Code
Here is the TypeScript implementation of the solution:

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function pathSum(root: TreeNode | null, targetSum: number): number {
    const prefixSumCount: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    prefixSumCount.set(0, 1);

    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null, currentSum: number): number {
        if (!node) return 0;

        currentSum += node.val;
        const targetPrefixSum = currentSum - targetSum;
        let paths = prefixSumCount.get(targetPrefixSum) || 0;

        prefixSumCount.set(currentSum, (prefixSumCount.get(currentSum) || 0) + 1);

        paths += dfs(node.left, currentSum);
        paths += dfs(node.right, currentSum);

        prefixSumCount.set(currentSum, prefixSumCount.get(currentSum)! - 1);

        return paths;
    }

    return dfs(root, 0);
}
```

In this code:
1. **TreeNode**: Class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **pathSum**: Function calculates the number of paths that sum to `targetSum`.
3. **dfs**: Helper function performs a DFS traversal, updating and using the prefix sum hash map to count the number of valid paths.

> This approach ensures efficient calculation by leveraging prefix sums and a hash map, avoiding the need to recompute sums for every possible path repeatedly.
