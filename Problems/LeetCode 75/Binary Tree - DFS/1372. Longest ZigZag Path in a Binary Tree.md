[1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
A ZigZag path alternates between left and right child nodes. At each node, we can start a ZigZag path in either the left or right direction. As we traverse, we need to switch direction at each step and track the length of the path.

# Approach
1. **DFS Traversal**: We'll perform a DFS traversal of the tree, where each node has two potential ZigZag paths starting from it: one to the left and one to the right.
2. **Track Length**: For each node, we will maintain two values: the length of the ZigZag path if we move left from this node, and the length of the ZigZag path if we move right from this node.
3. **Update Maximum Length**: As we traverse, we will update the maximum length of any ZigZag path found so far.
4. **Recursive Function**: We'll define a recursive function that returns the lengths of ZigZag paths starting from each node in both directions.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack during DFS.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function longestZigZag(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    let maxLength = 0;

    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null, direction: string, length: number): void {
        if (!node) return;
        
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);

        if (direction === 'left') {
            dfs(node.left, 'right', length + 1);
            dfs(node.right, 'left', 1);
        } else {
            dfs(node.right, 'left', length + 1);
            dfs(node.left, 'right', 1);
        }
    }

    dfs(root, 'left', 0);
    dfs(root, 'right', 0);

    return maxLength;
};

```

In this code:
1. **TreeNode**: Class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **longestZigZag**: Function calculates the longest ZigZag path in the binary tree.
3. **dfs**: Helper function performs a DFS traversal and updates the maximum ZigZag path length. The `direction` parameter indicates the direction of the current path ('left' or 'right'), and the `length` parameter tracks the length of the current ZigZag path.

> The `dfs` function is called twice initially from the root node, once for each direction. This ensures that we explore all potential ZigZag paths starting from the root. The `maxLength` variable keeps track of the longest ZigZag path found during the traversal.
