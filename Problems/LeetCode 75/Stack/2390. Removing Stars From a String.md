[2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/removing-stars-from-a-string/)

# Intuition
To remove each star along with its closest non-star character to the left, we can use a stack. 

# Approach
1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. If the current character is a star and the stack is not empty, pop the top character from the stack.
3. Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
4. Finally, return the characters remaining in the stack after all stars have been processed.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity for this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.

# Code
```typescript
function removeStars(s: string): string {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    for (const char of s) {
        if (char === '*' && stack.length > 0) {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    return stack.join('');
};

```
