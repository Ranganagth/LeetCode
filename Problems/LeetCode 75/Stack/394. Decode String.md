[394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

# Intuition
To decode the given string, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through the characters of the string `s` and maintain two variables: `currentNum` to keep track of the number of times a substring should be repeated, and `currentStr` to store the current substring.

# Approach
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`.
   - If the character is a digit, update `currentNum`.
   - If the character is an opening bracket, push `currentNum` and `currentStr` onto the stack, and reset `currentNum` and `currentStr`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket, pop `prevNum` and `prevStr` from the stack. Update `currentStr` by repeating `prevStr` `prevNum` times and appending it to the current string.
   - If the character is a letter, append it to `currentStr`.
3. Return the final decoded string.

# Complexity Analysis
Since each character of the input string is processed only once, the `Time complexity` of this approach is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the input string. The `Space complexity` is also ***O(n)*** due to the stack used to store intermediate results. 

# Code

```typescript
function decodeString(s: string): string {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    let currentNum = 0;
    let currentStr = '';
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '[') {
            stack.push(currentStr);
            stack.push(currentNum.toString());
            currentStr = '';
            currentNum = 0;
        } else if (char === ']') {
            let num = parseInt(stack.pop()!);
            let prevStr = stack.pop()!;
            currentStr = prevStr + currentStr.repeat(num);
        } else if (!isNaN(Number(char))) {
            currentNum = currentNum * 10 + Number(char);
        } else {
            currentStr += char;
        }
    }
    
    return currentStr;
};
