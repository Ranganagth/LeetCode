[435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

# Intuition

To minimize the number of intervals to remove, we can use a greedy approach. We'll sort the intervals based on their end times. Then, we can iterate through the sorted intervals and remove the intervals that overlap with the previous ones.

# Approach

1. Sort the intervals based on their end times.
2. Initialize a variable `end` to store the end time of the last non-overlapping interval.
3. Initialize a variable `removed` to count the number of intervals to remove.
4. Iterate through the sorted intervals:
   - If the start time of the current interval is less than `end`, increment `removed`.
   - Otherwise, update `end` to the end time of the current interval.
5. Return `removed`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n log n)***, where n is the number of intervals.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
function eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals: number[][]): number {
    if (intervals.length === 0) return 0;
    
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let end = intervals[0][1];
    let removed = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
            removed++;
        } else {
            end = intervals[i][1];
        }
    }
    
    return removed;
};
