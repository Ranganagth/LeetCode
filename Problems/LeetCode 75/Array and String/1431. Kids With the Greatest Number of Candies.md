[1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/)

# Intuition
We can find the maximum number of candies among all kids and then check if each kid, after receiving extra candies, can have the maximum number of candies.

# Approach
1. Find the maximum number of candies among all kids.
2. Iterate through the array of candies.
3. For each kid, check if adding `extraCandies` to their current number of candies will make their total candies greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies.
4. Return an array indicating which kids can have the greatest number of candies after receiving extra candies.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```typescript
function kidsWithCandies(candies: number[], extraCandies: number): boolean[] {
    const maxCandies = Math.max(...candies);
    const result: boolean[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < candies.length; i++) {
        result.push(candies[i] + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
    }

    return result;
};

```
