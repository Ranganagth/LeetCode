[605. Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

# Intuition
We can iterate through the flowerbed and check if there are `n` consecutive empty plots available. We also need to consider the boundaries while checking for empty plots.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of consecutive empty plots.
2. Iterate through the flowerbed.
3. If the current plot is empty (`flowerbed[i] === 0`), increment `count`.
4. If the current plot is not empty or we have reached the end of the flowerbed, check if we can plant flowers based on the value of `count`.
5. If `count` is greater than or equal to `n`, return true.
6. After the loop, if `count` is greater than or equal to `n`, return true; otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed: number[], n: number): boolean {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
        if (flowerbed[i] === 0 && (i === 0 || flowerbed[i - 1] === 0) && (i === flowerbed.length - 1 || flowerbed[i + 1] === 0)) {
            flowerbed[i] = 1;
            count++;
        }
        if (count >= n) return true;
    }
    return false;
};
