[443. String Compression](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

# Intuition
We can use two pointers to traverse the array. One pointer `write` to write the compressed characters into the array `chars`, and another pointer `read` to read characters from the original array `chars`.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers `read` and `write` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array `chars` using the `read` pointer.
3. For each group of consecutive repeating characters:
   - Increment the `read` pointer until the characters are the same.
   - Write the character to `chars` using the `write` pointer.
   - If the group's length is greater than 1, convert the length to a string and write its characters to `chars`.
   - Increment the `write` pointer.
4. After the loop, return the `write` pointer, which indicates the length of the compressed array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function compress(chars: string[]): number {
    let read = 0;
    let write = 0;

    while (read < chars.length) {
        let count = 1;
        const currentChar = chars[read];
        read++;

        while (read < chars.length && chars[read] === currentChar) {
            read++;
            count++;
        }

        chars[write++] = currentChar;
        if (count > 1) {
            const countChars = count.toString().split('');
            for (let char of countChars) {
                chars[write++] = char;
            }
        }
    }

    return write;
};
