[450. Delete Node in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

# Intuition
To delete a node with a given key from a binary search tree (BST), we need to perform the following steps:
- Search for the node to delete.
- If the node is found, delete the node.

# Approach
1. **Search for the Node to Delete**: We traverse the BST to find the node with the given key.
   - If the current node's value is equal to the key:
     - If the node is a leaf node, we simply remove it.
     - If the node has only one child, we replace the node with its child.
     - If the node has two children, we find the node with the minimum value in its right subtree (or the maximum value in its left subtree), copy its value to the node to be deleted, and recursively delete the node with the copied value from the appropriate subtree.
2. **Delete the Node**:
   - If the node to be deleted is a leaf node, we return null.
   - If the node has only one child, we return its non-null child.
   - If the node has two children, we find the node with the minimum value in its right subtree (or the maximum value in its left subtree), copy its value to the node to be deleted, and recursively delete the node with the copied value from the appropriate subtree.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is ***O(height of tree)***.
  - In the worst case, the height of the tree is ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the tree. This happens when the tree is skewed.
  - In the average case, the height of the tree is ***O(log n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(height of tree)*** due to the recursive calls.
# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function deleteNode(root: TreeNode | null, key: number): TreeNode | null {
    if (!root) return null;

    if (root.val === key) {
        if (!root.left && !root.right) {
            return null;
        }
        if (!root.left) {
            return root.right;
        }
        if (!root.right) {
            return root.left;
        }
        let minRight = root.right;
        while (minRight.left) {
            minRight = minRight.left;
        }
        root.val = minRight.val;
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, minRight.val);
    } else if (root.val > key) {
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
    } else {
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
    }
    return root;
};
```

> This implementation ensures that the resulting tree remains a valid BST after deleting the node with the given key. It handles the three cases of node deletion (leaf node, node with one child, and node with two children) and maintains the BST property throughout the process.
