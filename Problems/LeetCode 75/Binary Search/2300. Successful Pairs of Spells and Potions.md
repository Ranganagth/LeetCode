[2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions](https://leetcode.com/problems/successful-pairs-of-spells-and-potions/)

# Intuition:
The problem requires us to find the number of successful pairs between spells and potions, where a pair is considered successful if the product of the spell's strength and the potion's strength is at least a given success threshold.
To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize binary search due to the sorted nature of the `potions` array. The idea is to perform a binary search for each spell to quickly find the number of potions that can form a successful pair with it.

# Approach:

1. **Sorting:** Start by sorting the `potions` array in ascending order.

2. **Binary Search:** For each spell:
   - Use binary search to find the smallest index in the sorted `potions` array such that `spell * potions[index]` is at least the given `successThreshold`.
   - This can be achieved by iterating over the `potions` array and using binary search to find the right boundary.

3. **Counting Successful Pairs:** For each spell, the number of successful pairs is the number of potions that meet the success criteria. This can be determined by subtracting the index found from the total number of potions.

4. **Complexity:** Since we perform a binary search for each spell, the time complexity is `O(n log m)`, where `n` is the number of spells and `m` is the number of potions.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log m)`, where `n` is the number of spells and `m` is the number of potions. Sorting the `potions` array takes `O(m log m)`, and performing binary search for each spell takes `O(n log m)`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, due to the space required to store the `successfulPairsCount` array.

# Code:

```typescript

function successfulPairs(spells: number[], potions: number[], successThreshold: number): number[] {
    potions.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
    const potionCount = potions.length;
  
    const successfulPairsCount: number[] = [];
  
    for (const spell of spells) {
        let left = 0;
        let right = potionCount;
      
        while (left < right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
          
            if (spell * potions[mid] >= successThreshold) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
      
        successfulPairsCount.push(potionCount - left);
    }
  
    return successfulPairsCount;
};

```
