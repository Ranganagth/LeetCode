[162. Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)

# Intuition
To find a peak element in the array `nums` in `O(log n)` time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Here's how we can achieve this:

# Approach:

1. **Binary Search Method:**
   - The main idea is to use binary search to find the peak element.
   - Start by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`, representing the bounds of the search.
   - Compute the middle index `mid`.
   - Compare the element at `mid` with its neighbors:
     - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, then `mid` might be a peak.
     - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, then the peak must be on the right side of `mid`.
   - Adjust the bounds (`left` or `right`) based on the comparison to move towards the peak.

2. **Termination Condition:**
   - The search terminates when `left` equals `right`. At this point, `left` (or `right`) is the index of the peak element.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `nums` has only one element, it is trivially a peak.
   - The constraints ensure that there's always at least one peak in the array.

# Explanation:

- **Initialization:** Start with `left = 0` and `right = nums.length - 1`.
- **Binary Search Loop:**
  - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
  - Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[mid + 1]`:
    - If `nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]`, then `mid` is a potential peak, but it may still not be the peak. Move `right` to `mid` to explore the left side.
    - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, then the peak must be on the right side. Move `left` to `mid + 1` to explore the right side.
- **Termination:** The loop terminates when `left == right`, at which point it is the peak index.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(log n)*** - Binary search reduces the search space by half each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)*** - Constant space is used.

# Code:

```typescript
function findPeakElement(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
};

```

> This algorithm efficiently finds the peak element using the binary search technique, meeting the ***O(log n)*** time complexity requirement.
