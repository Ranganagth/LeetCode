[374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

# Intuition
To solve the Guess Game problem, where you have to guess a number between 1 and n using a provided API `guess(num)`, we can employ a binary search approach. This is an optimal strategy because binary search reduces the search space by half after each guess, ensuring a logarithmic time complexity.

# Approach:

1. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to systematically narrow down the search space for the correct number.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, where `left = 1` and `right = n`.
   - Compute the midpoint `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`.
   - Use the `guess(mid)` function to determine if the picked number is higher or lower than `mid`.

2. **Adjust the Search Range**:
   - If `guess(mid) == 0`, then `mid` is the correct number and return it.
   - If `guess(mid) == -1`, then adjust the search range to `[left, mid-1]`.
   - If `guess(mid) == 1`, then adjust the search range to `[mid+1, right]`.

3. **Loop Until Found**:
   - Repeat the above steps until the correct number is found.

# Explanation:
- **Binary Search Setup**: Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the bounds of the search space.
- **Compute Midpoint**: Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
- **Guess the Number**: Use the `guess` function to determine if the midpoint is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Adjust the Search Range**: Depending on the result of `guess(mid)`, adjust the `left` or `right` pointers to narrow down the search space.
- **Loop Until Found**: Continue the loop until `left` exceeds `right`, at which point the correct number has been found.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***. Binary search reduces the search space by half with each guess.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***. Constant extra space is used.
# Code
```typescript
function guessNumber(n: number): number {
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        let result = guess(mid);
        
        if (result === 0) {
            return mid;
        } else if (result === -1) {
            right = mid - 1;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};
```
