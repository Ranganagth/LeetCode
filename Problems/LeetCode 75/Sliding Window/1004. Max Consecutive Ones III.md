[1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using the sliding window technique. We'll maintain a window of consecutive ones and keep track of the number of zeros encountered within the window. We'll update the maximum length of the window.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, and set them to 0.
2. Initialize a variable `maxOnes` to 0 to store the maximum length of consecutive ones found so far.
3. Iterate through the array `nums` from index 0 to `nums.length - 1`.
   - If `nums[right]` is 0, decrement `k`.
   - If `k` becomes negative, increment `left` until `k` becomes non-negative.
   - Update `maxOnes` with the maximum length of consecutive ones found so far.
4. After the loop, return `maxOnes`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function longestOnes(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let maxOnes = 0;
    let left = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        if (nums[right] === 0) {
            k--;
        }
        
        while (k < 0) {
            if (nums[left] === 0) {
                k++;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        maxOnes = Math.max(maxOnes, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxOnes;
};
