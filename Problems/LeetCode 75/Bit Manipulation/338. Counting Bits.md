[338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

# Approach
We can use the Hamming weight function from the previous solution to count the number of set bits for each number from 0 to n.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is ***O(n log n)***.

# Code
```typescript
function countBits(n: number): number[] {
    const ans: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        ans.push(hammingWeight(i));
    }
    return ans;
}

function hammingWeight(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    while (n !== 0) {
        count += n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return count;
};
```
