[136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

To solve this problem with linear runtime complexity and constant extra space, we can utilize the bitwise XOR operation. XOR has a useful property that when applied to the same number twice, it cancels out, i.e., \( a \oplus a = 0 \). Additionally, XOR is commutative and associative, so the order of operations doesn't matter.

Given the problem constraints, where each element in the array appears exactly twice except for one element that appears once, we can use XOR to find the unique element efficiently.

# Approach:

1. **Initialize a Variable**: Start with a variable `singleNumber` initialized to 0.
2. **Iterate Through Array**: Iterate through all elements in the array.
3. **Use XOR Operation**: For each element, update `singleNumber` using the XOR operation.
   - `singleNumber = singleNumber ^ nums[i]`
4. **Output**: After iterating through the array, `singleNumber` will contain the unique element.

### Explanation:
- XORing a number with itself is zero: \( a \oplus a = 0 \).
- XORing a number with zero returns the number itself: \( a \oplus 0 = a \).
- Since all numbers except one appear twice, the XOR operation will cancel out all pairs, leaving only the unique number.

### Example:
Let's walk through an example to illustrate how this works:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4

singleNumber = 0
singleNumber = 0 ^ 4 = 4
singleNumber = 4 ^ 1 = 5
singleNumber = 5 ^ 2 = 7
singleNumber = 7 ^ 1 = 6
singleNumber = 6 ^ 2 = 4

After processing all elements, singleNumber = 4, which is the unique number.
```
# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the `nums` array. We iterate through the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function singleNumber(nums: number[]): number {
    let singleNumber = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        singleNumber ^= num;
    }
    return singleNumber;
};

```
