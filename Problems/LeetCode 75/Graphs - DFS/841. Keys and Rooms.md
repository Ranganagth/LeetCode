[841. Keys and Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse the rooms and keep track of the visited rooms. We start by visiting room 0 and add all the keys in room 0 to a queue or stack. Then, we continue visiting rooms using BFS or DFS until we have visited all the rooms or until there are no more rooms to visit.

# Approach
1. Start by visiting room 0 and add all the keys in room 0 to a queue or stack.
2. While the queue or stack is not empty:
   - Remove a key from the queue or stack and visit the corresponding room.
   - Add all the keys in the visited room to the queue or stack if they haven't been visited before.
3. Keep track of visited rooms to avoid visiting the same room multiple times.
4. If all rooms have been visited, return true; otherwise, return false.

# Complexity Analysis
- The time complexity of this approach is ***O(n + m)***, where ***n*** is the number of rooms and ***m*** is the total number of keys.
- The space complexity is ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of rooms.

# Code 
```typescript
function canVisitAllRooms(rooms: number[][]): boolean {
    const n = rooms.length;
    const visited = new Set<number>();
    const stack: number[] = [0]; // Start from room 0

    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const room = stack.pop()!;
        visited.add(room);

        for (const key of rooms[room]) {
            if (!visited.has(key)) {
                stack.push(key);
            }
        }
    }

    return visited.size === n;
};

```

> This implementation ensures that we visit all the rooms using depth-first search (DFS) and return true if we can visit all the rooms. Otherwise, it returns false.
