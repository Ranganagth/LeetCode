[399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

# Intuition:
- We'll represent the given equations as a weighted directed graph.
- Each variable will be a node in the graph, and the weight of the edge between nodes `A` and `B` will be `values[i]` if `equations[i]` is `[A, B]`.
- To solve a query `C / D`, we'll perform a depth-first search (DFS) from node `C` to node `D`, multiplying the weights of the edges along the path.

# Approach:
1. **Build the Graph:**
   - Iterate through the equations and values arrays.
   - For each equation `[A, B]`, add an edge from `A` to `B` with weight `values[i]`, and add a reverse edge from `B` to `A` with weight `1 / values[i]`.
2. **Perform DFS for Queries:**
   - For each query `[C, D]`:
     - If `C` or `D` is not in the graph, push `-1.0` to the results.
     - Otherwise, perform a depth-first search (DFS) from node `C` to node `D`, multiplying the weights of the edges along the path.
3. **Return the Results:** Return the array of results.

# Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Building the graph takes `O(E)` time, where `E` is the number of equations.
  - Performing DFS for each query takes `O(V)` time, where `V` is the number of variables.
  - So, the overall time complexity is `O(E + VQ)`, where `Q` is the number of queries.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(E + V)`, where `E` is the number of equations and `V` is the number of variables.

# Code
```TypeScript
function calcEquation(equations: string[][], values: number[], queries: string[][]): number[] {
    const graph = buildGraph(equations, values);

    const results: number[] = [];

    for (const [start, end] of queries) {
        if (!(start in graph) || !(end in graph)) {
            results.push(-1.0);
        } else {
            const visited = new Set<string>();
            results.push(dfs(graph, start, end, visited));
        }
    }

    return results;
}

function buildGraph(equations: string[][], values: number[]): Graph {
    const graph: Graph = {};

    for (let i = 0; i < equations.length; i++) {
        const [source, target] = equations[i];
        const weight = values[i];

        if (!(source in graph)) {
            graph[source] = [];
        }
        graph[source].push({ target, weight });

        if (!(target in graph)) {
            graph[target] = [];
        }
        graph[target].push({ target: source, weight: 1 / weight });
    }

    return graph;
}

function dfs(graph: Graph, start: string, end: string, visited: Set<string>): number {
    if (start === end) return 1.0;

    visited.add(start);

    for (const { target, weight } of graph[start] || []) {
        if (!visited.has(target)) {
            const result = dfs(graph, target, end, visited);
            if (result !== -1.0) {
                return weight * result;
            }
        }
    }

    return -1.0;
};

// Type definitions
type Edge = { target: string, weight: number };
type Graph = { [key: string]: Edge[] };
