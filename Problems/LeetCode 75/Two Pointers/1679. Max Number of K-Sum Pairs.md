[1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-number-of-k-sum-pairs/)

# Intuition
We can solve this problem using a hashmap to store the frequency of each number in the array. Then, for each number in the array, we can check if its complement exists in the hashmap. If it does, we can remove both numbers and increment the count of operations.

# Approach
1. Initialize a hashmap `frequencyMap` to store the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Initialize a variable `operations` to keep track of the count of operations.
3. Iterate through the array `nums`.
   - If `k - nums[i]` exists in `frequencyMap` and its frequency is greater than 0, increment `operations` and decrement the frequency of `k - nums[i]`.
4. After the loop, return the count of operations.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```typescript
function maxOperations(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const frequencyMap: { [key: number]: number } = {};
    let operations = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (frequencyMap[k - num] && frequencyMap[k - num] > 0) {
            operations++;
            frequencyMap[k - num]--;
        } else {
            frequencyMap[num] = (frequencyMap[num] || 0) + 1;
        }
    }

    return operations;
};
