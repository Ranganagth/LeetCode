[283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

# Intuition
We can use the two-pointer technique to solve this problem. We'll maintain two pointers: one for iterating through the array (`readPointer`) and the other for pointing to the position where the next non-zero element should be placed (`writePointer`).

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `writePointer` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array using the `readPointer`.
3. If the current element is non-zero, move it to the position pointed by the `writePointer` and increment `writePointer`.
4. After the loop, fill the remaining positions from `writePointer` to the end of the array with zeros.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function moveZeroes(nums: number[]): void {
    let writePointer = 0;

    for (let readPointer = 0; readPointer < nums.length; readPointer++) {
        if (nums[readPointer] !== 0) {
            nums[writePointer++] = nums[readPointer];
        }
    }

    while (writePointer < nums.length) {
        nums[writePointer++] = 0;
    }
};

```
