[28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to find the first occurrence of the string `needle` in the string `haystack`. This is a classic problem that can be efficiently solved using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm, which uses a preprocessing step to create a partial match table (also known as the "pi" table) to skip unnecessary comparisons.

# Approach
1. **Check Edge Cases:** If `needle` is an empty string, return 0 because an empty string is always found at index 0 in any string.
  
2. **KMP Algorithm Preparation:**
   - **Build the Partial Match Table (pi table):** This table helps us determine how much to skip in the `needle` string when a mismatch occurs during the search.
     - Initialize `pi[0] = 0`.
     - Iterate through the `needle` string to fill the `pi` table.
     - If there is a mismatch, adjust the prefix index accordingly using previously computed values.

3. **Search Using the KMP Algorithm:**
   - Iterate through the `haystack` string using two pointers, `i` (for `haystack`) and `j` (for `needle`).
   - If characters match, move both pointers forward.
   - If characters do not match and `j` is not 0, use the `pi` table to determine the new position of `j` to continue the search efficiently.
   - If `j` reaches the length of `needle`, it means we found a match, and return the starting index.

4. **Handle No Match:** If we exhaust the search without finding a match, return `-1`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n + m)***, where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`. This is because building the `pi` table takes *O(m) time and searching through `haystack` takes *O(n)* time.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(m)***, where `m` is the length of `needle`. This is because we use the `pi` table of size `m`.

# Code
```typescript
function strStr(haystack: string, needle: string): number {
    if (needle.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    const pi = new Array(needle.length).fill(0);
    let j = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < needle.length; i++) {
        while (j > 0 && needle[i] !== needle[j]) {
            j = pi[j - 1];
        }
        if (needle[i] === needle[j]) {
            pi[i] = ++j;
        } else {
            pi[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    
    j = 0; 
    for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
        while (j > 0 && haystack[i] !== needle[j]) {
            j = pi[j - 1];
        }
        if (haystack[i] === needle[j]) {
            if (++j === needle.length) {
                return i - needle.length + 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};
