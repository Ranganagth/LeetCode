[6. Zigzag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem involves converting a given string into a zigzag pattern when written in rows, and then reading the rows column by column to form the final converted string. The main challenge is to correctly position each character in the zigzag pattern according to the number of rows specified.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize an array of strings to represent each row in the zigzag pattern.
2. Iterate through the string character by character and place each character in the appropriate row based on the current direction (going down or up).
3. Adjust the direction whenever the top or bottom row is reached.
4. Concatenate all rows together to form the final converted string.

# Explanation
<!--- Provide detailed explanation for the given Approach or explain the solution. -->
- We create an array `rows` where each element represents a row in the zigzag pattern.
- We iterate through each character of the input string `s`, appending each character to the current row based on the current direction (`goingDown`).
- Whenever we reach the topmost row (`row === 0`) or the bottommost row (`row === numRows - 1`), we reverse the direction.
- Finally, we concatenate all rows to get the result string which represents the zigzag conversion of the input string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - We iterate through each character in the string exactly once, where `n` is the length of the string.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***
  - The space complexity is dominated by the space required to store the rows array, which has `numRows` entries and can hold up to `n` characters in total.

# Code

### Solution 1:
```typescript
function convert(s: string, numRows: number): string {
    if (numRows === 1) return s;

    const rows: string[] = new Array(numRows).fill('');
    let row = 0;
    let goingDown = false;

    for (let char of s) {
        rows[row] += char;
        if (row === 0 || row === numRows - 1) {
            goingDown = !goingDown;
        }
        row += goingDown ? 1 : -1;
    }

    return rows.join('');
};
```

### Solution 2:
```typescript
function convert(s: string, numRows: number): string {
    if (numRows === 1) return s;

    const rows: string[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(numRows, s.length); i++) {
        rows[i] = '';
    }

    let goingDown = false;
    let row = 0;
    for (let char of s) {
        rows[row] += char;
        if (row === 0 || row === numRows - 1) {
            goingDown = !goingDown;
        }
        row += goingDown ? 1 : -1;
    }

    let result = '';
    for (let rowStr of rows) {
        result += rowStr;
    }
  
    return result;
};
