[80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to remove duplicates from a sorted array such that each unique element appears at most twice. We need to modify the array in-place and maintain the relative order of the elements. Given the sorted nature of the array, we can use a two-pointer approach to efficiently solve this problem.

# Approach
1. **Two-pointer technique:** We will use two pointers, `i` and `j`. Pointer `i` will track the position to place the next valid element, and pointer `j` will iterate through the array.
2. **Counting occurrences:** We maintain a count of the current element's occurrences. If an element appears more than twice, it will not be moved to the front part of the array.
3. **In-place modification:** As we iterate through the array with `j`, we update the array in place using `i` to ensure that each unique element appears at most twice.
4. **Return the new length:** At the end, `i` will give us the length of the modified array where each element appears at most twice.

# Explanation
1. **Initialization:** Start with `i = 0` to place elements and `count = 1` since the first element is always considered.
2. **Iteration:** For each element from `j = 1` to the end of the array:
   - If the current element `nums[j]` is the same as the previous one `nums[j-1]`, increment the count.
   - If the count is less than or equal to 2, place the element at `nums[i]` and increment `i`.
   - If the current element `nums[j]` is different from the previous one, reset the count to 1 and place the element at `nums[i]`.
3. **Result:** The pointer `i` gives us the length of the new array with elements appearing at most twice.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity:** O(1), as we are modifying the array in place without using any extra space.

# Code
```TypeScript
function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    let i = 1;
    let count = 1;

    for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] === nums[j - 1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 1;
        }

        if (count <= 2) {
            nums[i] = nums[j];
            i++;
        }
    }

    return i;
};

```
