[135. Candy](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/)

# Intuition
The problem of distributing candies can be broken down into ensuring that every child gets at least one candy, and children with higher ratings receive more candies than their neighbors. To achieve this, we need to perform two passes through the list of ratings to ensure all conditions are met.

# Approach
1. **Initialize Candies:** Start by giving each child one candy.
2. **Left to Right Pass:** Ensure that every child who has a higher rating than the previous child gets more candies than the previous child.
3. **Right to Left Pass:** Ensure that every child who has a higher rating than the next child gets more candies than the next child. This step also ensures that the result from the left to right pass is maintained.

# Explanation
- **First Pass (Left to Right):** By traversing from left to right, we ensure that if a child has a higher rating than the child before, they receive more candies than the previous child.
- **Second Pass (Right to Left):** By traversing from right to left, we adjust the candies distribution to ensure that each child who has a higher rating than the next child gets more candies, while still maintaining the result from the first pass.
- This two-pass approach ensures that all the conditions are met efficiently.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of children. We traverse the list twice.
- **Space complexity:** ***O(n)***, where n is the number of children. This space is used for the candies array.

# Code
```typescript
function candy(ratings: number[]): number {
    let n = ratings.length;
    let candies = new Array(n).fill(1);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
            candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return candies.reduce((sum, candy) => sum + candy, 0);
};
