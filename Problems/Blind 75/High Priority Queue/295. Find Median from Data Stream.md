[295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

# Intuition
To find the median of a stream of integers, we can use two heaps: a max-heap to store the smaller half of the numbers and a min-heap to store the larger half. This allows us to quickly access the middle elements of the stream.

# Approach
1. We initialize two arrays: `small` to store the smaller half of the numbers (implemented as a max-heap) and `large` to store the larger half of the numbers (implemented as a min-heap).
2. We define a `heappush` function to push a new value into the heap and maintain the heap property by sorting the array after each insertion.
3. We define a `heappop` function to pop the root element of the heap.
4. In the `addNum` function, we add the number to the `small` heap and then move the top element from `small` to `large`. If the size of `large` becomes greater than `small`, we move the top element from `large` back to `small`.
5. In the `findMedian` function, we return the median based on the sizes of `small` and `large`.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity for adding a number: ***O(log n)***, where n is the number of elements in the heap.
- Time complexity for finding the median: ***O(1)***.
- Space complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the heap.

# Code

```typescript
class MedianFinder {
    private small: number[]; 
    private large: number[]; 

    constructor() {
        this.small = [];
        this.large = [];
    }

    addNum(num: number): void {
        this.heappush(this.small, -num);
        this.heappush(this.large, -this.heappop(this.small));

        if (this.large.length > this.small.length) {
            this.heappush(this.small, -this.heappop(this.large));
        }
    }

    findMedian(): number {
        if (this.small.length > this.large.length) {
            return -this.small[0];
        } else if (this.small.length === this.large.length) {
            return (-this.small[0] + this.large[0]) / 2;
        } else {
            return this.large[0];
        }
    }

    private heappush(heap: number[], val: number): void {
        heap.push(val);
        heap.sort((a, b) => a - b); 
    }

    private heappop(heap: number[]): number {
        return heap.shift()!; 
    }
};

```

> This solution uses two heaps to efficiently find the median of a stream of integers. It adds a number to the stream in *O(log n)* time and finds the median in *O(1)* time.
