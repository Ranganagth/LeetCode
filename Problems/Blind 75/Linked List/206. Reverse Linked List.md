[Reverse Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
You're given the head of a singly linked list, and you need to reverse the list and return the reversed list.

### Example:
- For the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, the output should be `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

# Approach
We'll implement both iterative and recursive approaches to reverse a linked list.

### Iterative Approach:
1. Initialize three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`.
2. Start with `prev = null` and `curr = head`.
3. While `curr` is not null, do the following:
    - Store `curr.next` in `next`.
    - Set `curr.next` to `prev`.
    - Move `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next`.
4. After the loop, update `head` to `prev`, which will be the new head of the reversed linked list.
5. Return `head`.

### Recursive Approach:
1. The recursive approach is a little tricky, but very intuitive.
2. If the current node or the next node is null, return the current node.
3. Otherwise, recursively reverse the rest of the linked list.
4. Update `curr.next.next` to `curr`.
5. Set `curr.next` to null.
6. Return the new head of the reversed linked list, which will be the last node of the original list.

# Complexity Analysis
Both iterative and recursive approaches have a time complexity of ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we traverse the list only once. The space complexity of the recursive approach is ***O(n)*** due to the call stack, while the iterative approach has a space complexity of ***O(1)***.

# Code

### Iterative Approach:
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function reverseList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    let prev: ListNode | null = null;
    let curr: ListNode | null = head;
    
    while (curr) {
        const next: ListNode | null = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
    }
    
    return prev;
};
```

### Recursive Approach:
```typescript
function reverseList(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;
    
    const newHead = reverseList(head.next);
    head.next.next = head;
    head.next = null;
    
    return newHead;
};
```
