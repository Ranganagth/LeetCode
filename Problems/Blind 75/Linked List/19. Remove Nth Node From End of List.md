[Remove Nth Node From End of List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

# Intuition
To remove the nth node from the end of the list, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll use two pointers, fast and slow, with a gap of n nodes between them. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the node just before the one to be removed.

# Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, fast and slow, both pointing to the head of the list.
2. Move the fast pointer n steps forward.
3. Move both pointers simultaneously until the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
4. Remove the nth node by updating the next pointer of the node pointed to by the slow pointer.
5. Return the head of the modified list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(sz)***, where **sz** is the number of nodes in the list.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode | null, n: number): ListNode | null {
    if (!head) return null;

    let dummyHead: ListNode | null = new ListNode(0);
    dummyHead.next = head;
    let fast: ListNode | null = dummyHead;
    let slow: ListNode | null = dummyHead;

    // Move the fast pointer n steps forward
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        if (fast) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
    }

    // Move both pointers simultaneously until the fast pointer reaches the end
    while (fast) {
        fast = fast.next;
        slow = slow!.next;
    }

    // Remove the nth node
    if (slow && slow.next) {
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
    }

    return dummyHead.next;
};
```
