[190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

# Approach
To reverse the bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer, we can iterate through each bit of the input integer `n`, extract the least significant bit, and append it to the result. We can extract the least significant bit using the bitwise AND operator with `1`. After extracting the bit, we shift the input integer to the right by one position to process the next bit.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is ***O(1)***.

# Code
```typescript
function reverseBits(n: number): number {
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        result <<= 1;
        result |= n & 1;
        n >>>= 1;
    }
    return result >>> 0;
};

```
