[268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

# Intuition
We know that the sum of the first *n* natural numbers is given by the formula:

$$\text{sum} = \frac{{n \times (n + 1)}}{2}$$

To find the missing number in the range from 0 to *n*, we first calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to *n* using this formula. Then, we calculate the sum of all numbers in the given array `nums`. The missing number will be the difference between the sum of the numbers in the range and the sum of the numbers in the array.

For instance, if `nums = [3, 0, 1]` and *n* is 3, then:

- The sum of all numbers from 0 to 3 is `sum = 3 * (3 + 1) / 2 = 6`.
- The sum of the numbers in the array `nums` is `3 + 0 + 1 = 4`.
- Therefore, the missing number is `sum - numsSum = 6 - 4 = 2`.

# Approach
1. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 0 to *n* using the formula `sum = n * (n + 1) / 2`.
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers in the given array `nums`.
3. Return the difference between `sum` and `numsSum` as the missing number.
# Complexity Analysis

Both the time and space complexity of this approach are ***O(𝑛)***.
# Code
```typescript
function missingNumber(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    let sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
    let numsSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    return sum - numsSum;
};

```
