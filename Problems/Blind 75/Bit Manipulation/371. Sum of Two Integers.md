[371. Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

# Intuition
To add two numbers without using the `+` and `-` operators, we can use the bitwise XOR operation to add the bits and bitwise AND operation followed by a left shift by 1 to carry the bits.

# Approach
1. Perform the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` to add the bits.
2. Perform the bitwise AND of `a` and `b`, then left shift the result by 1 to carry the bits.
3. Add the carry to the result of the XOR operation.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 until there is no carry.

# Complexity Analysis
- The `time complexity` of this code is ***O(1)*** because the number of iterations in the `while` loop is constant, bounded by the number of bits in the integer representation, which is 32 in this case.
- The `space complexity` is also ***O(1)*** because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```typescript
function getSum(a: number, b: number): number {
    while(b !== 0) {
        let carry = a & b;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = carry << 1;
    }
    return a;
}
```
