[213. House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/)

# Intuition

This problem is a variation of the House Robber problem. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, we have two choices:

1. Rob the first house and ignore the last house.
2. Ignore the first house and rob the last house.

We can use the approach from the House Robber problem for each of these choices and return the maximum of the two.

# Approach

1. If there is only one house, return the money in that house.
2. Use dynamic programming to solve the problem for the two cases described above:
   - Rob the first house and ignore the last house.
   - Ignore the first house and rob the last house.
3. Return the maximum of the two solutions.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code

```typescript
function rob(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    if (n === 1) return nums[0];
    
    return Math.max(robRange(nums, 0, n - 2), robRange(nums, 1, n - 1));
}

function robRange(nums: number[], start: number, end: number): number {
    let prev = 0;
    let curr = 0;
    
    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
        const temp = Math.max(curr, prev + nums[i]);
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }
    
    return curr;
};
