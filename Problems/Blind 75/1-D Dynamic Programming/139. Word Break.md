[139. Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether the substring `s[0...i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

# Approach

1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Initialize `dp[0] = true`.
2. Iterate through the string `s` from index `1` to `n`:
   - For each index `i`, iterate through all words in the dictionary:
     - If `dp[j]` is `true`, where `j` is the starting index of the word and `i` is the ending index, and the substring `s[j...i-1]` is equal to the current word, set `dp[i] = true`.
3. Return `dp[n]`, which represents whether the entire string `s` can be segmented into words from the dictionary.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n â‹… m)***, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the number of words in the dictionary.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code

```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): boolean {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp: boolean[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let word of wordDict) {
            if (word.length <= i && dp[i - word.length] && s.substring(i - word.length, i) === word) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};
