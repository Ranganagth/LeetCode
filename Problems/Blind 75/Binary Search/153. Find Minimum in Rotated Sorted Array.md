[Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
We are given an array `nums` of unique elements that is sorted and rotated between 1 and `n` times. We need to find the minimum element of this array.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [3,4,5,1,2]`, the output is `1`.
- For `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`, the output is `0`.
- For `nums = [11,13,15,17]`, the output is `11`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between 1 and `n` times.

# Approach
Since the array is sorted, we can use a modified binary search to find the minimum element. We look for a pivot point, where the next element is smaller than the current element. This indicates that the array is rotated at that point, and the element after the pivot is the minimum element. We search for the pivot using a binary search algorithm.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** The time complexity of binary search is ***O(log n)***.
- **Space complexity:** The space complexity is ***O(1)***, as we are not using any extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function findMin(nums: number[]): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return nums[left];
};

```

# Explanation
We use a modified binary search to find the minimum element in the rotated sorted array.

We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. We iteratively check the middle element of the array. If `nums[mid] < nums[right]`, we move the `right` pointer to `mid`, as the minimum element must be in the left half of the array. Otherwise, we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`. We continue this process until the `left` pointer is equal to the `right` pointer, and then we return the element at that index as the minimum element.
