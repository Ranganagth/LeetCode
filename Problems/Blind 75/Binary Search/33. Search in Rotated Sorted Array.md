[Search in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
We are given an array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values). The array is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` such that the resulting array is in the format `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]`.

We need to find the index of the `target` element in the array `nums` after rotation. If the `target` is not in `nums`, we should return `-1`.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` and `target = 0`, the output is `4`.
- For `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` and `target = 3`, the output is `-1`.
- For `nums = [1]` and `target = 0`, the output is `-1`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All values of `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

# Approach
We can use a modified binary search to find the index of the `target` element in the rotated sorted array.

1. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the first and last indices of the array `nums`, respectively.
2. We iteratively find the middle element of the array.
3. We check if the `target` is equal to the middle element. If it is, we return the index of the middle element.
4. Otherwise, we check if the left half of the array is sorted and if the `target` is within the range of the left half. If it is, we update the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
5. If the left half is not sorted or if the `target` is not within the range of the left half, we update the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
6. We continue this process until the `left` pointer is greater than the `right` pointer or until we find the `target` element.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of binary search is ***O(log n).***

# Code

```typescript
function search(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        }
        
        if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
            if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        } else {
            if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};

```

# Explanation
We use a modified binary search to find the index of the `target` element in the rotated sorted array `nums`.

We maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, initialized to the first and last indices of the array, respectively. We iteratively find the middle element of the array using `mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2)`.

We check if `nums[mid] === target`. If it is, we return `mid`.

Otherwise, we check if the left half of the array is sorted. If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, then the left half of the array is sorted.

- If `target` is within the range of the left half (`nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]`), we update `right = mid - 1`.
- Otherwise, we update `left = mid + 1`.

If the left half is not sorted, then the right half of the array must be sorted. We check if `target` is within the range of the right half (`nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`).

- If it is, we update `left = mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, we update `right = mid - 1`.

We continue this process until `left > right` or until we find the `target` element. If we do not find the `target` element, we return `-1`.
