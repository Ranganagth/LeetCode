[1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1[0...i-1]` and `text2[0...j-1]`.

# Approach

1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` is the length of `text1` and `n` is the length of `text2`.
2. Initialize the first row and the first column of `dp` to `0`.
3. Iterate through the characters of `text1` and `text2`:
   - If `text1[i-1]` is equal to `text2[j-1]`, update `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, update `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`.
4. Return `dp[m][n]`, which represents the length of the longest common subsequence.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(m × n)***
- Space complexity: ***O(m × n)***

# Code

```typescript
function longestCommonSubsequence(text1: string, text2: string): number {
    const m = text1.length;
    const n = text2.length;
    
    const dp: number[][] = new Array(m + 1).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (text1[i - 1] === text2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n];
};
