[Longest Consecutive Sequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, we need to return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

### Examples:
- For `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`, the output is `4`.
  - The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, so its length is `4`.
- For `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`, the output is `9`.
  - The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`, so its length is `9`.

### Constraints:
- The length of the array `nums` is between `0` and `10^5`.
- Each element `nums[i]` is between `-10^9` and `10^9`.

# Approach
We can solve this problem in linear time by using a hashmap to store the lengths of consecutive sequences.

1. **Create an empty hashmap `sequenceLengths`.**
2. **Iterate through each element `num` in the array `nums`:**
   - **If `num - 1` does not exist in `sequenceLengths`, set its value to `1`.**
   - **Otherwise, set the length of the sequence containing `num` to `sequenceLengths[num] + sequenceLengths[num - 1]`.**
   - **Update the length of the sequence containing `num + sequenceLengths[num] - 1` to the same value.**
3. **Return the maximum value in the `sequenceLengths` hashmap.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the array once, and for each element, we perform constant-time operations, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Space complexity:** We use extra space for the hashmap, which requires ***O(n)*** space, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

# Code

```typescript
function longestConsecutive(nums: number[]): number {
    const sequenceLengths = new Map<number, number>();
    let maxLength = 0;
    
    for (const num of nums) {
        if (!sequenceLengths.has(num)) {
            const left = sequenceLengths.get(num - 1) || 0;
            const right = sequenceLengths.get(num + 1) || 0;
            const length = left + right + 1;
            
            sequenceLengths.set(num, length);
            sequenceLengths.set(num - left, length);
            sequenceLengths.set(num + right, length);
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
