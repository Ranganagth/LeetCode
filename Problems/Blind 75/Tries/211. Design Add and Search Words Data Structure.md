[211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/)

# Intuition
To implement a data structure that supports adding new words and searching for strings with wildcards, we can use a Trie (prefix tree). We modify the Trie to handle wildcard characters ('.') during search operations.

# Approach
- We'll create a `TrieNode` class, which represents each node in the trie.
- Each `TrieNode` will have:
  - A map to store its children nodes. The key of this map will be the characters in the inserted words.
  - A boolean flag `isEndOfWord` to mark the end of a word.
- We'll implement the `WordDictionary` class, which will use `TrieNode` to create a trie structure.
- The `WordDictionary` class will have the following methods:
  - `addWord(word: string)`: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
  - `search(word: string)`: Returns true if there is any string in the data structure that matches `word` or false otherwise. The `word` may contain '.' where dots can be matched with any letter.
- During the search operation, if we encounter a wildcard character '.', we'll recursively search all child nodes for the remaining characters in the `word`.

# Explanation
- For each inserted word, we traverse the trie starting from the root.
- For each character in the word:
  - If the current node does not have a child corresponding to the character, we create a new node and add it as a child.
  - We then move to the child node and repeat the process for the next character.
- After inserting the entire word, we mark the last node as the end of a word.
- For the `search` method, we traverse the trie similarly to insertion, but if we encounter a wildcard character '.', we recursively search all child nodes for the remaining characters in the `word`.
- If the `word` is exhausted, we check if the current node represents the end of a word.
- If the current node's children contain the next character in the `word`, we proceed to the next character.
- If the `word` contains a '.', we recursively search all child nodes for the remaining characters in the `word`.
- If any of these recursive searches return true, we return true.

# Complexity Analysis
- Let:
  - `n` be the length of the word for `addWord` and `search` operations.
- `addWord`:
  - Time complexity: `O(n)` for inserting a word into the trie.
  - Space complexity: `O(n)` for storing the word in the trie.
- `search`:
  - Time complexity: `O(26^n)` in the worst case, where `n` is the number of '.' in the `word`.
  - Space complexity: `O(n)`.

# Code
``` Typescript
class TrieNode {
    children: Map<string, TrieNode>;
    isEndOfWord: boolean;

    constructor() {
        this.children = new Map();
        this.isEndOfWord = false;
    }
}

class WordDictionary {
    root: TrieNode;

    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }

    addWord(word: string): void {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
            }
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    search(word: string): boolean {
        return this.searchRecursive(word, 0, this.root);
    }

    private searchRecursive(word: string, index: number, node: TrieNode): boolean {
        if (index === word.length) {
            return node.isEndOfWord;
        }

        const char = word[index];
        if (char === '.') {
            for (const child of node.children.values()) {
                if (this.searchRecursive(word, index + 1, child)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        } else {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                return false;
            }
            return this.searchRecursive(word, index + 1, node.children.get(char)!);
        }
    }
};
