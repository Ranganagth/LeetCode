[212. Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use a Trie data structure to efficiently search for words on the board. We'll perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on the board starting from each cell, and at each step, we'll check if the current sequence of characters forms a prefix of any word in the dictionary. If it does, we continue the DFS exploration. If we reach a word in the Trie, we add it to the result.

# Approach
1. Construct a Trie from the given list of words.
2. Define a helper function `dfs` to perform DFS traversal starting from each cell on the board.
3. In the `dfs` function:
   - Check if the current cell's character exists in the Trie.
   - If it does not, or if the cell is visited or out of bounds, return.
   - If the current cell's character exists in the Trie, move to the next cell recursively and update the current word.
   - If the current word exists in the Trie, add it to the result.
4. Iterate through each cell on the board and call the `dfs` function to find words starting from that cell.
5. Return the list of found words.

# Explanation
- We construct a Trie from the list of words provided. Trie is a tree-like data structure that allows us to efficiently store and search for words.
- We then perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from each cell on the board.
- During the DFS traversal, at each step, we check if the current sequence of characters forms a prefix of any word in the Trie. If it does, we continue the DFS exploration.
- If we reach a word in the Trie, we add it to the result.
- We use a Trie to efficiently check if a sequence of characters is a prefix of any word.
- To avoid revisiting the same cell, we mark the visited cell by changing its character to a special character ('#').
- After exploring all possible paths, we return the list of found words.

# Time Complexity
- Let:
  - `m` be the number of rows in the board,
  - `n` be the number of columns in the board,
  - `k` be the number of words in the dictionary,
  - `L` be the maximum length of a word,
- Constructing the Trie: `O(k \cdot L)`
- DFS traversal: `O(m \cdot n \cdot 4^L)`
  - `O(m \cdot n)` for visiting each cell on the board,
  - `O(4^L)` for the worst-case time complexity of searching a word in the Trie.
- Overall time complexity: `O(k \cdot L + m \cdot n \cdot 4^L)`

# Space Complexity
- Space complexity of the Trie: `O(k \cdot L)`
- Overall space complexity: `O(k \cdot L)`
