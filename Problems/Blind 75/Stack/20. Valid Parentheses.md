[Valid Parentheses - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/submissions/1247312442/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
We are given a string `s` containing only the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['`, and `']'`. We need to determine if the input string is valid, following these conditions:
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### Examples:
- For `s = "()"`, the output is `true`.
- For `s = "()[]{}"`, the output is `true`.
- For `s = "(]"`, the output is `false`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

# Approach
We can use a stack to solve this problem. We iterate through the characters of the input string `s`, and whenever we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, we pop the opening bracket from the stack and continue. If not, we return `false`. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the string `s` once, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where **n** is the length of `s`.
- **Space complexity:** We use a stack to store opening brackets, so the space complexity is ***O(n)***. 

# Code

```typescript
function isValid(s: string): boolean {
    const stack: string[] = [];
    const map: { [key: string]: string } = {
        "(": ")",
        "{": "}",
        "[": "]"
    };
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char in map) {
            stack.push(char);
        } else {
            const last = stack.pop();
            if (char !== map[last]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return stack.length === 0;
};

```

# Explanation
In this problem, we use a stack to check if the input string is valid.

We iterate through the characters of the input string `s`, and whenever we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If it does, we pop the opening bracket from the stack and continue. If not, we return `false`. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, we return `true`; otherwise, we return `false`.
