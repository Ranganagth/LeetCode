[133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

# Intuition

To clone the graph, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We start from the given node and create a new node with the same value. Then, we recursively clone all the neighbors of the current node. To avoid infinite loops, we need to keep track of the nodes we have already visited.

# Approach

1. Create a map to store the mapping between original nodes and their clones.
2. Create a function `cloneNode` to perform DFS.
3. In the `cloneNode` function:
   - Create a new node with the same value as the original node.
   - Add this new node to the map.
   - Iterate through the neighbors of the original node and recursively clone each neighbor.
   - Add the cloned neighbors to the neighbors list of the cloned node.
4. Return the clone of the given node.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(V + E)***, where ***V*** is the number of nodes (vertices) and ***E*** is the number of edges in the graph.
- Space complexity: ***O(V)***, where ***V*** is the number of nodes in the graph.

# Code

```typescript
class Node {
    val: number;
    neighbors: Node[];
    constructor(val?: number, neighbors?: Node[]) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.neighbors = (neighbors===undefined ? [] : neighbors);
    }
}

function cloneGraph(node: Node | null): Node | null {
    if (node === null) return null;
    
    const visited: Map<number, Node> = new Map();
    
    function cloneNode(originalNode: Node | null): Node | null {
        if (originalNode === null) return null;
        
        if (visited.has(originalNode.val)) {
            return visited.get(originalNode.val)!;
        }
        
        const clonedNode = new Node(originalNode.val);
        visited.set(clonedNode.val, clonedNode);
        
        for (let neighbor of originalNode.neighbors) {
            clonedNode.neighbors.push(cloneNode(neighbor));
        }
        
        return clonedNode;
    }
    
    return cloneNode(node);
};
