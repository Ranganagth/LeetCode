[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

# Intuition

This problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We can iterate through each cell in the grid. If we encounter a cell with a value of '1', we mark it as visited and recursively explore all its neighboring cells, marking them as visited as well. Each time we encounter a '1' that hasn't been visited before, we increment the island count.

# Approach

1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. If the current cell is '1' and it hasn't been visited yet, increment the island count and start DFS from this cell.
3. In the DFS function, mark the current cell as visited.
4. Recursively explore all neighboring cells in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and mark them as visited.
5. After exploring all neighboring cells, return from the DFS function.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(m \times n)***, where ***m*** is the number of rows and ***n*** is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space complexity: ***O(m \times n)***, where ***m*** is the number of rows and ***n*** is the number of columns in the grid.

# Code

```typescript
function numIslands(grid: string[][]): number {
    if (grid.length === 0) return 0;
    
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let count = 0;

    function dfs(row: number, col: number): void {
        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols || grid[row][col] === '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[row][col] = '0'; 
        
        dfs(row + 1, col); 
        dfs(row - 1, col); 
        dfs(row, col + 1); 
        dfs(row, col - 1); 
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '1') {
                count++;
                dfs(i, j);
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};
