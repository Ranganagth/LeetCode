[297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
Serialization of a binary tree is the process of converting the binary tree into a string representation that can be easily stored or transmitted. Deserialization is the process of converting this string back into a binary tree. 

We can use preorder traversal to serialize the binary tree. During the preorder traversal, we can append the value of each node to the serialization string, and use a special character (e.g., "#" or "null") to denote null nodes. 

For deserialization, we can split the serialization string into an array of node values. We then use a recursive function to construct the binary tree from the serialized array.

# Approach
## Serialization:
1. Perform a preorder traversal of the binary tree.
2. For each node, append its value to the serialization string. If the node is null, append a special character (e.g., "#") to denote null nodes.
3. Return the serialization string.

## Deserialization:
1. Split the serialization string into an array of node values.
2. Use a recursive function `deserialize` to construct the binary tree from the serialized array.
   - If the current value is a special character (e.g., "#"), return null to denote a null node.
   - Otherwise, create a new node with the current value.
   - Recursively call `deserialize` to construct the left and right subtrees.
3. Return the root of the binary tree.

# Complexity Analysis
- Serialization:
  - Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
  - Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree (space required for the serialization string).
- Deserialization:
  - Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
  - Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree (space required for the call stack during recursion).

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
    }
}

function serialize(root: TreeNode | null): string {
    const result: string[] = [];

    function preorder(node: TreeNode | null) {
        if (node === null) {
            result.push("#");
            return;
        }

        result.push(node.val.toString());
        preorder(node.left);
        preorder(node.right);
    }

    preorder(root);

    return result.join(",");
}

function deserialize(data: string): TreeNode | null {
    const values = data.split(",");
    let index = 0;

    function deserializeHelper(): TreeNode | null {
        if (index === values.length) return null;

        const value = values[index++];
        if (value === "#") return null;

        const node = new TreeNode(parseInt(value));
        node.left = deserializeHelper();
        node.right = deserializeHelper();

        return node;
    }

    return deserializeHelper();
};

> This solution serializes and deserializes a binary tree using preorder traversal. It converts the binary tree into a string representation, and then reconstructs the binary tree from the string.
