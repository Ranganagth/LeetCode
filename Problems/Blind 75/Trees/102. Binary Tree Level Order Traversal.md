[102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

# Intuition
To perform a level order traversal of a binary tree, we can use breadth-first search (BFS). We start by adding the root node to the queue. Then, we iterate through the queue, dequeue each node, and add its value to the current level's list. Next, we enqueue the left and right children of the node if they exist. We repeat this process until the queue is empty.

# Approach
1. Create an empty result array to store the level order traversal.
2. If the root is null, return the empty result array.
3. Create an empty queue and enqueue the root node.
4. Iterate over the queue until it is empty:
   - Create an empty array `levelValues` to store the values of nodes at the current level.
   - Iterate over the current queue size:
     - Dequeue a node from the queue.
     - Add the node's value to the `levelValues` array.
     - Enqueue the left and right children of the node if they exist.
   - Push the `levelValues` array to the result array.
5. Return the result array.

# Explanation of the solution
We perform a level order traversal using BFS and store the values of nodes at each level in separate arrays. Finally, we return an array containing these level arrays.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
    }
}

function levelOrder(root: TreeNode | null): number[][] {
    if (root === null) return [];
    
    const result: number[][] = [];
    const queue: TreeNode[] = [root];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelValues: number[] = [];
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            levelValues.push(node.val);
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
        
        result.push(levelValues);
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

> In this solution, `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary tree, and the function `levelOrder` returns the level order traversal of the tree as an array of arrays. We perform a level order traversal using BFS and store the values of nodes at each level in separate arrays. Finally, we return an array containing these level arrays.
