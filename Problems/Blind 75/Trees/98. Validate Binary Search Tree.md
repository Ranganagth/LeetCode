[98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

# Intuition
To determine whether a binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), we can perform an in-order traversal of the tree and check if the resulting sequence is sorted. In a valid BST, an in-order traversal will produce a sorted sequence of node values.

# Approach
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree.
2. During the traversal, keep track of the previously visited node's value.
3. If at any point, the value of the current node is less than or equal to the value of the previously visited node, the tree is not a valid BST.
4. If the traversal completes without encountering any violation, return true indicating that the tree is a valid BST.

# Explanation of the solution
We perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree, keeping track of the previously visited node's value. During traversal, if we find that the value of the current node is less than or equal to the value of the previously visited node, we return false, indicating that the tree is not a valid BST. If the traversal completes without any violation, we return true.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, due to the recursive nature of the in-order traversal.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
    }
}

function isValidBST(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    let prev: number | null = null;

    function inorderTraversal(node: TreeNode | null): boolean {
        if (node === null) return true;

        if (!inorderTraversal(node.left)) return false;

        if (prev !== null && node.val <= prev) return false;

        prev = node.val;

        return inorderTraversal(node.right);
    }

    return inorderTraversal(root);
};

> In this solution, `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary tree, and the function `isValidBST` determines whether the given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST). We perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree, keeping track of the previously visited node's value. During traversal, if we find that the value of the current node is less than or equal to the value of the previously visited node, we return false, indicating that the tree is not a valid BST. If the traversal completes without any violation, we return true.
