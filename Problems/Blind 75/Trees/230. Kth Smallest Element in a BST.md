[230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

# Intuition
To find the kth smallest value in a binary search tree (BST), we can perform an in-order traversal of the tree. As we traverse the tree in in-order, we keep track of the count of nodes visited. When the count reaches k, we return the value of the current node.

# Approach
1. Perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree.
2. Keep track of the count of nodes visited during traversal.
3. When the count reaches k, return the value of the current node.
4. If the count is less than k, continue traversing the right subtree.
5. If the count is greater than k, continue traversing the left subtree.

# Explanation of the solution
We perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree, keeping track of the count of nodes visited. When the count reaches k, we return the value of the current node. By traversing the tree in in-order, we ensure that we visit the nodes in ascending order, and thus the kth visited node will be the kth smallest value in the tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.
- Space complexity: ***O(h)***, where `h` is the height of the binary search tree.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
    }
}

function kthSmallest(root: TreeNode | null, k: number): number {
    let count = 0;
    let result = 0;

    function inorderTraversal(node: TreeNode | null) {
        if (node === null) return;

        inorderTraversal(node.left);

        count++;
        if (count === k) {
            result = node.val;
            return;
        }

        inorderTraversal(node.right);
    }

    inorderTraversal(root);

    return result;
};

```

> In this solution, `TreeNode` represents a node in the binary search tree, and the function `kthSmallest` returns the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree. We perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree, keeping track of the count of nodes visited. When the count reaches k, we return the value of the current node. By traversing the tree in in-order, we ensure that we visit the nodes in ascending order, and thus the kth visited node will be the kth smallest value in the tree.

`For the follow-up question, we can optimize by storing the count of nodes in each subtree. By doing this, we can avoid traversing the entire tree and only traverse the required subtree to find the kth smallest element.`


To optimize for the scenario where the binary search tree (BST) is modified often and we need to find the kth smallest element frequently, we can maintain additional information in each node of the tree. 

We can store the count of nodes in the left subtree of each node. This count will give us the number of nodes that are smaller than the current node. With this information, we can efficiently find the kth smallest element without having to traverse the entire tree.

Here's how we can implement this optimization:

# Intuition
1. We will modify the `TreeNode` class to include an additional field `leftCount`, which will store the count of nodes in the left subtree.
2. When inserting a new node, we will update the `leftCount` of each node while traversing down the tree.
3. To find the kth smallest element, we will perform a modified in-order traversal, taking into account the `leftCount` of each node.
4. During traversal, if the `leftCount` of the current node is equal to k - 1, we return the value of the current node.
5. If k is less than the `leftCount` of the current node, we continue the search in the left subtree.
6. Otherwise, we adjust k and continue the search in the right subtree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity for insertion: ***O(\log n)*** on average (assuming a balanced BST).
- Time complexity for finding kth smallest element: ***O(\log n)*** on average (assuming a balanced BST).
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    leftCount: number // Count of nodes in the left subtree
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null, leftCount?: number) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
        this.leftCount = (leftCount === undefined ? 0 : leftCount)
    }
}

function insert(root: TreeNode | null, val: number): TreeNode {
    if (!root) return new TreeNode(val);

    if (val < root.val) {
        root.left = insert(root.left, val);
        root.leftCount++; // Increment leftCount for the current node
    } else {
        root.right = insert(root.right, val);
    }

    return root;
}

function kthSmallest(root: TreeNode | null, k: number): number {
    let current = root;

    while (current) {
        if (current.leftCount === k - 1) return current.val;
        if (current.leftCount >= k) {
            current = current.left!;
        } else {
            k -= current.leftCount + 1;
            current = current.right!;
        }
    }

    return -1; // Return -1 if kth smallest does not exist
};

```

> With this optimization, when the BST is modified (through insertions or deletions), we only need to update the `leftCount` values of the affected nodes. This allows us to find the kth smallest element efficiently without having to traverse the entire tree.
