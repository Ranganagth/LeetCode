[124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/)

# Intuition
To find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path in a binary tree, we can follow these steps:
1. Define a recursive function `maxPathSumRecursive` to find the maximum path sum starting from the current node.
2. At each node, we have four options:
   - We can continue the path from the current node itself.
   - We can include the current node and continue the path from either its left subtree or its right subtree.
   - We can include the current node and continue the path from its left subtree to its right subtree.
3. Return the maximum path sum among these four options.
4. Update a global variable `maxSum` to keep track of the maximum path sum found during the traversal.

# Approach
1. Initialize a global variable `maxSum` to store the maximum path sum.
2. Implement a recursive function `maxPathSumRecursive` that takes a node as input and returns the maximum path sum starting from that node.
3. In the recursive function:
   - If the node is null, return 0.
   - Recursively calculate the maximum path sum starting from the left subtree and the right subtree.
   - Calculate the maximum path sum passing through the current node.
   - Update the global `maxSum` with the maximum path sum found so far.
   - Return the maximum path sum starting from the current node.
4. Call the `maxPathSumRecursive` function with the root of the binary tree.
5. Return the value of the global variable `maxSum`.

# Explanation of the solution
We use a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path. At each node, we calculate the maximum path sum starting from that node and update the global variable `maxSum` with the maximum path sum found so far. Finally, we return the value of `maxSum`.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space complexity: ***O(h)***, where `h` is the height of the binary tree.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number
    left: TreeNode | null
    right: TreeNode | null
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val)
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left)
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right)
    }
}

let maxSum: number;

function maxPathSum(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    maxSum = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
    maxPathSumRecursive(root);
    return maxSum;
}

function maxPathSumRecursive(node: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (node === null) return 0;

    const leftSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(node.left));
    const rightSum = Math.max(0, maxPathSumRecursive(node.right));

    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, node.val + leftSum + rightSum);

    return node.val + Math.max(leftSum, rightSum);
};

```

> This solution calculates the maximum path sum of any non-empty path in a binary tree. It uses a recursive approach to traverse the binary tree and find the maximum path sum starting from each node. At each node, it calculates the maximum path sum passing through that node and updates the global variable `maxSum` with the maximum path sum found so far. Finally, it returns the value of `maxSum`.
