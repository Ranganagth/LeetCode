[Same Tree - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/)

# Intuition
To check if two binary trees are the same, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We'll traverse both trees simultaneously and compare their corresponding nodes.

# Approach
1. If both trees are null, return true.
2. If one of the trees is null and the other is not, return false.
3. If the values of the current nodes of the two trees are not equal, return false.
4. Recursively check if the left subtree of tree p is the same as the left subtree of tree q.
5. Recursively check if the right subtree of tree p is the same as the right subtree of tree q.
6. Return true if all the conditions are met.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
- Space complexity: ***O(h)***, where ***h*** is the height of the binary tree (in the worst case, if the binary tree is skewed).

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
        this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
    }
}

function isSameTree(p: TreeNode | null, q: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!p && !q) return true;
    if (!p || !q) return false;
    if (p.val !== q.val) return false;
    return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
};
