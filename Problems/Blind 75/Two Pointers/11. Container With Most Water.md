[Container With Most Water - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)


# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given an integer array `height` of length `n`, representing vertical lines, we need to find two lines that, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container contains the most water. We have to return the maximum amount of water that the container can store.

### Examples:
- For `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`, the output is `49`.
  - The maximum area of water the container can contain is shown by the blue section in the image below.

  ```
  7 |                   __
  6 |         __       |  |
  5 |      __|  |__    |  |     __
  4 |     |  |  |  |   |  |  __|  |
  3 |  __ |  |  |  |__ |  |__|  |  |
  2 |  |__|  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |
  1 |__|__|__|__|__|__||__|__|__|__|_
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
  ```
- For `height = [1,1]`, the output is `1`.
  - There is only one vertical line, so the maximum area is `1`.

### Constraints:
- `n` is between `2` and `10^5`.
- Each element `height[i]` is between `0` and `10^4`.

# Approach
We can solve this problem using the two-pointer approach.

1. **Initialize two pointers, `left` at `0` and `right` at `n - 1`.**
2. **Use the following conditions to determine the next move:**
   - **If `height[left] < height[right]`, calculate the current area with `height[left]` and move `left` towards the right.**
   - **If `height[left] >= height[right]`, calculate the current area with `height[right]` and move `right` towards the left.**
3. **Keep track of the maximum area and return it as the result.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the array once with two pointers, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the array `height`.
- **Space complexity:** We only use a constant amount of extra space, so the space complexity is ***O(1)***.

# Code

```typescript
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
    let maxArea = 0;
    let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        const h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        const w = right - left;
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * w);
        
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    return maxArea;
};

```

> *Note*: In this problem, we use the two-pointer approach to find the maximum area. We start with the widest container, then gradually decrease the width while ensuring that we're not sacrificing height.
