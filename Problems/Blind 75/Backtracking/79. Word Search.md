[79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We'll start from each cell on the board and try to construct the word using adjacent cells.

# Approach
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell, start the DFS search to find the word.
3. In the DFS search:
   - If the current character in the word does not match the character in the current cell, return false.
   - Mark the current cell as visited.
   - Recursively explore neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) to find the next character in the word.
   - If the entire word is found, return true.
   - Backtrack by unmarking the current cell as visited.
4. If no path is found for any cell, return false.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(m * n * 4^l), where m is the number of rows, n is the number of columns, and l is the length of the word.
  - We iterate through each cell in the grid (m * n).
  - For each cell, we explore up to 4 neighboring cells in the worst case.
  - The depth of the DFS recursion can be up to the length of the word (l).
- Space complexity: O(l), where l is the length of the word (space required for the call stack during recursion).

# Code

```typescript
function exist(board: string[][], word: string): boolean {
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;
    const directions = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]];

    function dfs(row: number, col: number, index: number): boolean {
        if (index === word.length) return true;

        if (
            row < 0 || row >= rows ||
            col < 0 || col >= cols ||
            board[row][col] !== word[index]
        ) {
            return false;
        }

        const temp = board[row][col];
        board[row][col] = "#";

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            if (dfs(row + dx, col + dy, index + 1)) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        board[row][col] = temp;

        return false;
    }

    for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
            // Start the DFS search from each cell
            if (dfs(row, col, 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
};

> This solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find if a word exists in the grid. It explores all possible paths starting from each cell until it finds a path that matches the word.
