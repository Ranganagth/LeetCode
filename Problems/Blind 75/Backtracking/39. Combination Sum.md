[39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

# Intuition
To find all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target, we can use backtracking. We will explore all possible combinations by recursively trying out different candidates at each step.

# Approach
1. Sort the candidates array to ensure that we can easily skip over candidates greater than the target during backtracking.
2. Define a recursive function `backtrack` that takes the current combination, the current sum, and the index of the candidate we are currently considering.
3. If the current sum is equal to the target, add the current combination to the result.
4. If the current sum exceeds the target or we have reached the end of the candidates array, return.
5. Otherwise, for each candidate starting from the current index, add it to the current combination and recursively call the `backtrack` function with the updated combination, sum, and index.
6. Remove the last element from the combination to backtrack.

# Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is exponential as we are exploring all possible combinations. However, the actual time complexity will be much less in practice because we are pruning the search space by skipping over candidates greater than the target.

# Code

```typescript
function combinationSum(candidates: number[], target: number): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    candidates.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    function backtrack(start: number, sum: number, combination: number[]) {
        if (sum === target) {
            result.push([...combination]);
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (sum + candidates[i] > target) break;
            combination.push(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(i, sum + candidates[i], combination);
            combination.pop();
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, 0, []);

    return result;
};

```

> This solution finds all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target using backtracking. It sorts the candidates array first to easily skip over candidates greater than the target during backtracking.
