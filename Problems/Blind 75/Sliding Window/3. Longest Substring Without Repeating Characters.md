[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given a string `s`, we need to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Examples:
- For `s = "abcabcbb"`, the output is `3`.
  - The longest substring without repeating characters is `"abc"`, with a length of `3`.
- For `s = "bbbbb"`, the output is `1`.
  - The longest substring without repeating characters is `"b"`, with a length of `1`.
- For `s = "pwwkew"`, the output is `3`.
  - The longest substring without repeating characters is `"wke"`, with a length of `3`.

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`.
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.

# Approach

1. **Initialize a set `seen` to keep track of characters we have seen so far.**
2. **Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the window.**
3. **While the `right` pointer is less than the length of the string:**
   - **If `s[right]` is not in the `seen` set:**
     - **Add `s[right]` to the `seen` set.**
     - **Increment `right`.**
     - **Update the maximum length if necessary.**
   - **Otherwise:**
     - **Remove `s[left]` from the `seen` set.**
     - **Increment `left`.**
4. **Return the maximum length found.**

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:** We traverse the string once with two pointers, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space complexity:** We use a set to keep track of seen characters, so the space complexity is ***O(min(n, k))***, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the size of the character set.

# Code

```typescript
function lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
    let maxLen = 0;
    let left = 0, right = 0;
    const seen = new Set<string>();
    
    while (right < s.length) {
        if (!seen.has(s[right])) {
            seen.add(s[right]);
            right++;
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left);
        } else {
            seen.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLen;
};
```

# Explanation
In this problem, we use the sliding window technique to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. We maintain a set (`seen`) to keep track of characters we have seen so far. We use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define the window. As we traverse the string with the `right` pointer, we add characters to the `seen` set and update the maximum length if necessary. If we encounter a repeating character, we move the `left` pointer and remove characters from the `seen` set until we no longer have a repeating character in the window. Finally, we return the maximum length found.
