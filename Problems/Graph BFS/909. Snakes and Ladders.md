[909. Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we can model it as a shortest path problem on an unweighted graph where each square on the board represents a node. The BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm is suitable for this type of problem since it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found.

# Approach
1. Flatten the 2D board into a 1D array to simplify the traversal. This involves carefully handling the Boustrophedon style where rows alternate in direction.
2. Use BFS to explore the board:
   - Start from square 1.
   - For each square, calculate the possible next squares by simulating the roll of a 6-sided die.
   - If a square has a ladder or snake, move to its destination.
   - Track visited squares to avoid reprocessing them.
   - Count the number of moves taken to reach the final square.
3. If the BFS completes without reaching the final square, return -1 indicating it's impossible to reach the end.

# Explanation
1. **Flattening the Board**: Convert the 2D Boustrophedon board to a 1D array to simplify indexing. This requires alternating row direction to match the board's labeling.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from square 1, use a queue to explore all reachable squares within a roll range of 1-6. Move to the destination of ladders or snakes immediately.
3. **Tracking Moves**: Each level of BFS represents one move. Track the number of moves until the final square is reached.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The BFS algorithm processes each square once, and for each square, it considers up to 6 possible moves. Thus, the time complexity is ***O(n²)***, where n is the dimension of the board.
  
- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(n²)*** for storing the visited nodes and the queue.

# Code
```TypeScript
function snakesAndLadders(board: number[][]): number {
    const n = board.length;
    const flatten = (pos: number): [number, number] => {
        const row = Math.floor((pos - 1) / n);
        const col = (pos - 1) % n;
        if (row % 2 === 0) {
            return [n - 1 - row, col];
        } else {
            return [n - 1 - row, n - 1 - col];
        }
    };

    const queue: [number, number][] = [[1, 0]];
    const visited = new Set<number>();

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [current, moves] = queue.shift()!;
        if (current === n * n) {
            return moves;
        }

        for (let i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            let next = current + i;
            if (next > n * n) break;

            const [row, col] = flatten(next);
            if (board[row][col] !== -1) {
                next = board[row][col];
            }

            if (!visited.has(next)) {
                visited.add(next);
                queue.push([next, moves + 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
};
