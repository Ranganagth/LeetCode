[70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)


# Intuition

The problem of climbing stairs with either 1 or 2 steps at a time is a classic dynamic programming problem. It can be thought of as a variation of the Fibonacci sequence. To reach the `n`-th step, you can either come from the `(n-1)`-th step or the `(n-2)`-th step.

# Approach

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If there's only 1 step, there's only one way to climb it.
   - If there are 2 steps, there are two ways to climb: (1 step + 1 step) or (2 steps).

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
   - Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach step `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 2.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each step from 3 to `n`, the number of ways to reach that step is the sum of the ways to reach the previous step (`dp[i-1]`) and the step before the previous step (`dp[i-2]`).

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The value in `dp[n]` will be the total number of ways to reach the `n`-th step.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we need to compute the values for each step up to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the values in the DP array.

# Code
```typescript
function climbStairs(n: number): number {
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    const dp: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;
    for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
    }
    return dp[n];
};
