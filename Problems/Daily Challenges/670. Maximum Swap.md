[670. Maximum Swap](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-swap/)

# Intuition:

We are given an integer `num` and we are allowed to swap two digits at most once to form the maximum possible value of the number. The task is to return the maximum number after performing this swap.

# Approach:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Convert the number into an array of digits for easier manipulation.
   - We need to identify the best possible swap that can produce the maximum number.

2. **Optimal Swap**:
   - To maximize the number, we should swap a smaller digit from the left with a larger digit that appears later in the number.
   - The key idea is:
     - Find the largest possible digit that can be swapped to an earlier position in the number.
     - Perform the swap between the first smaller digit (starting from the left) and the largest possible digit that appears later.

3. **Steps**:
   - Convert the number to a string and then to an array of characters.
   - Traverse the number from left to right while keeping track of the largest digit seen so far.
   - If thereâ€™s a digit later in the number that is larger than the current digit, swap them.
   - Return the maximum number formed after the swap, or return the original number if no swap improves the value.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the number is already the maximum possible value (i.e., digits are in non-increasing order), no swap is necessary.
   - If all digits are the same, no swap will change the number.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of digits in the number (since we only traverse the digits a few times).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, due to the array used to store the digits.

# Code:

```typescript
function maximumSwap(num: number): number {
    const digits = num.toString().split('');
    
    const lastIndex = Array(10).fill(-1);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
        lastIndex[parseInt(digits[i])] = i;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < digits.length; i++) {
        for (let d = 9; d > parseInt(digits[i]); d--) {
            if (lastIndex[d] > i) {
                [digits[i], digits[lastIndex[d]]] = [digits[lastIndex[d]], digits[i]];
                
              return parseInt(digits.join(''));
            }
        }
    }
    
    return num;
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Convert to Array**:
   - First, we convert the number into an array of digits to easily manipulate and check the digits.

2. **Track Last Positions**:
   - We maintain an array `lastIndex` where each element holds the last occurrence of a digit in the number. This helps us quickly determine if a larger digit exists later in the number that can be swapped.

3. **Find Optimal Swap**:
   - For each digit (from left to right), we check if there's a larger digit that appears later in the number by consulting `lastIndex`. If such a digit exists, we swap the current digit with that larger digit.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After performing the swap (if possible), we join the digits back into a number and return the result.
   - If no swap improves the number, the original number is returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `num = 2736`

- Convert `2736` to `['2', '7', '3', '6']`.
- Create `lastIndex`: For each digit from 0 to 9, track the last occurrence:
  - `lastIndex = [-1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 3, 1, -1, -1]`.
  - This tells us that the last occurrence of '7' is at index 1, and '6' is at index 3, etc.
  
- Start from the left (index 0, '2'):
  - Check if there's a larger digit (starting from 9 down to '2') that appears later in the array.
  - We find that '7' at index 1 is larger than '2'. We swap them, resulting in `['7', '2', '3', '6']`.

- Convert `['7', '2', '3', '6']` back to a number: **7236**.

**Output**: `7236`.

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `num = 9973`

- Convert `9973` to `['9', '9', '7', '3']`.
- Create `lastIndex`: For each digit from 0 to 9, track the last occurrence:
  - `lastIndex = [-1, -1, -1, 3, -1, -1, -1, 2, -1, 1]`.
  
- Start from the left (index 0, '9'):
  - No larger digit appears later in the array, so no swap is needed.

**Output**: `9973`.

### Conclusion:

This approach ensures that we can find the optimal swap in a single pass through the digits and a constant time lookup for each digit. This makes it efficient for a number with up to **10^8** (8 digits), as required by the problem constraints.
