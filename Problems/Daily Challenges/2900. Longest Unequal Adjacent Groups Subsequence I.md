[2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/)

# Intuition

The task is to find the longest subsequence from `words` such that consecutive elements have alternating bits in the `groups` array. This means we need to keep switching between `0` and `1` as we move along the subsequence.

The problem resembles the "Longest Alternating Subsequence" pattern, where we look for changes in the `groups` array and collect the corresponding `words` elements.

# Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   * Start with the first element as part of the subsequence.
   * Track the current `group` value.

2. **Traverse the List:**
   * Loop through each element in `groups` from the second element.
   * If the current group's value is different from the previous one:
     * Add the corresponding word to the subsequence.
     * Update the `currentGroup` to the new group.

3. **End of Loop:**
   * The constructed subsequence is the longest alternating subsequence.

4. **Return the Subsequence:**
   * Output the list of words collected during traversal.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — Single pass through the list.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — For storing the subsequence.

Given the constraint `n <= 100`, the solution is optimal.

# Code

```typescript
function getLongestSubsequence(words: string[], groups: number[]): string[] {
    const n = words.length;
    if (n === 0) return [];

    // Start with the first word and group
    const subsequence: string[] = [words[0]];
    let currentGroup = groups[0];

    // Traverse the groups array
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // If the group is different, it can be part of the subsequence
        if (groups[i] !== currentGroup) {
            subsequence.push(words[i]);
            currentGroup = groups[i]; // Update the current group
        }
    }

    return subsequence;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: words = ["e","a","b"], groups = [0,0,1]

Step-by-step:
- Start with "e" (group 0)
- "a" is skipped (same group as previous)
- "b" is added (group changes to 1)

Final subsequence: ["e", "b"]
Output: ["e", "b"]
```

---

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","c","d"], groups = [1,0,1,1]

Step-by-step:
- Start with "a" (group 1)
- "b" is added (group changes to 0)
- "c" is added (group changes to 1)
- "d" is skipped (same group as previous)

Final subsequence: ["a", "b", "c"]
Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

### **Edge Cases Handled:**

1. If `words` and `groups` are empty, the function correctly returns `[]`.
2. If all groups are the same, only the first element is returned since no alternating happens.
