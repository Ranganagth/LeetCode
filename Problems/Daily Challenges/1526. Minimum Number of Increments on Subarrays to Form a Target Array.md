[1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-increments-on-subarrays-to-form-a-target-array/)

# Intuition

We start with an array of all zeros and want to reach the `target` array.
Each operation lets us **increment all elements in a subarray by 1**.

### Observation:

* If we move from **left to right**, every time the value **increases** compared to the previous value, we need **extra operations** to raise it.
* If it decreases, we don’t need extra operations — because decrements are not possible, so the previous operations already covered it.

Essentially:

* Only the **positive difference between adjacent elements** contributes to additional operations.

### Example Intuition

Let’s see an example:

```
target = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
```

We start from `[0,0,0,0,0]`

* From 0 → 1: need 1 operation (raise everything to 1)
* From 1 → 2: need 1 more operation (raise middle subarray)
* From 2 → 3: need 1 more operation (raise center)
* From 3 → 2: decrease, no extra operation
* From 2 → 1: decrease, no extra operation

Total = 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**

### Key Formula

We can generalize this:

```
operations = target[0] + Σ(max(0, target[i] - target[i - 1])) for i = 1 to n-1
```

Why?

* `target[0]`: because we must lift the first element from 0 to its value.
* Each positive jump means we need that many additional operations.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize `operations = target[0]`
2. For each `i` from 1 to n-1:

   * If `target[i] > target[i-1]`, add the difference to `operations`
3. Return `operations`

---

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

# Code

```typescript
function minNumberOperations(target: number[]): number {
  let operations = target[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {
    if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
      operations += target[i] - target[i - 1];
    }
  }

  return operations;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1:

**Input:** `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`

| i | target[i-1] | target[i] | Diff | Add | Total |
| - | ----------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| 0 | -           | 1         | -    | 1   | 1     |
| 1 | 1           | 2         | +1   | +1  | 2     |
| 2 | 2           | 3         | +1   | +1  | 3     |
| 3 | 3           | 2         | -1   | 0   | 3     |
| 4 | 2           | 1         | -1   | 0   | 3     |

Output = **3**

### Example 2:

**Input:** `[3, 1, 1, 2]`

| i | target[i-1] | target[i] | Diff | Add | Total |
| - | ----------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| 0 | -           | 3         | -    | 3   | 3     |
| 1 | 3           | 1         | -2   | 0   | 3     |
| 2 | 1           | 1         | 0    | 0   | 3     |
| 3 | 1           | 2         | +1   | +1  | 4     |

Output = **4**

### Example 3:

**Input:** `[3,1,5,4,2]`

| i | target[i-1] | target[i] | Diff | Add | Total |
| - | ----------- | --------- | ---- | --- | ----- |
| 0 | -           | 3         | -    | 3   | 3     |
| 1 | 3           | 1         | -2   | 0   | 3     |
| 2 | 1           | 5         | +4   | +4  | 7     |
| 3 | 5           | 4         | -1   | 0   | 7     |
| 4 | 4           | 2         | -2   | 0   | 7     |

Output = **7**
