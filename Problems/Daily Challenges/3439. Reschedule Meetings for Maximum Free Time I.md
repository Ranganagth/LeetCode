[3439. Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-i/)

### Problem Summary

You are given:

* `eventTime`: total time for an event (e.g., 0 to eventTime).
* Arrays `startTime[]` and `endTime[]`: existing **non-overlapping meetings** (sorted by time).
* You can **reschedule up to `k` meetings** (keep their durations and order, but shift their start time).
* Objective: **maximize the longest free period** after moving at most `k` meetings.

---

# Intuition

To **maximize free time**, we want to **compress `k` consecutive meetings** together in a block and **move** them to another location (e.g., to the beginning or end), creating the largest possible gap between other meetings.

Let’s say we shift `k` consecutive meetings and calculate the **gap (free time)** that opens up due to their shift.

To do this efficiently:

* Use **prefix sums** to calculate **total duration** of any group of `k` consecutive meetings.
* Then check the **available window** outside that group.

---

# Approach (Sliding Window + Prefix Sum)

1. Compute prefix sum of total meeting durations.
2. Try all possible windows of size `k` (i.e., from `i - k + 1` to `i`).
3. After virtually shifting those meetings, compute:

   * `left`: where the group starts
   * `right`: where the next meeting starts
   * Free time created = `(right - left) - duration of the k meetings`
4. Track the **maximum such free time** over all windows.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **O(n)** time:

  * One pass for prefix sum
  * One pass to check all windows of size `k`
* **O(n)** space for prefix sum array

---

# Code

```ts
function maxFreeTime(
    eventTime: number,
    k: number,
    startTime: number[],
    endTime: number[],
): number {
    const n = startTime.length;
    const sum: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Compute prefix sum of durations
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        sum[i + 1] = sum[i] + (endTime[i] - startTime[i]);
    }

    let maxFree = 0;

    // Try every group of k consecutive meetings
    for (let i = k - 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Determine window: meetings i-k+1 to i
        const duration = sum[i + 1] - sum[i - k + 1];

        const left = (i === k - 1) ? 0 : endTime[i - k]; // end of previous meeting
        const right = (i === n - 1) ? eventTime : startTime[i + 1]; // start of next meeting

        const freeTime = (right - left) - duration;
        maxFree = Math.max(maxFree, freeTime);
    }

    return maxFree;
}
```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:

```ts
eventTime = 10
k = 1
startTime = [0,2,9]
endTime =   [1,4,10]
```

#### Visualize:

Meetings:

* [0,1]
* [2,4]
* [9,10]

Try rescheduling each individual meeting:

1. Move meeting [0,1] → opens up [1,2] (small)
2. Move [2,4] → opens up [4,9] → gap = 5
3. Move [9,10] → opens up [4,9] → gap = 5

**Max free time = 6**

---

### **Summary**

* Use a **sliding window of `k` meetings**, check where removing/rescheduling creates largest free segment.
* Fast and efficient using **prefix sum** and **math**.
* Solves up to **100,000** meetings efficiently in **O(n)**.
