[1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box/)

# Intuition

The problem involves calculating the minimum number of operations required to move all balls to each box. Since moving a ball incurs a cost proportional to the distance, we need an efficient way to compute the total cost for all balls to reach a specific box.

Instead of recalculating distances for every box in a naive manner **O(nÂ²)**, we can optimize using a **prefix sum approach**:
1. Calculate the cumulative operations while moving from left to right across the string.
2. Calculate the cumulative operations while moving from right to left.
3. Combine these results to get the total cost for each box.

This approach leverages the idea that the operations for each box depend on the cumulative movement of balls in the previous boxes.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - Create an output array `answer` of size *n*, initialized to 0.
    - Use two passes: left-to-right and right-to-left, to calculate the cumulative cost of moving balls.
	
2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
    - Start from the leftmost box and calculate the cumulative number of operations required to move all balls to each box. Track the number of balls encountered so far and their contribution to the total cost.
	
3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
    - Start from the rightmost box and repeat the calculation for the right-to-left direction. Update the `answer` array by adding the results from this pass.
	
4. **Combine Results**:    
    - After both passes, the `answer` array contains the total operations required to move all balls to each box.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Left-to-right pass: **O(n)**.
    - Right-to-left pass: **O(n)**.
    - Total: ***O(n)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - ***O(n)*** for the `answer` array.

# Code

```typescript
function minOperations(boxes: string): number[] {
    const n = boxes.length;
    const answer = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Left-to-right pass
    let count = 0; // Number of balls encountered so far
    let operations = 0; // Cumulative operations
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        answer[i] += operations;
        count += boxes[i] === '1' ? 1 : 0;
        operations += count;
    }

    // Right-to-left pass
    count = 0;
    operations = 0;
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        answer[i] += operations;
        count += boxes[i] === '1' ? 1 : 0;
        operations += count;
    }

    return answer;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const boxes = "110";
console.log(minOperations(boxes)); // Output: [1,1,3]
```

**Execution**:

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - `answer = [0, 0, 0]`.
	
2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
    - *i = 0*: `answer[0] = 0`, count = 1, operations = 1.
    - *i = 1*: `answer[1] = 1`, count = 2, operations = 3.
    - *i = 2*: `answer[2] = 3`.
	
3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
    - *i = 2*: `answer[2] = 3`, count = 1, operations = 1.
    - *i = 1*: `answer[1] = 1 + 1 = 2`, count = 2, operations = 3.
    - *i = 0*: `answer[0] = 0 + 3 = 1`.

**Output**:

```typescript
[1, 1, 3]
```

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const boxes = "001011";
console.log(minOperations(boxes)); // Output: [11, 8, 5, 4, 3, 4]
```

**Execution**:

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - `answer = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
	
2. **Left-to-Right Pass**:
    - *i = 0*: `answer[0] = 0`, count = 0, operations = 0.
    - *i = 1*: `answer[1] = 0`.
    - *i = 2*: `answer[2] = 0`, count = 1, operations = 1.
    - *i = 3*: `answer[3] = 1`, count = 2, operations = 3.
    - *i = 4*: `answer[4] = 3`, count = 3, operations = 6.
    - *i = 5*: `answer[5] = 6`.
	
3. **Right-to-Left Pass**:
    - *i = 5*: `answer[5] = 6`, count = 1, operations = 1.
    - *i = 4*: `answer[4] = 3 + 1 = 4`, count = 2, operations = 3.
    - *i = 3*: `answer[3] = 1 + 3 = 4`, count = 3, operations = 6.
    - *i = 2*: `answer[2] = 0 + 6 = 5`, count = 4, operations = 10.
    - *i = 1*: `answer[1] = 0 + 10 = 8`, count = 5, operations = 15.
    - *i = 0*: `answer[0] = 0 + 15 = 11`.

**Output**:

```typescript
[11, 8, 5, 4, 3, 4]
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Ball**:
    - Input: `boxes = "10000"`.
    - Output: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (The ball shifts to the right).
	
2. **All Boxes Empty**:
    - Input: `boxes = "00000"`.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
	
3. **All Boxes Full**:
    - Input: `boxes = "11111"`.
    - Output: `[10, 7, 6, 7, 10]`.
