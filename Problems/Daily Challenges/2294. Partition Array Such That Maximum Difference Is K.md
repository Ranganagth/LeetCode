[2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-such-that-maximum-difference-is-k/)

### Problem: Minimum Subsequences with Bounded Difference

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. You must partition the array into **one or more subsequences** such that **each number appears in exactly one subsequence**, and in each subsequence the **difference between the maximum and minimum** values is at most `k`.

You must **minimize the number of such subsequences**.

---

# Intuition

If we sort the array, then the problem becomes easier:

- After sorting, the elements in increasing order will be easier to group.
- You can iterate from left to right and keep adding elements to the current subsequence **as long as the difference between the current element and the starting element is ≤ k**.    
- Once that difference exceeds `k`, you start a new subsequence.

This greedy approach guarantees the **minimum number of subsequences**.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort** the array in non-decreasing order.
    
2. Initialize `count = 0` to keep track of how many subsequences are created.
    
3. Loop through the sorted array using an index `i`.
    - Mark the start of a new subsequence at index `i`.
    - Move index `j` forward until `nums[j] - nums[i] > k`.
    - This gives one valid subsequence from `i` to `j - 1`.    
    - Increment `count`, and set `i = j` to start the next subsequence.
    
4. Return `count`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting, and `O(n)` for the iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (not counting the input sort space if done in-place).

# Code

```ts
function partitionArray(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Step 1: sort
    let count = 0;
    let i = 0;
    const n = nums.length;

    while (i < n) {
        let start = nums[i];
        count++; // Start a new subsequence
        i++;
        while (i < n && nums[i] - start <= k) {
            i++; // Add to current subsequence
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [3,6,1,2,5], k = 2`  
**Sorted**: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`

- Start at 1 → can take 2, 3 → next is 5 (> 3+2), so end subsequence → `count = 1`
- Start at 5 → can take 6 → `count = 2`
    

**Output**: `2`

#### Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [1,2,3], k = 1`  
**Sorted**: `[1,2,3]`

- Start at 1 → can take 2 → next is 3 (diff > 1) → end subsequence → `count = 1`
- Start at 3 → `count = 2`
    

**Output**: `2`

---

### **Summary**

- Sort the array
- Greedily form subsequences from left to right
- Ensure each subsequence’s max - min ≤ k
- Count how many such groups are needed
