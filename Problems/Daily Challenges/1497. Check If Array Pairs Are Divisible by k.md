[1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-pairs-are-divisible-by-k/)

# Intuition:

The task requires us to determine whether we can pair up all the elements of the array such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`. 

To achieve this, we need to understand the role of the remainders when dividing by `k`:
- For a pair `(a, b)` to have a sum divisible by `k`, their remainders when divided by `k` must satisfy the condition `(a % k + b % k) % k == 0`. 
- Specifically:
  - If an element has a remainder `r`, its pair must have a remainder `k - r` to make their sum divisible by `k`.
  - Elements that have a remainder of `0` must pair with other elements that also have a remainder of `0`.

# Approach:

1. **Remainder Calculation:**
   - For each element in the array, calculate its remainder when divided by `k`. Track the frequency of each remainder in a hashmap or array.

2. **Pairing Conditions:**
   - For elements with remainder `0`, they must pair with each other, so the count of such elements must be even.
   - For each remainder `r`, there should be an equal number of elements with remainder `k - r` to form valid pairs.

3. **Check Validity:**
   - If the above conditions are met for all remainders, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We only need to iterate through the array once to calculate the remainders and once more to check for valid pairs.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(k)***, since we store the frequencies of remainders, and the number of distinct remainders is bounded by `k`.

# Code:

```typescript
function canArrange(arr: number[], k: number): boolean {
    const remainderCount = new Array(k).fill(0);

    for (const num of arr) {
        const remainder = ((num % k) + k) % k;
        remainderCount[remainder]++;
    }

    if (remainderCount[0] % 2 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= Math.floor(k / 2); i++) {
        if (remainderCount[i] !== remainderCount[k - i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Remainder Calculation:**
   - For each element in the array, we compute the remainder when divided by `k`. We also ensure that the remainder is non-negative using `((num % k) + k) % k`.

2. **Handling Remainder `0`:**
   - If an element's remainder is `0`, it can only pair with another element whose remainder is also `0`. Therefore, the count of elements with remainder `0` must be even.

3. **Handling Other Remainders:**
   - For each remainder `r`, there must be an equal number of elements with remainder `k - r` to form valid pairs. This is checked for all remainders from `1` to `k/2`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `true`, meaning it's possible to pair up the elements to meet the condition. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

### Example Walkthrough:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5`
   - Remainders: `[1,2,3,4,0,0,1,2,3,4]`
   - Remainder pairs: (1, 4), (2, 3), (0, 0)
   - Output: `true` (Valid pairs: (1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 10))

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7`
   - Remainders: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   - Remainder pairs: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4)
   - Output: `true` (Valid pairs: (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4))

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10`
   - Remainders: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   - There is no way to form valid pairs.
   - Output: `false`

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently checks if itâ€™s possible to pair elements in the array such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`. The key insight is leveraging remainders and ensuring that elements can form valid pairs based on their remainders.
