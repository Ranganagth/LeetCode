[860. Lemonade Change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/)
# Intuition:
1. **Handling $5 Bills**: If a customer pays with a $5 bill, you don't need to provide any change, so simply increase the count of $5 bills.
2. **Handling $10 Bills**: If a customer pays with a $10 bill, you need to provide $5 in change. If you have a $5 bill, use one of them for the change and increase the count of $10 bills.
3. **Handling $20 Bills**: If a customer pays with a $20 bill, you need to provide $15 in change. The optimal way to give change is to use one $10 bill and one $5 bill (if possible) because it helps retain smaller denominations which might be needed later. If you donâ€™t have a $10 bill, then you must give three $5 bills as change. If you can't do either, return `false`.

# Approach:
1. Iterate through each bill in the `bills` array.
2. Depending on the value of the bill, update the count of $5 and $10 bills accordingly.
3. If at any point you can't provide the correct change, return `false`.
4. If you can provide change for all customers, return `true`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the `bills` array. We process each bill exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only need to keep track of two variables (the count of $5 and $10 bills).

# Code:

```typescript
function lemonadeChange(bills: number[]): boolean {
    let five = 0;
    let ten = 0;
    
    for (const bill of bills) {
        if (bill === 5) {
            five++;
        } else if (bill === 10) {
            if (five === 0) {
                return false;
            }
            five--;
            ten++;
        } else {
            if (ten > 0 && five > 0) {
                ten--;
                five--;
            } else if (five >= 3) {
                five -= 3;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return true;
};


```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(lemonadeChange([5, 5, 5, 10, 20])); // Output: true
console.log(lemonadeChange([5, 5, 10, 10, 20])); // Output: false
```

### Explanation:
- **$5 Bill**: Just add to the count of $5 bills since no change is required.
- **$10 Bill**: Deduct one $5 bill if available and add one $10 bill to your stash.
- **$20 Bill**: Preferably give change using one $10 bill and one $5 bill. If not possible, then try to use three $5 bills. If neither is possible, return `false`.
