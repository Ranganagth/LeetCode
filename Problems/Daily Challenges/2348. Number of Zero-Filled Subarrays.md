[2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays/)
# Intuition

We are asked to count **subarrays consisting only of zeros**.

* A subarray is contiguous.
* If we find a block (continuous segment) of zeros of length `k`, then the number of subarrays entirely filled with zeros inside this block is:

$$
\frac{k \times (k+1)}{2}
$$

Why?

* For `k = 1` → subarrays = 1
* For `k = 2` → subarrays = 3 (`[0]`, `[0]`, `[0,0]`)
* For `k = 3` → subarrays = 6 (`[0]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[0,0]`, `[0,0]`, `[0,0,0]`)
  and so on…

So, we just need to **find consecutive blocks of zeros**, compute the above formula, and sum them.

---

# Approach

1. Traverse the array.
2. Maintain a counter `count` for consecutive zeros.
3. Each time we encounter a non-zero element, calculate the contribution from the block of zeros using:

   $$
   \text{result} += \frac{count \times (count+1)}{2}
   $$

   and reset `count`.
4. After the loop, check once more for the last block (if array ends with zeros).
5. Return the total.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` → Single pass through the array.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` → Only a few variables used.

# Code

```typescript
function zeroFilledSubarray(nums: number[]): number {
    let result = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) {
            count++; // extend zero block
        } else {
            // end of zero block → add contribution
            result += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
            count = 0;
        }
    }

    // in case the array ends with a block of zeros
    result += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;

    return result;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1:

`nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]`

* First zero block: `[0,0]` → count=2
  contribution = 2 \* 3 / 2 = **3**
* Second zero block: `[0,0]` → count=2
  contribution = 2 \* 3 / 2 = **3**
* Total = 3 + 3 = **6**

Output = 6

### Example 2:

`nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]`

* First zero block: `[0,0,0]` → count=3
  contribution = 3 \* 4 / 2 = **6**
* Second zero block: `[0,0]` → count=2
  contribution = 2 \* 3 / 2 = **3**
* Total = 6 + 3 = **9**

Output = 9

### Example 3:

`nums = [2,10,2019]`

* No zeros → contribution = 0

Output = 0
