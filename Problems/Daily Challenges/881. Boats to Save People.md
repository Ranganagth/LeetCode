[Boats to Save People - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/boats-to-save-people/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-04)

# Intuition
To find the minimum number of boats required to carry every given person, we can sort the people array and use a two-pointer approach.

# Approach
1. Sort the people array in ascending order.
2. Use two pointers, one pointing to the start of the array and the other pointing to the end of the array.
3. Move the two pointers inward.
4. If the sum of the weights of the people at the two pointers is less than or equal to the limit, both people can be carried on one boat. Increment the count of boats and move both pointers.
5. If the sum of the weights exceeds the limit, only the heavier person can be carried on the boat. Increment the count of boats and move the heavier person's pointer.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the two pointers meet.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n \log n)***, where ***n*** is the number of people.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function numRescueBoats(people: number[], limit: number): number {
    people.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let boats = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = people.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        if (people[left] + people[right] <= limit) {
            left++;
            right--;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
        boats++;
    }

    return boats;
};
