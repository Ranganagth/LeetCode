[2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/keep-multiplying-found-values-by-two/)

# Intuition

The task is a linear lookup-and-update loop.
You repeatedly check whether the current value exists in the array.
If it does, double the value and check again.
If not, halt.
A fast lookup structure eliminates redundant scanning.

---

# Approach

Convert *nums* into a set for O(1) membership checks.
While the set contains original, update ***original = original * 2.***
Stop when the value is no longer present.
Return the last value.

---

# Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) to build the set + O(log(maxValue)) updates ≤ O(n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the set.

---

# Code

```ts
function findFinalValue(nums: number[], original: number): number {
    const set = new Set(nums);

    while (set.has(original)) {
        original = original * 2;
    }
    return original;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

nums = [5, 3, 6, 1, 12], original = 3

3 in set → original = 6
6 in set → original = 12
12 in set → original = 24
24 not in set → stop
Return 24
