[1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves/)

# Intuition

To find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of the **deepest leaves** in a binary tree, we need to:

- Identify the deepest leaf nodes.
- Return the lowest node (closest to leaves) such that all deepest leaves are descendants of it.

We can achieve this by performing a **post-order DFS traversal** and computing:

- The **depth** of the deepest leaf in each subtree.
- The **LCA** for the deepest leaves in each subtree.

# Approach

1. Use a **recursive helper function** that returns a pair:
    - `depth`: The maximum depth of the subtree rooted at the current node.    
    - `node`: The lowest common ancestor of the deepest leaves in that subtree.
    
2. Base case:
    - If node is `null`, return `[-1, null]` because depth of null is -1.
    
3. Recursive case:
    - Recursively compute `leftDepth, leftLCA` and `rightDepth, rightLCA`.
    - If `leftDepth == rightDepth`, the current node is the **LCA** of the deepest leaves.
    - If `leftDepth > rightDepth`, the deeper subtree is on the left.
    - If `rightDepth > leftDepth`, the deeper subtree is on the right.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes (we visit every node once).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(h)` for the recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree (worst-case `O(n)` in skewed trees).

# Code

```typescript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *     val: number
 *     left: TreeNode | null
 *     right: TreeNode | null
 *     constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
 *         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *         this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *         this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 *     }
 * }
 */

function lcaDeepestLeaves(root: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null): [number, TreeNode | null] {
        if (!node) return [-1, null];

        const [leftDepth, leftLCA] = dfs(node.left);
        const [rightDepth, rightLCA] = dfs(node.right);

        if (leftDepth === rightDepth) {
            return [leftDepth + 1, node];
        } else if (leftDepth > rightDepth) {
            return [leftDepth + 1, leftLCA];
        } else {
            return [rightDepth + 1, rightLCA];
        }
    }

    return dfs(root)[1];
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```
         3
        / \
       5   1
      / \ / \
     6  2 0  8
       / \
      7   4
```

**Deepest leaves**: 7 and 4 (depth 3)  
**LCA of 7 and 4**: Node `2`

**Output**:

```typescript
TreeNode { val: 2, left: TreeNode { val: 7 }, right: TreeNode { val: 4 } }
```

### **Example 2**

**Input**: `[1]`  
Only one node which is also the deepest.  
**Output**: `1` (LCA of itself)

### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```
      0
     / \
    1   3
     \
      2
```

**Deepest leaf**: `2`  
**Output**: `2` (A node is its own LCA when it's the only deepest leaf)

---

## Summary

- Use **post-order DFS** to compute the **depth** and **LCA** together.
- Efficient with time complexity `O(n)` and space `O(h)`.
- Works well even when only one deepest leaf exists.
- Clean and concise recursive structure.
