[2601. Prime Subtraction Operation](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-subtraction-operation/)

# Intuition
The goal is to make `nums` strictly increasing by choosing indices and subtracting prime numbers from the values at those indices. This can help avoid larger values from blocking the strict increase condition. Since each prime number is a positive integer, each subtraction reduces the current value. We need to find the largest prime possible for each index to make the necessary reduction without overshooting the target for strict increase.

# Approach
1. **Generate Primes**: First, we generate all prime numbers up to 1000 using a modified sieve technique. We’ll store these in a list `p`.
2. **Binary Search for Optimal Prime**: For each number, find the largest prime `p` such that `p < nums[i] - nums[i + 1]` (to ensure we’re only making the current number just smaller than the next).
   - If the current number is already less than the next number, we skip that index.
   - If we can't find a valid prime that satisfies `p < nums[i]`, return `false` since it's impossible to achieve a strictly increasing array.
3. **Modify the Array**: For each element from right to left, adjust `nums[i]` by subtracting an optimal prime so that `nums[i]` becomes strictly smaller than `nums[i + 1]`.
4. **Check Array Validity**: If we can traverse the array without returning `false`, then it is possible to make `nums` strictly increasing.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n ⋅ log p)*** where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `p` is the number of primes up to 1000 (168 primes). Binary searching primes adds efficiency.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(p)***, since we store all primes up to 1000.

# Code

```typescript
function primeSubOperation(nums: number[]): boolean {
    const p: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 2; i <= 1000; ++i) {
        let isPrime = true;
        for (const j of p) {
            if (i % j === 0) {
                isPrime = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isPrime) {
            p.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    const search = (x: number): number => {
        let l = 0;
        let r = p.length;
        while (l < r) {
            const mid = (l + r) >> 1;
            if (p[mid] > x) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    };
    
    const n = nums.length;
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1]) {
            continue;
        }
        const j = search(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]);
        if (j === p.length || p[j] >= nums[i]) {
            return false;
        }
        nums[i] -= p[j];
    }
    return true;
};

### Example Walkthrough

1. **Example 1**: `nums = [4, 9, 6, 10]`
   - Prime numbers list: `[2, 3, 5, 7, ...]`
   - Traverse from the end:
     - Index `0`: `nums[0] = 4` vs `nums[1] = 9`, find a prime `< (4 - 0)`, e.g., `3`.
     - Result after operation: `[1, 9, 6, 10]`
   - Traverse again until the entire list is in strictly increasing order.

2. **Example 2**: `nums = [6, 8, 11, 12]`
   - Already strictly increasing, so no operations are needed.
   - Output: `true`

3. **Example 3**: `nums = [5, 8, 3]`
   - No way to make the sequence strictly increasing.
   - Output: `false`


This solution leverages both efficient prime generation and binary search, making it feasible within the problem constraints.
