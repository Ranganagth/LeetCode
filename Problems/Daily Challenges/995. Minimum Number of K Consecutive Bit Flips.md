[995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/)

# Intuition

The problem requires flipping subarrays of length `k` in a binary array such that all elements become `1`. The challenge is to determine the minimum number of flips needed to achieve this. If it’s impossible, we need to return `-1`.

# Approach

We use a greedy approach with a sliding window technique to keep track of whether an element has been flipped an odd or even number of times. This allows us to determine the actual state of an element without modifying the array repeatedly.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `flipCount` to count the number of flips performed.
   - `currentFlips` to track the number of ongoing flips at any position.
   - `isFlipped` array to keep track of whether a flip operation starts at each index.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For each element, determine if the current bit should be flipped based on `currentFlips`.
   - If a flip is needed and possible (i.e., there’s enough space to perform a `k`-length flip), perform the flip, update `flipCount`, and mark the flip in `isFlipped`.
   - If a flip is needed but not possible (i.e., insufficient length), return `-1`.

3. **Update `currentFlips`**:
   - For each index, update `currentFlips` to reflect the flips ending `k` positions earlier.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. Each element is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)***, where `k` is the length of the subarray. This is due to the `isFlipped` array used for the sliding window.

# Code

```typescript
function minKBitFlips(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    let flipCount = 0;
    let currentFlips = 0;
    const isFlipped = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (i >= k) {
            currentFlips -= isFlipped[i - k];
        }

        if (currentFlips % 2 === nums[i]) {
            if (i + k > n) {
                return -1;
            }
            isFlipped[i] = 1;
            currentFlips++;
            flipCount++;
        }
    }

    return flipCount;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `isFlipped` array keeps track of where flips start.
   - `flipCount` counts the total flips.
   - `currentFlips` tracks ongoing flips at each index.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - If we reach an index where a previous flip of length `k` should end, decrement `currentFlips`.
   - If the bit at the current index needs flipping (based on `currentFlips`), check if a flip is possible within bounds.
   - Perform the flip, update `flipCount`, and mark the flip in `isFlipped`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the total number of flips, or `-1` if it’s impossible to make all elements `1` with the given constraints.
