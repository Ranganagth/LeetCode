[2942. Find Words Containing Character](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-words-containing-character/)

# Intuition
We are given a list of words and a character `x`. The goal is to **find the indices of all words that contain the character `x`**.  

This is a straightforward search problem that requires checking each word individually to see whether it contains the character.

# Approach
1. **Initialize an empty result array** to store indices.
2. **Iterate through each word** in the input array `words`.
3. For each word, **check if the character `x` is present** using `includes(x)`.
4. If the character is present, **store the index** in the result array.
5. Return the result array at the end.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * m)`  
  - `n` is the number of words  
  - `m` is the average length of the words  
  - For each word, we potentially scan up to all `m` characters using `includes`
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`  
  - `k` is the number of words that contain the character `x`, as we store their indices

# Code

```ts
function findWordsContaining(words: string[], x: string): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].includes(x)) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Example and Explanation Walkthrough  

#### Example 1  
```ts
Input: words = ["leet", "code"], x = "e"
Output: [0, 1]
```
- `"leet"` contains `"e"` → index `0`
- `"code"` contains `"e"` → index `1`
- Return `[0, 1]`

---

#### Example 2  
```ts
Input: words = ["abc", "bcd", "aaaa", "cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0, 2]
```
- `"abc"` contains `"a"` → index `0`
- `"bcd"` does **not** contain `"a"` → skip
- `"aaaa"` contains `"a"` → index `2`
- `"cbc"` does **not** contain `"a"` → skip
- Return `[0, 2]`

---

#### Example 3  
```ts
Input: words = ["abc", "bcd", "aaaa", "cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
```
- None of the words contain `"z"`
- Return `[]`

### Summary

This solution uses **simple iteration and character checking** to efficiently find all indices of words that contain a given character. It's optimal and straightforward for the input size constraints.
