[1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon/)

# Intuition

* We have an n-sided convex polygon.
* We must split it into `n-2` triangles.
* Each triangle’s cost is the **product of its 3 vertices**.
* We want the triangulation with **minimum total score**.

This is very similar to problems like:

* Matrix Chain Multiplication
* Burst Balloons

The key idea is:
If we want to triangulate between vertices `i` and `j`, we must pick a third vertex `k` (`i < k < j`) to form triangle `(i, k, j)`.
Then the total score is:

$$
dp[i][j] = \min_{i < k < j} (dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] \times values[j] \times values[k])
$$

---

# Approach

1. Define `dp[i][j]` = minimum triangulation score for polygon vertices from `i` to `j` (inclusive).
2. Base case: if `j - i < 2` → less than 3 vertices → no triangle → `dp[i][j] = 0`.
3. Transition: try all possible `k` between `(i, j)` and compute:

   ```
   dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i]*values[j]*values[k])
   ```
4. Answer = `dp[0][n-1]` (whole polygon).

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n^3)` (3 nested loops: i, j, k).
* **Space:** `O(n^2)` for dp table.
* With n ≤ 50, this is easily feasible.

# Code

```typescript
function minScoreTriangulation(values: number[]): number {
    const n = values.length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Iterate over increasing interval length
    for (let len = 3; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let i = 0; i + len - 1 < n; i++) {
            const j = i + len - 1;
            dp[i][j] = Infinity;

            for (let k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i][j],
                    dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k]
                );
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
values = [1,2,3]
```

* Only one triangle → cost = 1*2*3 = 6.
  Answer = **6** 

---

### Example 2

```
values = [3,7,4,5]
```

Two ways to triangulate:

* (3,7,5) + (7,4,5) = 3*7*5 + 7*4*5 = 105 + 140 = 245
* (3,4,5) + (3,7,4) = 60 + 84 = 144
  Answer = **144**

---

### Example 3

```
values = [1,3,1,4,1,5]
```

Optimal triangulation yields score = **13**.
DP ensures we find this minimum.
