[1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-highest-and-lowest-of-k-scores/)

# Intuition

We need to pick **k scores** such that:

```
(max score) − (min score)
```

is as small as possible.

If the scores are **sorted**, the best choice will always be **k consecutive elements**, because:

* Any gap inside a selection increases the difference
* Sorting lets us minimize the distance between smallest and largest picked values

So the problem becomes finding the **minimum window of size k** in the sorted array.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort** the array `nums`
2. Slide a window of size `k`:

   * For each window `[i ... i+k-1]`, compute:

     ```
     nums[i+k-1] - nums[i]
     ```
3. Track the minimum difference
4. Return the result

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n log n)` (sorting)
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra (in-place sort)

---

# Code

```ts
function minimumDifference(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    if (k === 1) return 0;

    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDiff = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i + k - 1 < nums.length; i++) {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[i + k - 1] - nums[i]);
    }

    return minDiff;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
nums = [90], k = 1
```

Only one student:

```
max − min = 90 − 90 = 0
```

Output:

```
0
```


### Example 2

```
nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2
```

Sorted:

```
[1,4,7,9]
```

Windows:

* [1,4] → diff = 3
* [4,7] → diff = 3
* [7,9] → diff = 2 ← minimum

Output:

```
2
```

## Final Insight

This is a **sorting + sliding window** problem.

Once sorted, choosing consecutive elements guarantees the smallest possible max–min difference.
