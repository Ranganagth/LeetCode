[3516. Find Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-person/)

# Intuition

We need to check who among Person 1 (at `x`) and Person 2 (at `y`) reaches Person 3 (at `z`) first. Since both move at the same speed, the only factor that matters is the **distance** each person has to travel to reach `z`.

* If `|x - z| < |y - z|`, Person 1 is closer and arrives first.
* If `|y - z| < |x - z|`, Person 2 is closer and arrives first.
* If both distances are equal, they arrive at the same time.

---

# Approach

1. Compute the absolute distance between Person 1 and Person 3 → `dist1 = |x - z|`.
2. Compute the absolute distance between Person 2 and Person 3 → `dist2 = |y - z|`.
3. Compare:

   * If `dist1 < dist2`, return `1`.
   * If `dist2 < dist1`, return `2`.
   * Otherwise, return `0`.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** `O(1)` → Just a few arithmetic operations.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` → No extra space used.

# Code

```typescript
function findClosest(x: number, y: number, z: number): number {
    const dist1 = Math.abs(x - z);
    const dist2 = Math.abs(y - z);

    if (dist1 < dist2) return 1;
    if (dist2 < dist1) return 2;
    return 0;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

Input: `x = 2, y = 7, z = 4`

* `dist1 = |2 - 4| = 2`
* `dist2 = |7 - 4| = 3`
  Since `2 < 3`, Person 1 reaches first.
  **Output: 1**

### Example 2

Input: `x = 2, y = 5, z = 6`

* `dist1 = |2 - 6| = 4`
* `dist2 = |5 - 6| = 1`
  Since `1 < 4`, Person 2 reaches first.
  **Output: 2**

### Example 3

Input: `x = 1, y = 5, z = 3`

* `dist1 = |1 - 3| = 2`
* `dist2 = |5 - 3| = 2`
  Both are equal.
  **Output: 0**
