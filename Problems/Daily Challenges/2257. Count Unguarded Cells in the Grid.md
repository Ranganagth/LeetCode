[2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of counting unguarded cells, we need to simulate the vision of guards in the four cardinal directions. Guards cannot see past walls or other guards. A direct simulation can be inefficient for large grids, so an optimized approach is required:

1. Utilize a **set-based approach** to mark cells that are guarded or blocked (by walls or guards themselves).
2. Efficiently simulate the vision of guards by traversing the grid row by row and column by column.

# Approach

1. **Setup Data Structures**:
    
    - Create sets to store the positions of guards and walls for quick lookup.
    - Use an additional set to track guarded cells.
2. **Simulate Guard Vision**:
    
    - For each guard, expand their vision in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) until encountering another guard, a wall, or the grid boundary.
    - Mark all these cells as guarded.
3. **Count Unguarded Cells**:
    
    - Iterate through all cells of the grid.
    - A cell is unguarded if it is not in the sets of walls, guards, or guarded cells.
4. **Optimization**:
    
    - Only traverse relevant rows and columns affected by guards.
    - Use efficient grid traversal for minimal computation.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m+n+gâ‹…k)***, where:
    - *m* and *n* are the grid dimensions,
    - *g* is the number of guards,
    - *k* is the average distance covered by each guard's vision (stops at walls or grid boundaries).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(w+g)***, where:
    - *w* is the number of walls,
    - *g* is the number of guards.

# Code

```typescript
function countUnguarded(m: number, n: number, guards: number[][], walls: number[][]): number {
    const guarded = new Set<string>();
    const blockSet = new Set<string>();

    // Add guards and walls to the blocked set
    for (const [row, col] of guards) {
        blockSet.add(`${row},${col}`);
    }
    for (const [row, col] of walls) {
        blockSet.add(`${row},${col}`);
    }

    // Helper to mark cells as guarded in a direction
    const markGuarded = (row: number, col: number, dr: number, dc: number) => {
        let r = row + dr, c = col + dc;
        while (r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n && !blockSet.has(`${r},${c}`)) {
            guarded.add(`${r},${c}`);
            r += dr;
            c += dc;
        }
    };

    // Simulate guard vision in all four directions
    for (const [row, col] of guards) {
        markGuarded(row, col, -1, 0); // Up
        markGuarded(row, col, 1, 0);  // Down
        markGuarded(row, col, 0, -1); // Left
        markGuarded(row, col, 0, 1);  // Right
    }

    // Count unguarded cells
    let unguardedCount = 0;
    for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            const cell = `${row},${col}`;
            if (!blockSet.has(cell) && !guarded.has(cell)) {
                unguardedCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    return unguardedCount;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

**Input**:  
`m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]]`, `walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]`  
**Steps**:

1. Mark the positions of guards and walls in the blocked set.
2. Simulate vision:
    - Guard at (0,0) marks cells [(0,1), (1,0), (2,0)] as guarded.
    - Guard at (1,1) marks cells [(0,1), (1,2), (1,0)] as guarded (stopping at walls).
    - Guard at (2,3) marks cells [(3,3), (2,4)] as guarded.
3. Count unguarded cells:
    - Total = 77.

**Output**: `7`

#### Example 2

**Input**:  
`m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]]`, `walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]`  
**Steps**:

1. Mark the positions of guards and walls in the blocked set.
2. Simulate vision:
    - Guard at (1,1) is surrounded by walls, marking no additional cells as guarded.
3. Count unguarded cells:
    - Total = 44.

**Output**: `4`

### Key Insights

- Guards and walls are natural blockers, making simulation efficient by restricting unnecessary cell traversal.
- Using sets for guards, walls, and guarded cells ensures ***O(1)*** lookups, speeding up the process.
- By focusing on affected rows/columns, the solution efficiently scales for large grids.
