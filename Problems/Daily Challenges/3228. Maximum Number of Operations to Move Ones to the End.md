# Intuition

When you slide a `'1'` over a contiguous block of zeros it always lands at the **last position of that zero-block** (just before the next `'1'` or at the string end). A block of zeros only becomes _available_ for moves after all ones to its left exist — so you can count how many ones are to the left when that zero-block is considered. Each such left-side `'1'` can be used exactly once for that zero-block to perform a valid operation. Summing over every zero-block (only when the block ends) the number of ones to its left gives the maximum number of operations.

---
# Approach

1. Scan the string left → right. Maintain:
    
    - `ones` = count of `'1'` seen so far.
    - `ans` = accumulated operations.
    
2. When you encounter a `'1'`, increment `ones`.
    
3. When you encounter a `'0'`, check whether it is the **last zero of its contiguous zero-block** (i.e., either next index is out of bounds or `s[i+1] === '1'`).
    - If it is the last zero of the block, add `ones` to `ans`. That represents every `'1'` to the left being able to use this zero-block once.
    
4. Return `ans`.

This is linear and greedy: we only count a zero-block once (at its last zero) and multiply by how many ones are available on the left - which exactly equals the number of independent operations that block can enable.

# Complexity

- **Time complexity:** $O(n)$ - single pass through the string.
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$ - only two counters.

# Code

```typescript
function maxOperations(s: string): number {
  let ones = 0;
  let ans = 0;
  const n = s.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (s[i] === '1') {
      ones++;
    } else {
      // s[i] == '0'
      // if this is the end of the current zero-block (next is '1' or end of string)
      if (i + 1 === n || s[i + 1] === '1') {
        ans += ones;
      }
    }
  }

  return ans;
}
```

# Example walkthrough with explanation

s = `"1001101"` (indices 0..6)

Scan left → right:

- i=0: `'1'` → `ones = 1`.  
- i=1: `'0'` and next is `'0'` → not end of zero-block → skip.
- i=2: `'0'` and next is `'1'` → end of zero-block → `ans += ones = 1` → `ans = 1`.
- i=3: `'1'` → `ones = 2`.
- i=4: `'1'` → `ones = 3`.
- i=5: `'0'` and next is `'1'` → end of zero-block → `ans += ones = 3` → `ans = 4`.
- i=6: `'1'` → `ones = 4`.

Return `ans = 4`.
