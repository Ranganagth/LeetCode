[1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-subarray-with-absolute-diff-less-than-or-equal-to-limit/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to keep track of the maximum and minimum elements in the current subarray, as these determine the absolute difference. If the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray exceeds the given limit, we need to adjust the subarray.

A sliding window approach is suitable here, where we expand the window by moving the right pointer and shrink it by moving the left pointer to ensure the condition is met.

# Approach

1. **Sliding Window with Deques**: 
   - Use two deques: one to keep track of the maximum values and another for the minimum values within the current window.
   - As we iterate through the array with a right pointer (`r`), maintain the deques such that they always represent the maximum and minimum values in the current window.
   - If at any point, the difference between the maximum and minimum values exceeds the limit, move the left pointer (`l`) to the right to reduce the window size until the condition is met again.
   - Keep track of the maximum length of any valid window during the process.

2. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the array. Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
   - **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** in the worst case for the deques.

# Code
```typescript
function longestSubarray(nums: number[], limit: number): number {
    const maxDeque: number[] = [];
    const minDeque: number[] = [];
    let l = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let r = 0; r < nums.length; r++) {
        while (maxDeque.length && nums[r] > maxDeque[maxDeque.length - 1]) {
            maxDeque.pop();
        }
        maxDeque.push(nums[r]);
        
        while (minDeque.length && nums[r] < minDeque[minDeque.length - 1]) {
            minDeque.pop();
        }
        minDeque.push(nums[r]);

        while (maxDeque[0] - minDeque[0] > limit) {
            if (maxDeque[0] === nums[l]) maxDeque.shift();
            if (minDeque[0] === nums[l]) minDeque.shift();
            l++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, r - l + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `maxDeque` and `minDeque` are used to maintain the maximum and minimum values in the current window.
   - `l` is the left pointer of the window.
   - `maxLength` stores the maximum length of a valid window.

2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - For each element at index `r`, maintain the `maxDeque` and `minDeque`.
   - If the difference between the front elements of `maxDeque` and `minDeque` exceeds the limit, move the left pointer `l` to the right and update the deques accordingly.
   - Calculate the length of the current valid window and update `maxLength`.
