539. Minimum Time Difference

### Problem Overview:
You are given a list of time points in "HH:MM" format representing 24-hour times. The goal is to find the minimum difference (in minutes) between any two time points in the list.

# Intuition:
1. **Circular Time Representation**:
   - A key observation is that the 24-hour clock is circular. For example, the difference between "23:59" and "00:00" is 1 minute, even though numerically the two times are far apart when viewed linearly.

2. **Convert Time to Minutes**:
   - To simplify the problem, convert each time point into its total minutes since midnight. For example, "00:00" becomes 0 minutes and "23:59" becomes 1439 minutes.

3. **Sort the Time Points**:
   - Once all the time points are converted to their respective minute values, sort them in increasing order. The minimum difference between any two times will be either between consecutive times or between the first and last times (considering the circular nature of the clock).

4. **Compute Differences**:
   - After sorting, compute the difference between each consecutive pair of times and also compute the "wrap-around" difference between the last and the first time to account for the circular nature of the 24-hour clock.

# Approach:
1. Convert each time string to minutes from midnight using the formula:
   **minutes = hours Ã— 60 + minutes**
2. Sort the array of time points.
3. Compute the differences between consecutive time points.
4. Also, compute the circular difference between the last and the first time points (since 24-hour time is circular).
5. Return the minimum of all the computed differences.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, where `n` is the number of time points. This is primarily due to sorting the time points.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, since we store all the time points converted into minutes.

# Code:

```typescript
function findMinDifference(timePoints: string[]): number {
    const convertToMinutes = (time: string): number => {
        const [hours, minutes] = time.split(":").map(Number);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    };

    const minutesArr = timePoints.map(convertToMinutes);

    minutesArr.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let minDiff = Infinity;

    for (let i = 1; i < minutesArr.length; i++) {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, minutesArr[i] - minutesArr[i - 1]);
    }

    const circularDiff = (24 * 60) - minutesArr[minutesArr.length - 1] + minutesArr[0];
    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, circularDiff);

    return minDiff;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **convertToMinutes**: This helper function takes a time string in "HH:MM" format and converts it into total minutes from midnight using simple arithmetic (`hours * 60 + minutes`).

2. **minutesArr**: This array stores all the time points converted into minutes. After converting, the array is sorted in ascending order to make it easier to compute the differences between consecutive times.

3. **minDiff Calculation**: 
   - We loop through the sorted `minutesArr` and compute the difference between each consecutive pair of time points. The smallest difference is updated using `Math.min`.
   - Additionally, we handle the circular nature of the clock by calculating the "wrap-around" difference between the last and first time points (i.e., the difference between midnight and the last time point on the next day).

4. **Return the Result**: After calculating all possible differences, the minimum one is returned.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `timePoints = ["23:59", "00:00"]`

1. **Convert to Minutes**:
   - "23:59" -> 1439 minutes
   - "00:00" -> 0 minutes

2. **Sorted Time Points**: `[0, 1439]`

3. **Compute Differences**:
   - Difference between consecutive times: `1439 - 0 = 1439`
   - Circular difference: `(24 * 60) - 1439 + 0 = 1`

4. **Minimum Difference**: The minimum between `1439` and `1` is `1`.

Output: `1`

#### Example 2:
Input: `timePoints = ["00:00", "23:59", "00:00"]`

1. **Convert to Minutes**:
   - "00:00" -> 0 minutes
   - "23:59" -> 1439 minutes
   - "00:00" -> 0 minutes

2. **Sorted Time Points**: `[0, 0, 1439]`

3. **Compute Differences**:
   - Difference between `0` and `0`: `0`
   - Difference between `1439` and `0`: `1439`
   - Circular difference: `(24 * 60) - 1439 + 0 = 1`

4. **Minimum Difference**: The minimum between `0`, `1439`, and `1` is `0`.

Output: `0`

### Conclusion:
By converting time points into minutes and sorting them, we can efficiently compute the minimum time difference. This approach handles the circular nature of 24-hour time by also considering the "wrap-around" case between the last and first time points. The overall time complexity is dominated by sorting, making it an efficient solution even for large inputs.
