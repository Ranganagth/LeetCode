[1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/)

# Intuition:

The goal is to pick one cell from each row in a matrix such that the sum of the selected cell values is maximized. However, you need to account for a penalty, which is the absolute difference between the column indices of the selected cells in two consecutive rows. The challenge is to balance maximizing the points from selected cells while minimizing the penalty.

# Approach:

#### Dynamic Programming:

1. **Initialization**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum points possible up to each row. Create a DP array where `dp[c]` represents the maximum points that can be achieved up to the current row by selecting the cell at column `c`.

2. **Transition Between Rows**:
    - For each row, calculate the potential points for each column, considering the best possible points from the previous row.
    - To efficiently compute the max points considering the penalty (`abs(c₁ - c₂)`), we can use two passes:
        - **Left-to-right pass**: Keep track of the maximum value considering the left side.
        - **Right-to-left pass**: Keep track of the maximum value considering the right side.
    - After calculating these potential values for each column, update the `dp` array for the current row.

3. **Result**: After processing all rows, the maximum value in the `dp` array will be the maximum points you can achieve.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. This is because for each row, we are processing every column in ***O(n)*** time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the DP array, since we only need to keep track of the values for the current and previous rows.

# Code:

```typescript
function maxPoints(points: number[][]): number {
    const m = points.length;
    const n = points[0].length;
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
        dp[c] = points[0][c];
    }

    for (let r = 1; r < m; r++) {
        const left = new Array(n).fill(0);
        const right = new Array(n).fill(0);
        const new_dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

        left[0] = dp[0];
        for (let c = 1; c < n; c++) {
            left[c] = Math.max(left[c - 1], dp[c] + c);
        }

        right[n - 1] = dp[n - 1] - (n - 1);
        for (let c = n - 2; c >= 0; c--) {
            right[c] = Math.max(right[c + 1], dp[c] - c);
        }

        for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            new_dp[c] = points[r][c] + Math.max(left[c] - c, right[c] + c);
        }

        dp = new_dp;
    }

    return Math.max(...dp);
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(maxPoints([[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]])); // Output: 9
console.log(maxPoints([[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]])); // Output: 11
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized with the values from the first row, as the starting point for our DP approach.

2. **Transition**:
    - **Left-to-right**: We calculate the maximum value that can be obtained from the left side, considering the cost of moving to the current column.
    - **Right-to-left**: We calculate the maximum value from the right side.
    - These two arrays (`left` and `right`) allow us to efficiently compute the best possible value for each column in the current row.

3. **Result**: After processing all rows, the maximum value in the `dp` array is the answer.
