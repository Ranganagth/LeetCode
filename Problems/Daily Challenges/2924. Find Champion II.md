[2924. Find Champion II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-champion-ii/)

# Intuition:

The problem involves finding a unique team (node) in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that has no incoming edges. This team represents the "champion," as no other team is stronger than it. If there is more than one team with no incoming edges, then the champion is not unique, and we return `-1`.

The solution leverages the **in-degree** property of nodes in the graph:

- Nodes with an in-degree of `0` are not weaker than any other nodes.
- The champion is the node with `in-degree = 0` if and only if it is the unique node with such a property.

# Approach:

1. **Track In-Degrees**:
    
    - Create an array to store the in-degrees of all nodes. Initialize all in-degrees to `0`.
    - For each edge `[u, v]`, increment the in-degree of node `v` because there is a directed edge from `u` to `v`.
2. **Identify Candidates for Champion**:
    
    - Iterate through the in-degree array and count how many nodes have an in-degree of `0`.
    - If exactly one node has an in-degree of `0`, it is the champion.
    - If there are zero or multiple nodes with an in-degree of `0`, return `-1`.
3. **Output the Champion**:
    
    - Return the index of the unique node with `in-degree = 0`, or `-1` if such a node is not unique.

# Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where *n* is the number of nodes and *m* is the number of edges.
    - Calculating in-degrees involves iterating through all edges: ***O(m)***.
    - Iterating through the in-degree array takes ***O(n)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the in-degree array.
    

# Code

```typescript
function findChampion(n: number, edges: number[][]): number {
    // Step 1: Initialize in-degree array
    const indeg: number[] = Array(n).fill(0);

    // Step 2: Compute in-degrees
    for (const [_, v] of edges) {
        indeg[v]++;
    }

    // Step 3: Identify the node with in-degree of 0
    let champion = -1;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (indeg[i] === 0) {
            champion = i;
            count++;
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Check uniqueness
    return count === 1 ? champion : -1;
};

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `indeg = [0, 0, 0]`.
- **Step 2**: Process edges:
    - Edge `[0, 1]`: Increment `indeg[1] → indeg = [0, 1, 0]`.
    - Edge `[1, 2]`: Increment `indeg[2] → indeg = [0, 1, 1]`.
- **Step 3**: Find nodes with `indeg = 0`:
    - Node `0` has `indeg = 0`.
- **Step 4**: Check uniqueness:
    - Only one node (`0`) has `indeg = 0`.
- **Output**:

```typescript
0
```

#### Example 2:

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `indeg = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
- **Step 2**: Process edges:
    - Edge `[0, 2]`: Increment `indeg[2] → indeg = [0, 0, 1, 0]`.
    - Edge `[1, 3]`: Increment `indeg[3] → indeg = [0, 0, 1, 1]`.
    - Edge `[1, 2]`: Increment `indeg[2] → indeg = [0, 0, 2, 1]`.
- **Step 3**: Find nodes with `indeg = 0`:
    - Nodes `0` and `1` have `indeg = 0`.
- **Step 4**: Check uniqueness:
    - Multiple nodes (`0` and `1`) have `indeg = 0`.
- **Output**:

```typescript
-1
```

#### Example 3:

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 2, edges = []
```

- **Step 1**: Initialize `indeg = [0, 0]`.
- **Step 2**: No edges to process, `indeg` remains `[0, 0]`.
- **Step 3**: Find nodes with `indeg = 0`:
    - Nodes `0` and `1` have `indeg = 0`.
- **Step 4**: Check uniqueness:
    - Multiple nodes (`0` and `1`) have `indeg = 0`.
- **Output**:

```typescript
-1
```

### Key Insights:

- The problem is fundamentally about finding a node with no incoming edges.
- The "uniqueness" constraint makes it essential to count such nodes.
- DAG properties (no cycles, transitive relationships) ensure that we don't need more complex checks.
