[592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/)

# Intuition:
1. **Parsing the Expression**: We need to extract individual fractions from the input string and correctly account for the signs.
2. **LCM for Denominators**: To add or subtract fractions, we first need to bring them to a common denominator, which requires finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators.
3. **Simplifying the Result**: After performing the arithmetic, we simplify the resulting fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).
4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the result is 0, where we should return `0/1`.

# Approach:
1. **Extract Fractions**: Use regular expressions to parse the fractions from the expression.
2. **Compute**: Iterate through the fractions, adding or subtracting them by converting to a common denominator.
3. **Simplify**: Simplify the final fraction by dividing by the GCD of the numerator and denominator.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of fractions in the expression. The complexity is primarily due to the parsing and GCD/LCM calculations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we are using a constant amount of space to store the intermediate results.

# Code:

```typescript
function fractionAddition(expression: string): string {
    function gcd(a: number, b: number): number {
        return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    function lcm(a: number, b: number): number {
        return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
    }

    let numerator = 0;
    let denominator = 1;

    const regex = /([+-]?\d+)\/(\d+)/g;
    let match;

    while ((match = regex.exec(expression)) !== null) {
        const num = parseInt(match[1], 10);
        const den = parseInt(match[2], 10);

        const commonDen = lcm(denominator, den);

        numerator = numerator * (commonDen / denominator) + num * (commonDen / den);
        denominator = commonDen;

        const commonGCD = gcd(Math.abs(numerator), denominator);
        numerator /= commonGCD;
        denominator /= commonGCD;
    }

    if (numerator === 0) {
        return "0/1";
    }

    return `${numerator}/${denominator}`;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2")); // Output: "0/1"
console.log(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2+1/3")); // Output: "1/3"
console.log(fractionAddition("1/3-1/2")); // Output: "-1/6"
```

### Explanation:
- **GCD and LCM Functions**: We use these helper functions to find the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, which are essential for adding fractions.
- **Regex Parsing**: The regular expression `/([+-]?\d+)\/(\d+)/g` extracts the sign, numerator, and denominator from each fraction in the expression.
- **Simplification**: After each addition or subtraction, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
