[1140. Stone Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-ii/)

# Intuition:
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- Both players can take between 1 and `2 * M` piles of stones during their turn. After each turn, `M` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the number of piles taken.
- Alice wants to maximize her stones, while Bob tries to minimize Alice's score.

This problem is a classic example of a "game theory" problem, where dynamic programming can be used to determine the optimal strategy for Alice, considering that Bob will also play optimally.

# Dynamic Programming Approach:
- We use a 2D dynamic programming table `dp[i][M]` where:
  - `i` represents the index of the current pile.
  - `M` represents the current value of M.
  - `dp[i][M]` stores the maximum number of stones Alice can collect starting from pile `i` with the current `M`.

- The main idea is to recursively compute the maximum stones Alice can collect from a certain pile onwards, considering that both players play optimally. 

- We start from the last pile and work backward. At each step, we consider taking between 1 and `2 * M` piles and calculate the maximum stones Alice can obtain.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - If `i` is the last pile, then `dp[i][M]` will simply be the sum of all remaining piles since Alice can take them all.

2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each possible `X` (number of piles Alice can take), calculate the stones Alice can get and compare it to what Bob would leave her after his optimal move.

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The answer is stored in `dp[0][1]` because Alice starts at the first pile with `M = 1`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n³)*** where *n* is the number of piles. This comes from filling the `dp` table, where each cell computation involves checking up to *2 * M* options.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** for storing the `dp` table.

# Code:

```typescript
function stoneGameII(piles: number[]): number {
    const n = piles.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    const suffixSum = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        suffixSum[i] = piles[i] + suffixSum[i + 1];
    }
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let M = 1; M <= n; M++) {
            let maxStones = 0;
            for (let X = 1; X <= 2 * M && i + X <= n; X++) {
                maxStones = Math.max(maxStones, suffixSum[i] - dp[i + X][Math.max(M, X)]);
            }
            dp[i][M] = maxStones;
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][1];
};

```
## Example usage:

```Typescript
console.log(stoneGameII([2,7,9,4,4])); // Output: 10
console.log(stoneGameII([1,2,3,4,5,100])); // Output: 104
```

### Explanation:

1. **Suffix Sum Array**:
   - `suffixSum[i]` stores the total number of stones from pile `i` to the last pile. This helps us efficiently calculate the stones left for Alice and Bob after each move.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - `dp[i][M]` is filled using the bottom-up approach, where we compute the best possible stones Alice can collect starting from each pile with the current `M`.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The value at `dp[0][1]` gives us the maximum number of stones Alice can collect when she starts from the first pile with `M = 1`.
