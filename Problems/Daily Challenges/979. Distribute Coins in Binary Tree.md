[979. Distribute Coins in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-18)

# Intuition:
To distribute the coins optimally among the nodes of the binary tree, we need to ensure that each node has exactly one coin. This means that for any node with more than one coin, we need to distribute the excess coins to its children or parent nodes until all nodes have exactly one coin.

# Approach:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We will perform a depth-first traversal of the binary tree. At each node, we will calculate the excess or deficit of coins, which represents the number of moves needed for that node to have exactly one coin.
2. **Recursion:** We will use recursion to traverse the tree and calculate the excess or deficit of coins for each node. The excess or deficit at each node will be the sum of coins in that node plus the excess or deficit from its left and right children, minus one (to ensure that the node itself has exactly one coin).

3. **Accumulate Moves:** While traversing the tree, we will accumulate the absolute value of excess or deficit coins at each node. This will give us the total number of moves required to redistribute the coins optimally.

4. **Return Total Moves:** Finally, we return the total number of moves calculated during the DFS traversal.

# Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is **_O(N)_**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we perform a depth-first traversal of the tree, visiting each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **_O(H)_**, where `H` is the height of the binary tree. This space is used for the recursive call stack during the depth-first traversal. In the worst case, if the tree is skewed, the height of the tree could be **_O(N)_**, making the space complexity **_O(N)_**. However, for a balanced binary tree, the space complexity is **_O(log N)_**.

# Code
```TypeScript
function distributeCoins(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    let moves = 0;

    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null): number {
        if (!node) return 0;

        const leftExcess = dfs(node.left);
        const rightExcess = dfs(node.right);

        moves += Math.abs(leftExcess) + Math.abs(rightExcess);

        return node.val + leftExcess + rightExcess - 1;
    }

    dfs(root);
    return moves;
};

```
