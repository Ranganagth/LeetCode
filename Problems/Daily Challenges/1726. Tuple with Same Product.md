[1726. Tuple with Same Product](https://leetcode.com/problems/tuple-with-same-product/)


## **Intuition**

We need to find the number of valid tuples *(a, b, c, d)* such that:

*a × b = c × d*

for distinct elements *a, b, c, d* from the given array. Instead of iterating over all possible quadruples (which would be inefficient), we can:
1. **Precompute products efficiently**: Instead of iterating over all quadruples, we store products of pairs in a frequency map.
2. **Use frequency counting**: If multiple pairs produce the same product, we can efficiently count valid tuples from them.

The key observation is that if a product pp appears ff times in our frequency map, then the number of valid tuples is:

$$
\text{Valid tuples} = 8 \times \binom{f}{2} = 8 \times \frac{f \times (f - 1)}{2}
$$



# Approach

1. **Use a HashMap to store product frequencies:**
    - Iterate through all possible pairs (i, j) with *i < j*.
    - Compute their product and store it in a hash map where keys are products and values are the count of occurrences.
2. **Calculate valid tuples from the map:**
    - For each product that appears *f* times, we use the combination formula $$\binom{f}{2}$$ to count the number of ways to choose two pairs forming the same product.
    - Since each valid pair contributes to **8** unique permutations, we multiply the count by **8**.


# Complexity Analysis

- **Computing products:** *O(n²)*, where nn is the length of `nums` (since we check all pairs).
- **Storing in a hash map:** *O(n²)* (insertion and retrieval are *O(1)* on average).
- **Processing the hash map:** *O(n²)*.
- **Total Complexity:** **O(n²)**, which is feasible for *n ≤ 1000*.


# Code

```typescript
function tupleSameProduct(nums: number[]): number {
    const productCount: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    let count = 0;

    // Step 1: Compute all product pairs and store frequency
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            let product = nums[i] * nums[j];
            productCount.set(product, (productCount.get(product) || 0) + 1);
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Compute valid tuples using combination formula
    for (const freq of productCount.values()) {
        if (freq > 1) {
            count += 8 * (freq * (freq - 1)) / 2;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input**

```typescript
nums = [2, 3, 4, 6];
```

#### **Steps**

1. Compute product pairs:
    
    ```
    2 * 3 = 6 → (6 appears 1 time)
    2 * 4 = 8 → (8 appears 1 time)
    2 * 6 = 12 → (12 appears 1 time)
    3 * 4 = 12 → (12 appears 2 times)
    3 * 6 = 18 → (18 appears 1 time)
    4 * 6 = 24 → (24 appears 1 time)
    ```
    
2. Product frequency map:
    
    ```
    { 6: 1, 8: 1, 12: 2, 18: 1, 24: 1 }
    ```
    
3. Only `12` has more than one occurrence (`f = 2`).
4. Using formula:
    
    ```
    8 * (2 * (2 - 1) / 2) = 8 * 1 = 8
    ```
    
5. **Output:** `8`


### **Example 2**

#### **Input**

```typescript
nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 10];
```

#### **Steps**

6. Compute product pairs:
    
    ```
    1 * 2 = 2,   1 * 4 = 4,   1 * 5 = 5,   1 * 10 = 10
    2 * 4 = 8,   2 * 5 = 10,  2 * 10 = 20
    4 * 5 = 20,  4 * 10 = 40
    5 * 10 = 50
    ```
    
7. Product frequency map:
    
    ```
    { 2: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 8: 1, 10: 2, 20: 2, 40: 1, 50: 1 }
    ```
    
8. Valid products:
    - `10 → f = 2`
    - `20 → f = 2`
9. Compute tuples:
    
    ```
    8 * (2 * 1 / 2) = 8 * 1 = 8 (for 10)
    8 * (2 * 1 / 2) = 8 * 1 = 8 (for 20)
    ```
    
10. **Output:** `16`

## **Edge Cases Considered**

- **Small arrays** (e.g., `[1,2]`) → Should return `0`.  
- **All numbers prime** → No valid tuples.  
- **Large values but distinct** → Still works efficiently.  
- **All numbers power of 2** → Many valid tuples.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

- **Optimized O(n²) approach**  
- **Utilizes hash maps for efficiency**  
- **Handles large constraints effectively**

This solution efficiently computes the number of valid `(a, b, c, d)` tuples where *a × b = c × d* using **precomputed product frequencies** and **combination formulas**!
