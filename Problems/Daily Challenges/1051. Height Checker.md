[1051. Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/)

# Intuition:
1. **Expected Order**: The expected order is obtained by sorting the `heights` array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Comparison**: Compare each element of the `heights` array with the corresponding element in the sorted (expected) array.
3. **Count Mismatches**: Count the indices where the elements in the `heights` array do not match those in the sorted array.

# Approach:
1. **Sort the Heights**: Create a sorted version of the `heights` array which represents the expected order.
2. **Compare and Count**: Iterate through the `heights` array and compare each element with the corresponding element in the sorted array. Increment a counter for each mismatch.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step, where `n` is the number of elements in the `heights` array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we are creating a copy of the `heights` array for sorting.

# Code
```typescript
function heightChecker(heights: number[]): number {
    const expected = [...heights].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let mismatchCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        if (heights[i] !== expected[i]) {
            mismatchCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return mismatchCount;
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: We first sort the `heights` array to get the `expected` array.
2. **Comparison**: We iterate through the `heights` array and compare each element with the corresponding element in the `expected` array. Each time we find a mismatch, we increment our mismatch counter.
3. **Result**: Finally, we return the count of mismatches.
