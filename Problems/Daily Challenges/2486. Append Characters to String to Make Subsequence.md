[2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence/)

# Intuition
To determine the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to `s` so that `t` becomes a subsequence of `s`, we need to find the longest prefix of `t` that is already a subsequence of `s`. The characters of `t` that follow this prefix will be the ones we need to append to `s`.

# Approach
1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - Use two pointers to traverse `s` and `t`. Let's call these pointers `i` and `j` for `s` and `t` respectively.
   - Start both pointers at the beginning of their respective strings.
   - Move the pointer `i` through `s` and try to match the current character of `t` pointed to by `j`.
   - If `s[i]` matches `t[j]`, move `j` to the next character in `t`.
   - Continue this process until either all characters of `t` have been matched (i.e., `j` reaches the length of `t`) or `i` reaches the end of `s`.
2. **Determine the Number of Characters to Append**:
   - The number of characters that need to be appended to `s` is the number of characters in `t` that were not matched by the time `i` reaches the end of `s`. This is calculated as `t.length - j`.

# Explanation
1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` at 0.
2. Iterate through `s` with pointer `i` and try to match the characters of `t` using pointer `j`.
3. If a match is found (i.e., `s[i] == t[j]`), increment `j`.
4. Continue the iteration until the end of `s` is reached.
5. The characters that are left in `t` (i.e., `t.length - j`) are the ones that need to be appended to `s` for `t` to become a subsequence of `s`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - The algorithm traverses each character of `s` and `t` at most once, resulting in a time complexity of ***O(n + m)***, where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `t`.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(1)*** since only a few extra variables are used regardless of the input size.

# Code
```TypeScript
function minCharactersToAdd(s: string, t: string): number {
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;
    const n = s.length;
    const m = t.length;

    while (i < n && j < m) {
        if (s[i] === t[j]) {
            j++;
        }
        i++;
    }

    return m - j;
};
