[3163. String Compression III](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression-iii/)

# Intuition

The task is to compress a string by iteratively finding and removing the longest prefix that consists of the same character repeated, appending the count and the character to a new string. This involves keeping track of the number of consecutive characters (up to 9) as we traverse the string.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty string `comp` to hold the compressed result.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Use a loop to traverse the string `word`:
   - Keep track of the current character and its count.
   - Continue counting the current character until a different character is encountered or until the count reaches 9.
   - Once the loop detects a change (or the end of the string is reached), append the count followed by the character to `comp`.
   - Reset the current character and its count for the next sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**: Handle characters that repeat more than 9 times properly, ensuring that only the maximum of 9 is counted in each operation.

# Complexity:
   - **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the input string since each character is processed once.
   - **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** in the worst case for the output string, if every character is unique.

# Code:

```typescript
function compressString(word: string): string {
    let comp = '';
    let i = 0;

    while (i < word.length) {
        const char = word[i];
        let count = 0;

        while (i < word.length && word[i] === char && count < 9) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }

        comp += count + char;
    }

    return comp;
};

```

### Explanation and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

Input:
```plaintext
word = "abcde"
```

1. **Initialization**: `comp` is `""`, `i` is `0`.
2. **Iteration**:
   - **First Iteration**: 
     - Character: `a`, Count: `1`
     - `comp` becomes `"1a"`.
   - **Second Iteration**:
     - Character: `b`, Count: `1`
     - `comp` becomes `"1a1b"`.
   - **Third Iteration**:
     - Character: `c`, Count: `1`
     - `comp` becomes `"1a1b1c"`.
   - **Fourth Iteration**:
     - Character: `d`, Count: `1`
     - `comp` becomes `"1a1b1c1d"`.
   - **Fifth Iteration**:
     - Character: `e`, Count: `1`
     - `comp` becomes `"1a1b1c1d1e"`.

3. **Final Output**: 
```plaintext
"1a1b1c1d1e"
```

#### Example 2

Input:
```plaintext
word = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb"
```

1. **Initialization**: `comp` is `""`, `i` is `0`.
2. **Iteration**:
   - **First Iteration**:
     - Character: `a`, Count: `9` (maxed out)
     - `comp` becomes `"9a"`.
   - **Second Iteration**:
     - Count continues from previous count, next character is still `a`, Count: `5`
     - `comp` becomes `"9a5a"`.
   - **Third Iteration**:
     - Character: `b`, Count: `2`
     - `comp` becomes `"9a5a2b"`.

3. **Final Output**: 
```plaintext
"9a5a2b"
```

### Summary

The provided function efficiently compresses the string by counting consecutive characters and appending their counts alongside the characters to a result string. The algorithm runs in linear time, ensuring that it handles even the upper limits of input sizes effectively.
