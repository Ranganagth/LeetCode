[1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-candies-you-can-get-from-boxes/)

# Intuition

We are given:
* Initial boxes we can access.
* Some are open, some are closed.
* Open boxes may contain:
  * **Candies** to collect.
  * **Keys** to unlock other boxes.
  * **Other boxes** that we can explore recursively.

The goal is to **simulate opening boxes**, collecting candies, using found keys, and exploring nested boxes — **as long as we can continue making progress**.

This is naturally modeled as a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** problem:
* We explore boxes level-by-level.
* Whenever we gain access to a new box (by either finding it or getting a key), we add it to our queue.
* We avoid re-processing already visited boxes.

# Approach

1. Initialize a queue with `initialBoxes`.
2. Use sets to track:
   * `haveKey`: the keys we’ve collected.
   * `seenBox`: the boxes we’ve seen but couldn’t open yet.
   * `visited`: to avoid revisiting a box.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   * Dequeue a box.
   * If the box is already visited, skip it.
   * If the box is **closed** and we don't have the key, store it for later and continue.
   * Otherwise:
     * Mark it as visited.
     * Collect candies.
     * Add any **new keys** to `haveKey`.
     * If the newly acquired key matches a box in `seenBox`, push it to the queue.
     * Add all **contained boxes** to the queue.
4. Repeat until no more progress can be made.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — Each box is processed at most once.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — For queue, visited, keys, and box tracking.

# Code

```typescript
function maxCandies(
    status: number[],
    candies: number[],
    keys: number[][],
    containedBoxes: number[][],
    initialBoxes: number[]
): number {
    const n = status.length;
    const visited = new Set<number>();
    const haveKey = new Set<number>();
    const seenBox = new Set<number>();
    let queue: number[] = [...initialBoxes];
    let totalCandies = 0;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const nextQueue: number[] = [];

        for (let box of queue) {
            if (visited.has(box)) continue;

            if (status[box] === 0 && !haveKey.has(box)) {
                seenBox.add(box);
                continue;
            }

            visited.add(box);
            totalCandies += candies[box];

            // Add newly obtained keys
            for (let key of keys[box]) {
                if (!haveKey.has(key)) {
                    haveKey.add(key);
                    if (seenBox.has(key)) {
                        nextQueue.push(key);
                        seenBox.delete(key);
                    }
                }
            }

            // Add contained boxes
            for (let contained of containedBoxes[box]) {
                nextQueue.push(contained);
            }
        }

        queue = nextQueue;
    }

    return totalCandies;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### **Example 1:**

```ts
status = [1,0,1,0]
candies = [7,5,4,100]
keys = [[],[],[1],[]]
containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]]
initialBoxes = [0]
```

**Step-by-step:**

* Start with box `0` → it's open → take 7 candies.
* Box `0` contains box `1` (closed) and `2` (open).
* Go to box `2` → open → take 4 candies, gain key to box `1`.
* Use key to open box `1` → take 5 candies, get box `3` (closed, no key).
* Can't open box `3` → stop.

**Total Candies: 7 + 4 + 5 = 16**

#### **Example 2:**

```ts
status = [1,0,0,0,0,0]
candies = [1,1,1,1,1,1]
keys = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]]
containedBoxes = [[1,2,3,4,5],[],[],[],[],[]]
initialBoxes = [0]
```

* Box `0` → open → 1 candy.
* Find boxes `1-5` and keys `1-5`.
* Use keys to open all boxes → collect 1 candy each.

**Total: 1 + 1\*5 = 6**

### **Summary:**

This solution leverages **BFS and state tracking** to simulate nested access and dynamic unlocking. It handles all constraints efficiently and scales well within the input bounds.
