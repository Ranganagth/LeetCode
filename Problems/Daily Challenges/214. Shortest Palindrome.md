[214. Shortest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-palindrome/)

# Intuition

To find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of a given string `s`, we need to determine the longest prefix of `s` that is already a palindrome. Once we know this prefix, we can reverse the remaining suffix and add it to the front of `s` to form the shortest palindrome.

The key insight is to use string manipulation and pattern matching to efficiently find this longest palindromic prefix.

# Approach

1. **Concatenate the string with its reverse**: Create a new string `combined` by concatenating `s` with its reverse, separated by a special character (e.g., `#`). This helps in avoiding any overlap between the two parts.
  
2. **Compute the KMP table**: Use the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm to find the longest prefix of `combined` that is also a suffix. This prefix-suffix match indicates the longest palindromic prefix of the original string `s`.

3. **Determine the shortest palindrome**: Using the length of this longest palindromic prefix, add the necessary characters (which are the reverse of the remaining suffix) to the front of `s`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string `s`. Constructing the `combined` string and computing the KMP table both take linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the KMP table and the combined string.

# Code

```typescript
function shortestPalindrome(s: string): string {
    const combined = s + "#" + s.split('').reverse().join('');
    const n = combined.length;

    const kmpTable = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1, j = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (j > 0 && combined[i] !== combined[j]) {
            j = kmpTable[j - 1];
        }
        if (combined[i] === combined[j]) {
            j++;
        }
        kmpTable[i] = j;
    }

    const longestPrefix = kmpTable[n - 1];
    
    const suffix = s.substring(longestPrefix).split('').reverse().join('');
    
    return suffix + s;
};

```

## Example usage

```typescript
console.log(shortestPalindrome("aacecaaa")); // Output: "aaacecaaa"
console.log(shortestPalindrome("abcd"));     // Output: "dcbabcd"
```

### Explanation of Examples

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `s = "aacecaaa"`
   - Combined string: `combined = "aacecaaa#aaacecaa"`
   - KMP table: The longest palindromic prefix length is 7.
   - Suffix to add: Reverse of the substring after the palindromic prefix, which is `""`.
   - Output: `"aaacecaaa"`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `s = "abcd"`
   - Combined string: `combined = "abcd#dcba"`
   - KMP table: The longest palindromic prefix length is 0.
   - Suffix to add: Reverse of the substring after the palindromic prefix, which is `"dcb"`.
   - Output: `"dcbabcd"`.
