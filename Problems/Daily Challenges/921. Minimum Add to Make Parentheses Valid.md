[921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/)

# Intuition

A string of parentheses is valid if every opening parenthesis `(` has a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. We need to determine how many moves are required to make a given parentheses string valid, where a move consists of inserting an opening or closing parenthesis at any position in the string.

We can think of this problem in terms of "imbalances":
- **Too many opening parentheses**: There are more `(` than `)` up to a certain point.
- **Too many closing parentheses**: There are more `)` than `(`.

The goal is to balance the string by counting how many additional opening or closing parentheses need to be added to fix these imbalances.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Counters**:
   - Use two counters: `openCount` to track how many opening parentheses `(` are currently unmatched, and `moves` to track how many moves (insertions) are needed.

2. **Iterate through the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it's an opening parenthesis `(`, increment `openCount` because we have an unmatched opening.
     - If it's a closing parenthesis `)`:
       - If `openCount` is greater than 0, it means we have a corresponding unmatched opening parenthesis, so decrement `openCount` to mark that we've matched an opening and closing.
       - If `openCount` is 0, it means there is no unmatched opening for this closing parenthesis, so increment `moves` because we need to insert an opening parenthesis to balance this closing.

3. **At the End**:
   - After processing the string, if there are still unmatched opening parentheses left (i.e., `openCount > 0`), we need to insert that many closing parentheses to balance them.
   - The final result is the sum of `moves` (insertions made during the iteration) and `openCount` (insertions required to balance any remaining unmatched opening parentheses).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string, since we iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a fixed amount of additional space (two counters).

# Code

```typescript
function minAddToMakeValid(s: string): number {
    let openCount: number = 0;
    let moves: number = 0;
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '(') {
            openCount++;
        } else {
            if (openCount > 0) {
                openCount--;
            } else {
                moves++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return moves + openCount;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
**Input**: `s = "())"`

- Step-by-step:
  - `(`: Increment `openCount` to 1.
  - `)`: Decrement `openCount` to 0 (matched).
  - `)`: No unmatched opening, increment `moves` to 1.

- After iteration: `openCount = 0`, `moves = 1`.

**Output**: `1` (We need to insert 1 opening parenthesis).

#### Example 2
**Input**: `s = "((("`

- Step-by-step:
  - `(`: Increment `openCount` to 1.
  - `(`: Increment `openCount` to 2.
  - `(`: Increment `openCount` to 3.

- After iteration: `openCount = 3`, `moves = 0`.

**Output**: `3` (We need to insert 3 closing parentheses).

### Explanation

The approach balances the string by counting unmatched parentheses and determining how many insertions are required to make the string valid. It ensures that the parentheses are correctly matched with a minimum number of moves.
