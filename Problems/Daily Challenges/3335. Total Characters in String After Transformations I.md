[3335. Total Characters in String After Transformations I](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-characters-in-string-after-transformations-i/)

# Intuition

The problem involves performing a series of transformations on a string where each character is replaced based on specific rules. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the length of the string after `t` transformations, especially since the string can grow exponentially when 'z' is transformed into "ab". Given the constraints, a brute-force approach of simulating each transformation step-by-step would be infeasible due to the potential exponential growth of the string length.

# Approach
1. **Track Character Counts**:
   - Instead of maintaining the entire string after each transformation, track the count of each character in the string. This allows us to compute the effect of transformations on the character counts without explicitly constructing the string at each step.

2. **Simulate Transformations**:
   - For each transformation, update the character counts based on the transformation rules:
     - 'z' transforms into "ab", increasing the count of 'a' and 'b' by the current count of 'z'.
     - Other characters transform into the next character in the alphabet, moving their counts to the next character.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be very large, apply modulo $10^9 + 7$ at each step to keep the numbers manageable.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - By focusing on character counts rather than the string itself, we reduce the complexity from exponential to linear in terms of the number of transformations and character types (26 letters).

# Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(t \cdot 26)$, where `t` is the number of transformations. Each transformation involves updating the counts of 26 characters.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(26)$, as we only need to maintain a constant-size array to track character counts.

# Code

```typescript
function stringTransformationLength(s: string, t: number): number {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    let counts = new Array(26).fill(0);
    
    // Initialize counts for each character in the original string
    for (const char of s) {
        const index = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        counts[index]++;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < t; i++) {
        const newCounts = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
            if (c === 25) { // 'z' case
                newCounts[0] = (newCounts[0] + counts[c]) % MOD; // 'a'
                newCounts[1] = (newCounts[1] + counts[c]) % MOD; // 'b'
            } else {
                newCounts[c + 1] = (newCounts[c + 1] + counts[c]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        counts = newCounts;
    }
    
    // Calculate the total length after t transformations
    let totalLength = 0;
    for (const count of counts) {
        totalLength = (totalLength + count) % MOD;
    }
    
    return totalLength;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Example 1**
```ts
Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2

Initial String: "abcyy"
Initial Length: 5
Initial Count of 'z': 0

First Transformation:
- 'a' → 'b'
- 'b' → 'c'
- 'c' → 'd'
- 'y' → 'z'
- 'y' → 'z'
New string: "bcdzz", New Length = 5, Count of 'z's = 2

Second Transformation:
- 'b' → 'c'
- 'c' → 'd'
- 'd' → 'e'
- 'z' → "ab" → +1 length (x2)
- 'z' → "ab" → +1 length (x2)
New string: "cdeabab", New Length = 7

Output: 7
```

#### **Example 2**
```ts
Input: s = "azbk", t = 1

Initial String: "azbk"
Initial Length: 4
Initial Count of 'z': 1

First Transformation:
- 'a' → 'b'
- 'z' → "ab" → +1 length
- 'b' → 'c'
- 'k' → 'l'
New string: "babcl", New Length = 5

Output: 5
```

### **Explanation**
1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by counting the occurrences of each character in the input string `s`.

2. **Transformations**:
   - For each transformation, we create a new array `newCounts` to store the updated counts.
   - For each character:
     - If the character is 'z' (index 25), we increment the counts of 'a' and 'b' (indices 0 and 1) by the count of 'z'.
     - For other characters, we move their counts to the next character in the alphabet.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - After each transformation, we apply modulo $10^9 + 7$ to the counts to prevent integer overflow.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After all transformations, the total length of the string is the sum of all character counts, again taken modulo $10^9 + 7$.

---
### **Summary**
- We efficiently calculated the string length without actually constructing the string.
- Handled exponential growth from `z` transformations by tracking and updating their count.
- The algorithm is optimal for large constraints $10^5$ with `O(t)` complexity.
