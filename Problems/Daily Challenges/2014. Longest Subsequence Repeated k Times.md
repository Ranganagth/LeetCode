[2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/)

# Intuition

We want to find the **longest subsequence `seq`** such that:
* Repeating `seq` exactly `k` times results in a sequence that is still a **subsequence of the input `s`**.
* Among all valid `seq`, return the **lexicographically largest** one.

To do this efficiently:
* Instead of trying all combinations blindly, **generate only viable candidate subsequences** from characters that appear **at least `k` times** (because otherwise `seq * k` cannot be formed).
* Use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**-like process to build longer candidates from smaller ones, layer by layer.
* **Prune the search space** early using the `isKRepeated` check to ensure we only keep expanding valid candidates.

# Approach

1. **Frequency Filtering**:
   * Count frequency of each character.
   * Only keep characters that appear at least `k` times — these are possible building blocks.

2. **Candidate Generation with BFS**:
   * Start with 1-character strings from the candidate pool.
   * Expand each string by appending another character from the same pool.
   * For each generated string `seq`, check if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Subsequence Validation (`isKRepeated`)**:
   * Simulate scanning `s`, trying to find `k` occurrences of `seq` in sequence.
   * If found, keep `seq` in the queue for further expansion.

4. **Track Best Answer**:
   * Maintain a global `ans` with the longest and lexicographically largest valid subsequence found so far.

# Complexity Analysis

Let:
* `n` = length of `s`
* `m` = number of candidate characters (at most 26 lowercase letters)

### Key Factors:

* **Candidate Pruning**:
  * Only expand strings made from characters with freq ≥ `k` — at most 26 characters.
  * This limits the branching factor significantly.

* **BFS Queue Growth**:
  * Each level of expansion increases string length by 1.
  * The practical upper limit on valid subsequence length is small (max is `Math.floor(s.length / k)`), so total number of generated candidates remains small in practice.

* **Subsequence Checking (`isKRepeated`)**:
  * Takes `O(n)` time per check (linear scan of `s`)

#### **Total Time:**
**`O(total_candidates * n)`**, which in practice remains efficient due to pruning.

# Code

```ts
function longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(s: string, k: number): string {
    const freq: Record<string, number> = {};
    for (const c of s) freq[c] = (freq[c] || 0) + 1;

    const candidate = Object.keys(freq)
        .filter((c) => freq[c] >= k)
        .sort()
        .reverse();

    const q: string[] = [...candidate];
    let ans = "";

    while (q.length > 0) {
        const curr = q.shift()!;
        if (curr.length > ans.length || (curr.length === ans.length && curr > ans)) {
            ans = curr;
        }

        for (const c of candidate) {
            const next = curr + c;
            if (isKRepeated(s, next, k)) q.push(next);
        }
    }

    return ans;
}

function isKRepeated(s: string, pattern: string, k: number): boolean {
    let i = 0,
        matched = 0;
    for (const c of s) {
        if (c === pattern[i]) {
            i++;
            if (i === pattern.length) {
                i = 0;
                matched++;
                if (matched === k) return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

### Input:

```ts
s = "letsleetcode", k = 2
```

* Candidate characters: `['l','t','e']`
* Possible valid subsequences: `let`, `ete`
* Output: `"let"` (as it's lexicographically larger)

---

### **Summary**

* **Optimized BFS** + **pruning** ensures we explore only valid paths.
* The solution avoids exponential explosion and runs efficiently for constraints up to `n = 2000`.
* Lexicographical control is naturally handled by sorting characters in descending order.
