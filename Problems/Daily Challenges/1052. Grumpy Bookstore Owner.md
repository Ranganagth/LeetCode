[1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/)

# Intuition

The goal is to maximize the number of satisfied customers in the bookstore by strategically using the secret technique for `minutes` consecutive minutes. To achieve this, we need to:
1. Determine the number of customers already satisfied without using the technique.
2. Find the optimal period of `minutes` where using the technique maximizes the additional satisfaction from otherwise grumpy minutes.

# Approach

1. **Calculate Base Satisfaction**: Sum up the number of customers for all the minutes where the owner is not grumpy.
2. **Sliding Window to Maximize Additional Satisfaction**: Use a sliding window of size `minutes` to calculate the number of additional customers that can be satisfied by using the technique on grumpy minutes. Track the maximum value of additional satisfaction during any such window.

### Steps:

1. Iterate through the `customers` array and calculate the `baseSatisfaction` for all the non-grumpy minutes.
2. Initialize a sliding window to capture the first `minutes` worth of additional satisfaction by summing up the customers during grumpy minutes within this window.
3. Slide the window across the array and update the additional satisfaction for each new window position by adding the new minute and removing the old minute.
4. Keep track of the maximum additional satisfaction observed.
5. Return the sum of `baseSatisfaction` and `maxAdditionalSatisfaction`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of elements in the `customers` array. This is because we traverse the array a few times: once for calculating the base satisfaction and once for the sliding window.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1***) as we only use a few extra variables for tracking sums and maximums.

# Code
```typescript
function maxSatisfied(customers: number[], grumpy: number[], minutes: number): number {
    const n = customers.length;

    let baseSatisfaction = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] === 0) {
            baseSatisfaction += customers[i];
        }
    }

    let additionalSatisfaction = 0;
    let maxAdditionalSatisfaction = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < minutes; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] === 1) {
            additionalSatisfaction += customers[i];
        }
    }

    maxAdditionalSatisfaction = additionalSatisfaction;

    for (let i = minutes; i < n; i++) {
        if (grumpy[i] === 1) {
            additionalSatisfaction += customers[i];
        }
        if (grumpy[i - minutes] === 1) {
            additionalSatisfaction -= customers[i - minutes];
        }
        maxAdditionalSatisfaction = Math.max(maxAdditionalSatisfaction, additionalSatisfaction);
    }

    return baseSatisfaction + maxAdditionalSatisfaction;
};

```

### Explanation

- **Base Satisfaction**: Calculate the number of customers already satisfied by summing up all non-grumpy minutes.
- **Sliding Window**: A sliding window approach is used to evaluate the impact of making `minutes` consecutive grumpy minutes into non-grumpy ones. This is done by adding the new grumpy minute's customers and removing the old grumpy minute's customers as the window slides.
- **Max Additional Satisfaction**: Track the maximum possible additional satisfied customers across all window positions.
- **Final Result**: Combine the base satisfaction and the maximum additional satisfaction to get the total number of satisfied customers.
