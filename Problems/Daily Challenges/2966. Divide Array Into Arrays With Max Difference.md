[2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/)

### Problem Overview

We are given:
* An integer array `nums` of size `n` (where `n` is divisible by 3).
* An integer `k`.

**Goal**:
Divide the array into `n / 3` groups of size 3 such that:
* The **difference between the max and min** in each group is **less than or equal to `k`**.

Return:
* A 2D array of valid groups, **or** an **empty array** if not possible.

---

# Intuition

To minimize the difference between elements in a group:
* Sort the array. This way, close elements are adjacent, and we can easily identify which groups may satisfy the condition.

Then:
* Traverse the sorted array in chunks of 3.
* For each chunk `[a, b, c]`, ensure `c - a <= k`.
* If any group fails this, it's **not possible** to divide the array as required.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort** the `nums` array.
2. **Iterate** through the array in steps of 3.
3. For each group of three consecutive elements:
   * Check if `max - min <= k`.
4. If all groups satisfy the condition, collect them.
5. Otherwise, return an empty array.

---
# Complexity

* **Time**: `O(n log n)` for sorting + `O(n)` for traversal → `O(n log n)`
* **Space**: `O(n)` for storing the result (or `O(1)` if in-place)

---
# Code

```ts
function divideArray(nums: number[], k: number): number[][] {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Step 1: Sort
    const result: number[][] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 3) {
        const group = [nums[i], nums[i + 1], nums[i + 2]];

        const min = group[0];
        const max = group[2];

        if (max - min > k) {
            return []; // Condition violated
        }

        result.push(group); // Valid group
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

**Input**: `nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1]`, `k = 2`
**Sorted**: `[1,1,3,3,4,5,7,8,9]`
Groups:

* `[1,1,3]`: OK (`3 - 1 = 2`)
* `[3,4,5]`: OK (`5 - 3 = 2`)
* `[7,8,9]`: OK (`9 - 7 = 2`)

Return: `[[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]`

#### Example 2

**Input**: `nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2]`, `k = 2`
**Sorted**: `[2,2,2,2,4,5]`
Groups:

* `[2,2,2]`: OK
* `[2,4,5]`: ❌ `5 - 2 = 3 > 2`

Return: `[]`

---

### Summary

This is a **greedy + sorting** problem:

* Sorting helps group close elements.
* Grouping in threes ensures the differences are minimized.
* Any violation in a group means the whole array can't be partitioned as required.

This solution is efficient for the input constraints ($n ≤ 10^5$).
