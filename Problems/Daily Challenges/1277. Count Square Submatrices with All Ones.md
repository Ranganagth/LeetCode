[1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/)

# Intuition
The task is to count all square submatrices that contain only `1`s in a binary matrix. This includes squares of different sizes. For any element in the matrix that is a `1`, it could be part of multiple square submatrices (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, etc.) if the surrounding elements are also `1`.

# Approach
A dynamic programming (DP) approach is efficient here. We’ll create a DP table to store the largest square side that ends at each cell `[i][j]`. This allows us to efficiently calculate the number of squares for the entire matrix by building up from smaller squares.

1. **Define a DP Table**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the size of the largest square that can end at cell `[i][j]` and contains all `1`s.
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` can form a square. Its size is `1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])`. This checks the left, top, and top-left cells to see if they can form a larger square.
   - If `matrix[i][j] == 0`, then `dp[i][j] = 0`.

2. **Count Squares**:
   - As we populate `dp[i][j]`, we can directly count the squares by summing all values in `dp`, as each `dp[i][j]` represents the number of squares with a bottom-right corner at that cell.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `matrix` has only `1`s or `0`s, handle it by summing values or directly returning `0`.
   - For a 1x1 matrix, return `1` if it contains a `1`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m × n)***, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns. We iterate through each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m × n)*** for the `dp` table, but it can be optimized to ***O(n)*** by only storing the current and previous row.

# Code:

```typescript
function countSquares(matrix: number[][]): number {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m }, () => new Array(n).fill(0));
    let totalSquares = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === 1) {
                if (i === 0 || j === 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                }
                totalSquares += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return totalSquares;
};

```

### Explanation of Code and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
Input:
```plaintext
matrix = [
  [0, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
]
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up a `dp` table with the same dimensions as `matrix`, initialized to `0`.
   - `totalSquares` is initially `0`.

2. **Iteration and DP Table Updates**:
   - For each cell `matrix[i][j]`, if it’s `1`:
     - If it’s on the first row or column, set `dp[i][j] = 1`.
     - Otherwise, compute `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1`.
   - Add `dp[i][j]` to `totalSquares` each time it’s updated.

3. **DP Table State and Result**:
   - Final `dp` table:
     ```
     0 1 1 1
     1 2 2 2
     0 1 2 3
     ```
   - Sum of all `dp` values = `15`.

4. **Output**: `15`

### Explanation of Results

Each `dp[i][j]` value represents the number of squares ending at that cell, allowing us to compute the final result by simply summing up all values in `dp`. This approach efficiently calculates all square submatrices with `1`s.
