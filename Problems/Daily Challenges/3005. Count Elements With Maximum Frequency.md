[3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-elements-with-maximum-frequency/)

# Intuition

We need to find:

1. The **maximum frequency** among all elements.
2. The **sum of frequencies** of all elements that occur with that maximum frequency.

Example:
`nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`

* Frequency map: `{1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}`
* Maximum frequency = 2
* Elements with frequency 2 → `1` and `2`
* Total frequency = `2 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) = 4`.

---

# Approach

1. Build a frequency map using a `Map<number, number>`.
2. Find the **maximum frequency** in the map.
3. Traverse the map again, summing up frequencies of elements whose frequency equals `maxFreq`.
4. Return the sum.

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n)` (two passes: one to build map, one to compute sum).
* **Space:** `O(n)` in worst case (all elements distinct).

# Code

```ts
function maxFrequencyElements(nums: number[]): number {
    const freq = new Map<number, number>();

    // Step 1: Build frequency map
    for (const num of nums) {
        freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Step 2: Find max frequency
    let maxFreq = 0;
    for (const count of freq.values()) {
        maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, count);
    }

    // Step 3: Sum all elements with max frequency
    let total = 0;
    for (const count of freq.values()) {
        if (count === maxFreq) {
            total += count;
        }
    }

    return total;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

Input:
`nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]`

* Frequency map → `{1:2, 2:2, 3:1, 4:1}`
* Max frequency = 2
* Elements with max freq → `1` and `2`
* Total frequency = `2 + 2 = 4`

Output: `4`

---

### Example 2

Input:
`nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

* Frequency map → `{1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1}`
* Max frequency = 1
* All 5 elements have max freq
* Total frequency = `1+1+1+1+1 = 5`

Output: `5`
