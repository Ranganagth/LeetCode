[650. 2 Keys Keyboard](https://leetcode.com/problems/2-keys-keyboard/)

# Intuition:

The key observation is that the problem can be reduced to **prime factorization** of the target number `n`. Each prime factor represents a sequence of operations needed to build up the number of 'A's.

- **Copy All** operation can be considered as an initialization step for a sequence.
- **Paste** operations are repeated to multiply the current number of 'A's.

By breaking down `n` into its prime factors, we can determine the optimal sequence of copy and paste operations required.

# Approach:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Factorize the number `n` into its prime factors.
   - For each prime factor `p`, it requires `p` operations (`1` Copy All and `p-1` Paste operations).

2. **Summation of Operations**:
   - Sum all the prime factors to get the minimum number of operations needed.

3. **Edge Case**:
   - If `n` is `1`, no operations are needed since we already have one 'A' on the screen.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(âˆšn)***, since we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of `n` for factorization.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code:

```typescript
function minSteps(n: number): number {
    if (n === 1) return 0;
    let result = 0;
    let factor = 2;
    while (n > 1) {
        while (n % factor === 0) {
            result += factor;
            n /= factor;
        }
        factor++;
        if (factor * factor > n) {
            if (n > 1) {
                result += n;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
};

```
## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(minSteps(3)); // Output: 3
console.log(minSteps(1)); // Output: 0
console.log(minSteps(5)); // Output: 5
console.log(minSteps(8)); // Output: 6
console.log(minSteps(9)); // Output: 6
```

### Explanation:

1. **Function `minSteps`**:
   - The function takes an integer `n` and returns the minimum number of operations required.
   - If `n` is `1`, it returns `0` since no operations are needed.
   - It initializes `result` to store the total operations and `factor` starting from `2`.

2. **Prime Factorization Loop**:
   - The outer `while` loop runs until `n` reduces to `1`.
   - The inner `while` loop checks if the current `factor` divides `n`.
     - If yes, it adds the `factor` to `result` and divides `n` by `factor`.
     - This continues until `n` is no longer divisible by `factor`.
   - After exiting the inner loop, `factor` is incremented to check for the next possible prime factor.

3. **Optimization**:
   - We optimize by breaking early if `factor * factor > n` since a larger factor than the square root of `n` means `n` itself is a prime number.
   - In that case, we add `n` to `result` and break the loop.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After the loops, `result` holds the minimum number of operations required, which is returned.

### Test Cases:

- **n = 3**:
  - Prime factors: 3
  - Operations: 3 (Copy All + Paste + Paste)
  
- **n = 1**:
  - Operations: 0 (Already have one 'A')
  
- **n = 5**:
  - Prime factors: 5
  - Operations: 5 (Copy All + 4 Pastes)
  
- **n = 8**:
  - Prime factors: 2, 2, 2
  - Operations: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6
  
- **n = 9**:
  - Prime factors: 3, 3
  - Operations: 3 + 3 = 6
