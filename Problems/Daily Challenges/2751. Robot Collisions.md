[2751. Robot Collisions](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-collisions/)

# Intuition:
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movements and collisions of robots on a line. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initialization**: Parse the input and pair each robot's position, health, and direction.
2. **Sorting**: Sort robots based on their positions since robots will collide when they meet at the same position.
3. **Simulate Movements and Collisions**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of robots moving to the right.
   - When a robot moving left encounters the stack (robots moving right), simulate the collision:
     - Compare healths of the colliding robots.
     - Adjust the health and decide which robot survives or if both are destroyed.
4. **Return Survivors**: Collect the health of surviving robots in the order they were given in the input.

# Approach:

1. **Sort** the robots by position.
2. **Use a Stack** for robots moving to the right.
3. **Simulate Collisions** when a left-moving robot meets robots in the stack.
4. **Collect Results** of surviving robots and map them back to their original indices for the final output.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: *O(n log n)* due to sorting, and *O(n)* for processing collisions, leading to ***O(n log n)*** overall.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing robots and the stack.

# Code:

```typescript
function simulateRobots(positions: number[], healths: number[], directions: string): number[] {
    let robots = positions.map((pos, index) => ({
        pos, 
        health: healths[index], 
        dir: directions[index],
        index
    })).sort((a, b) => a.pos - b.pos);
    
    let stack: { pos: number, health: number, dir: string, index: number }[] = [];
    let result: number[] = new Array(positions.length).fill(-1);

    for (let robot of robots) {
        if (robot.dir === 'R') {
            stack.push(robot);
        } else {
            while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1].dir === 'R') {
                let rightRobot = stack.pop();
                if (rightRobot.health > robot.health) {
                    rightRobot.health -= 1;
                    stack.push(rightRobot);
                    robot.health = 0;
                    break;
                } else if (rightRobot.health < robot.health) {
                    robot.health -= 1;
                    rightRobot.health = 0;
                } else {
                    robot.health = 0;
                    rightRobot.health = 0;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (robot.health > 0) {
                stack.push(robot);
            }
        }
    }

    for (let robot of stack) {
        result[robot.index] = robot.health;
    }

    return result.filter(health => health !== -1);
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: Each robot is represented as an object containing its position, health, direction, and original index.
2. **Sorting**: Robots are sorted by their position to process collisions in the correct order.
3. **Collision Handling**:
   - Robots moving to the right are pushed onto a stack.
   - For a left-moving robot, we simulate collisions with right-moving robots in the stack until no more collisions are possible or the stack is empty.
4. **Result Collection**: Surviving robots' healths are collected and mapped back to their original order based on their indices.
