[1925. Count Square Sum Triples](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-sum-triples/)

# Intuition

We need to count ordered triples `(a, b, c)` where:

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n
```

This means we are counting valid Pythagorean triples within the bound. Since `(a,b,c)` is ordered, `(3,4,5)` and `(4,3,5)` are considered different.

Brute force is acceptable because `n ≤ 250`, so checking all pairs is feasible.

# Approach

1. Loop `a` from `1` to `n`
2. Loop `b` from `1` to `n`
3. Compute `sum = a*a + b*b`
4. Check if `sum` is a perfect square.
5. If its square root `c` is an integer and `c ≤ n`, count it.

Perfect square check uses `Math.sqrt(sum)` and verifies if it’s an integer.

# Complexity

- **Time:** `O(n²)` since checking square root is constant-time.  
- **Space:** `O(1)`

---

# Code

```ts
function countTriples(n: number): number {
    let count = 0;

    for (let a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
        for (let b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
            const sum = a * a + b * b;
            const c = Math.sqrt(sum);
            if (Number.isInteger(c) && c <= n) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough  

**Input:**

```
n = 5
```

**Check pairs:**

| a | b | a²+b² | √(a²+b²) | Valid? |
|---|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 3 | 4 | 25 | 5 | yes |
| 4 | 3 | 25 | 5 | yes |

No other combinations satisfy the condition.

Total = `2`

**Output:** `2`
