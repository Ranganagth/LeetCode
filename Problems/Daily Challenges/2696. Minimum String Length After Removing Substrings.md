[2696. Minimum String Length After Removing Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-string-length-after-removing-substrings/)

# Intuition

We are given a string `s` that consists only of uppercase English letters. The task is to remove any occurrence of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from `s`, and we can keep performing this operation until no such substrings remain. The goal is to return the minimum possible length of the resulting string after all possible removals.

The key observation here is that every time we remove a pair like "AB" or "CD", the string shrinks, and new occurrences of these substrings might form as adjacent characters shift.

# Approach

1. **Stack-Based Approach**:
   - A stack is ideal for this problem because we can traverse through the string character by character and simulate the removal of substrings as soon as they are found.
   - We can push each character onto the stack unless we find a "AB" or "CD" pattern, in which case we pop the stack to simulate the removal.
   - The stack allows us to maintain the state of the string as we process each character, and the characters left in the stack at the end will represent the remaining string.

2. **Why a Stack Works**:
   - As we traverse the string, when we encounter a character that could form a part of "AB" or "CD", we check the previous character in the stack. If it forms "AB" or "CD", we remove both characters from the stack (simulating the removal of the substring).
   - If not, we push the current character onto the stack and continue.
   - This process efficiently handles the shrinking of the string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once, and each character is pushed or popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, because in the worst case, all characters are retained in the stack.

# Code:

```typescript
function minLength(s: string): number {
    const stack: string[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const curr = s[i];
        
        if (stack.length > 0) {
            const top = stack[stack.length - 1];
            if ((top === 'A' && curr === 'B') || (top === 'C' && curr === 'D')) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(curr);
            }
        } else {
            stack.push(curr);
        }
    }

    return stack.length;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize a Stack**: 
   - We initialize an empty stack to store the characters as we traverse through the string `s`.

2. **Traverse the String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the stack is not empty, we check if the current character along with the top character of the stack forms either "AB" or "CD".
     - If it does, we pop the top character from the stack, effectively removing the pair from the string.
     - Otherwise, we push the current character onto the stack.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing the entire string, the remaining characters in the stack represent the final string. The length of this stack gives the minimum possible length of the string.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `s = "ABFCACDB"`
  1. **Traverse the string**:
     - Stack: `[]`
     - Process "A": Stack: `['A']`
     - Process "B": Stack becomes empty (removed "AB")
     - Process "F": Stack: `['F']`
     - Process "C": Stack: `['F', 'C']`
     - Process "A": Stack: `['F', 'C', 'A']`
     - Process "C": Stack: `['F', 'C', 'A', 'C']`
     - Process "D": Stack becomes `['F', 'C', 'A']` (removed "CD")
     - Process "B": Stack: `['F', 'C', 'A', 'B']`
  2. The final stack is `['F', 'C']`, so the length is `2`.
  - **Output**: `2`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `s = "ACBBD"`
  1. **Traverse the string**:
     - Stack: `[]`
     - Process "A": Stack: `['A']`
     - Process "C": Stack: `['A', 'C']`
     - Process "B": Stack: `['A', 'C', 'B']`
     - Process "B": Stack: `['A', 'C', 'B', 'B']`
     - Process "D": Stack: `['A', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'D']`
  2. The final stack is `['A', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'D']`, so the length is `5`.
  - **Output**: `5`

### Conclusion

By using a stack, we efficiently simulate the removal of "AB" or "CD" substrings in a single pass through the string. The stack allows us to handle the shrinking of the string in ***O(n)*** time, and we can easily compute the minimum length of the resulting string after all possible operations. This approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient for the given constraints.
