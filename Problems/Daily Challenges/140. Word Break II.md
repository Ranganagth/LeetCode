[140. Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-25)

# Intuition
The problem can be approached using backtracking. We recursively try to split the string `s` at each possible position and check if the left part is a valid word in the dictionary. If it is, we recursively try to solve the rest of the string. To optimize, we use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - Use a helper function `backtrack` that takes a starting index and returns all possible sentences that can be formed from that index onward.
   - If the starting index reaches the end of the string, return an empty list indicating a valid path.
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.

2. **Checking Valid Words**:
   - For each starting index, iterate over possible end indices to form substrings.
   - If a substring is in the dictionary, recursively solve the remaining substring.
   - Combine the valid left part with results from recursive calls to form complete sentences.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)*** in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the string. The memoization helps to reduce the time complexity, but the worst-case scenario occurs when every substring is a valid word.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2^n)*** due to the space needed to store the results of all possible sentences.

# Code
```typescript
function wordBreak(s: string, wordDict: string[]): string[] {
    const wordSet = new Set(wordDict);
    const memo = new Map<number, string[]>();

    function backtrack(start: number): string[] {
        if (memo.has(start)) return memo.get(start)!;
        if (start === s.length) return [""];

        const result: string[] = [];

        for (let end = start + 1; end <= s.length; end++) {
            const word = s.substring(start, end);
            if (wordSet.has(word)) {
                const substrings = backtrack(end);
                for (const substring of substrings) {
                    result.push(word + (substring ? " " + substring : ""));
                }
            }
        }

        memo.set(start, result);
        return result;
    }

    return backtrack(0);
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**: A set `wordSet` is created for O(1) lookup of words in the dictionary.
- **Memoization**: A map `memo` is used to store the results of subproblems.
- **Backtracking Function `backtrack`**: This function recursively tries to split the string `s` from the given starting index. It checks all possible substrings starting from `start`, and if a substring is found in `wordSet`, it recursively processes the remaining string.
- **Combining Results**: The results from recursive calls are combined with the current valid word to form complete sentences.
- **Result**: The `wordBreak` function returns all possible sentences that can be formed from the input string using the given dictionary.
