[826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/)

# Intuition and Approach

1. **Sort Jobs by Difficulty**:
   - Sort the jobs based on their difficulty. If two jobs have the same difficulty, they are sorted by profit in descending order.

2. **Sort Workers by Ability**:
   - Sort the workers based on their abilities.

3. **Two Pointers Technique**:
   - Use two pointers or indices to keep track of the maximum profit job a worker can do based on their ability.
   - Iterate through the sorted workers and for each worker, determine the highest profit job they can perform by comparing their ability with the job difficulties.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Sort jobs by difficulty**:
   - Combine `difficulty` and `profit` into a list of tuples and sort them by difficulty.
  
2. **Sort workers**:
   - Sort the `worker` array.

3. **Iterate through Workers**:
   - Maintain a pointer or index for jobs.
   - For each worker, update the maximum profit they can achieve by considering all jobs up to their ability.
   - Accumulate the profit for each worker.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting `jobs` takes *O(n log n)*.
  - Sorting `worker` takes *O(m log m)*.
  - The while loop inside the worker iteration runs at most *O(n + m)*.

Thus, the overall time complexity is ***O(n log n + m log m)***.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** for the combined list of jobs, plus the space for sorting which is also ***O(n)***. 

# Code
```typescript
function maxProfitAssignment(difficulty: number[], profit: number[], worker: number[]): number {
    const jobs: [number, number][] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < difficulty.length; i++) {
        jobs.push([difficulty[i], profit[i]]);
    }

    jobs.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || b[1] - a[1]);

    worker.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let maxProfit = 0;
    let jobIndex = 0;
    let maxJobProfit = 0;
    let totalProfit = 0;

    for (const w of worker) {
        while (jobIndex < jobs.length && jobs[jobIndex][0] <= w) {
            maxJobProfit = Math.max(maxJobProfit, jobs[jobIndex][1]);
            jobIndex++;
        }
        totalProfit += maxJobProfit;
    }

    return totalProfit;
};

```
