[846. Hand of Straights](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)

# Intuition

The problem can be broken down into the following steps:
1. **Count Frequency**: Count the frequency of each card.
2. **Sort and Process**: Sort the cards and then try to form groups starting from the smallest card.
3. **Form Groups**: For each card, if it can be the start of a group, decrement the counts of the next `groupSize - 1` consecutive cards.
4. **Check Completeness**: If at any point, a required card to complete a group is not available in sufficient quantity, return false.

# Approach

1. **Count the Frequency**:
   - Use a map to count how many times each card appears in the hand.
   
2. **Sort the Cards**:
   - Sort the keys (card values) of the map to ensure we start forming groups from the smallest card.
   
3. **Form Groups**:
   - Iterate through the sorted keys, and for each card value, if it has a non-zero count, try to form a group starting from that card.
   - For each group, check if the next `groupSize - 1` consecutive cards have enough counts to form a group.
   - Decrement the counts for each card used in forming the group.
   
4. **Return Result**:
   - If all cards are used up properly in groups of `groupSize`, return true.
   - If at any point a group cannot be formed, return false.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting the cards.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the counts of the cards.

# Code
```typescript
function canArrangeHand(hand: number[], groupSize: number): boolean {
    if (hand.length % groupSize !== 0) {
        return false;
    }

    const countMap = new Map<number, number>();
    for (const card of hand) {
        countMap.set(card, (countMap.get(card) || 0) + 1);
    }

    const uniqueCards = Array.from(countMap.keys()).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    for (const card of uniqueCards) {
        const count = countMap.get(card);
        if (count > 0) {
            for (let i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                const currentCard = card + i;
                const currentCount = countMap.get(currentCard);
                if (currentCount === undefined || currentCount < count) {
                    return false;
                }
                countMap.set(currentCard, currentCount - count);
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
};

```

### Explanation

- **Counting Frequency**: We count the frequency of each card using a map.
- **Sorting**: We sort the card values to ensure we process the smallest cards first.
- **Forming Groups**: We iterate over the sorted cards and try to form groups of `groupSize` consecutive cards. For each card, we check if we can form a complete group and decrement the counts appropriately.
- **Result**: If we can form all required groups, we return true; otherwise, we return false.
