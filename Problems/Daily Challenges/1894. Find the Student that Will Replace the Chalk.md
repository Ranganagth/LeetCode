[1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-student-that-will-replace-the-chalk/)

# Intuition

The problem is about determining which student will run out of chalk when it's their turn. Given the constraints, a direct simulation might be inefficient, so we need to optimize the approach. The key observation here is that the process of students consuming chalk repeats cyclically. Therefore, we can optimize the solution by reducing the total chalk `k` modulo the sum of chalks used in one complete cycle. This reduction helps us avoid unnecessary full cycles and focus only on the remaining chalk that needs to be distributed.

# Approach

1. **Calculate the Total Chalk Used in One Cycle**: 
   - Compute the sum of all elements in the `chalk` array, which represents the total amount of chalk used in one full cycle of students.

2. **Reduce `k` Modulo Total Chalk**:
   - Reduce `k` by taking `k % totalChalk`. This gives us the effective amount of chalk remaining after removing full cycles.

3. **Find the Student Who Will Run Out of Chalk**:
   - Iterate through the students, subtracting the chalk they use from the reduced `k`. 
   - If at any student's turn, the remaining chalk is less than the chalk that student needs, that student will be the one who runs out of chalk.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of students. This is because we traverse the `chalk` array twice: once to calculate the total chalk and once to determine which student will run out.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a few extra variables, regardless of the size of the input.

# Code:

```typescript
function chalkReplacer(chalk: number[], k: number): number {
    const totalChalk = chalk.reduce((sum, chalkUsed) => sum + chalkUsed, 0);

    k %= totalChalk;

    for (let i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
        if (k < chalk[i]) {
            return i;
        }
        k -= chalk[i];
    }

    return -1;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(chalkReplacer([5, 1, 5], 22)); // Output: 0
console.log(chalkReplacer([3, 4, 1, 2], 25)); // Output: 1
```

### Explanation

1. **Total Chalk Calculation**: 
   - We calculate the sum of all the chalk values in the `chalk` array to find out how much chalk is used in a complete round through all students.

2. **Modulo Operation**: 
   - We then reduce `k` by taking the remainder when `k` is divided by the total chalk used in one cycle. This step essentially eliminates the need to simulate full cycles, which saves computational effort.

3. **Finding the Chalk Replacer**: 
   - We iterate through the students. For each student, we check if the remaining chalk `k` is less than the chalk needed by that student. If so, that student is identified as the one who will need to replace the chalk.
