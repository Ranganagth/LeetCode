[3011. Find if Array Can Be Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-if-array-can-be-sorted/)

# Intuition

The main idea here is to use bitwise counting to group numbers by the number of set bits (1's in binary representation). By iterating over these groups, we can ensure each group of numbers (with the same number of set bits) is sorted in non-decreasing order within the array. If each group’s maximum value is lower than the minimum of the next group, then it’s possible to sort the array under the given conditions.

# Approach

1. **Group by Set Bit Count**: As we iterate over the array, we use `bitCount` to count the number of set bits for each number.
  
2. **Track Min and Max for Each Group**:
   - For each group with the same set bit count, find the minimum and maximum elements within the group.
   - Compare the minimum of the current group with the maximum of the previous group. If the maximum of the previous group is greater than the minimum of the current group, sorting isn’t possible, so we return `false`.
  
3. **Update for Next Group**: After each group, update `previousMax` to the maximum value of the current group and move to the next set bit group.

4. **Return `true` If Sorted**: If no conflicts are found between group maximums and minimums, return `true` as sorting is feasible.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of `nums`. We iterate over the array once, and each operation inside the loop is constant-time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we’re only using a few variables to track group min/max values and don’t require additional data structures.

# Code

```typescript
function canSortArray(nums: number[]): boolean {
    let previousMax = -300; // Set initial previousMax to a low value outside the input range
    const length = nums.length;
  
    // Iterate through nums
    for (let i = 0; i < length; ) {
        let j = i + 1;
        const bitCountOfCurrent = bitCount(nums[i]); // Get bit count of current element
      
        // Track min and max within the current bit count group
        let minElement = nums[i];
        let maxElement = nums[i];
      
        // Continue within the group with same set bit count
        while (j < length && bitCount(nums[j]) === bitCountOfCurrent) {
            minElement = Math.min(minElement, nums[j]);
            maxElement = Math.max(maxElement, nums[j]);
            j++;
        }
      
        // If previous group's max is greater than current group's min, return false
        if (previousMax > minElement) {
            return false;
        }
      
        // Update previousMax for the next group
        previousMax = maxElement;
        i = j; // Move to the start of the next group
    }
  
    return true;
};

function bitCount(i: number): number {
    // Efficient bit manipulation to count the bits set to 1
    i = i - ((i >>> 1) & 0x55555555);
    i = (i & 0x33333333) + ((i >>> 2) & 0x33333333);
    i = (i + (i >>> 4)) & 0x0f0f0f0f;
    i = i + (i >>> 8);
    i = i + (i >>> 16);
    return i & 0x3f;
};

```

## Example usage

```typescript
console.log(canSortArray([8, 4, 2, 30, 15])); // Output: true
console.log(canSortArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));   // Output: true
console.log(canSortArray([3, 16, 8, 4, 2]));  // Output: false
console.log(canSortArray([75, 34, 30]));      // Output: false
```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example:

**Example Input**: `nums = [75, 34, 30]`

1. **Count Set Bits**:
   - `75` has 4 set bits (binary `1001011`).
   - `34` has 2 set bits (binary `100010`).
   - `30` has 4 set bits (binary `11110`).

2. **Group Processing**:
   - Start with `i = 0`, where `nums[i] = 75`, with 4 set bits. Initialize `minElement = 75` and `maxElement = 75`.
   - Move to `j = 1` (`nums[1] = 34`), which has 2 set bits. This is a new group, so we compare:
     - `previousMax = -300` (initial value) with `minElement = 75` — no issue here.
   - Update `previousMax` to `maxElement = 75`, and move to `i = 1`.

3. **Next Group**:
   - At `i = 1`, `nums[i] = 34`, with 2 set bits. Initialize `minElement = 34` and `maxElement = 34`.
   - Move to `j = 2` (`nums[2] = 30`), which has 4 set bits, indicating a new group. Compare:
     - `previousMax = 75` with `minElement = 34` — here, `75 > 34`, which violates the sorting rule.

4. **Conclusion**: Since `previousMax` is greater than `minElement` in the next group, we return `false`.

### Explanation of `bitCount` Function

The `bitCount` function efficiently counts the number of set bits (1's) in a binary number using bit manipulation. This method is faster than repeatedly dividing by two or checking individual bits manually, especially for larger inputs.
