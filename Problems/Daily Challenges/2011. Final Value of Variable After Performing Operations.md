[2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

# Intuition

You are given a list of operations that modify a single integer variable `X`, starting from `0`.
Each operation is one of four types:

* `"++X"` → Increment before usage → `X = X + 1`
* `"X++"` → Increment after usage → `X = X + 1`
* `"--X"` → Decrement before usage → `X = X - 1`
* `"X--"` → Decrement after usage → `X = X - 1`

Since **the "before" or "after" doesn't matter** in this problem (we only care about the final value of X, not expression evaluation), both increment forms add +1, and both decrement forms subtract 1.

So we just count how many increments and decrements occur.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize `X = 0`.
2. Loop through every string in `operations`.
3. If the string contains `'+'`, increment `X` by 1.
4. Otherwise, decrement `X` by 1.
5. Return `X`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` — where `n` is the number of operations.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` — only a single integer variable is used.

# Code

```typescript
function finalValueAfterOperations(operations: string[]): number {
  let X = 0;

  for (const op of operations) {
    if (op.includes('+')) {
      X++;
    } else {
      X--;
    }
  }

  return X;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
```

| Step | Operation | Effect | X  |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | -- |
| 1    | "--X"     | -1     | -1 |
| 2    | "X++"     | +1     | 0  |
| 3    | "X++"     | +1     | 1  |

**Output → 1**

### Example 2

```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
```

| Step | Operation | Effect | X |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | - |
| 1    | "++X"     | +1     | 1 |
| 2    | "++X"     | +1     | 2 |
| 3    | "X++"     | +1     | 3 |

**Output → 3**

### Example 3

```
Input: operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]
```

| Step | Operation | Effect | X |
| ---- | --------- | ------ | - |
| 1    | "X++"     | +1     | 1 |
| 2    | "++X"     | +1     | 2 |
| 3    | "--X"     | -1     | 1 |
| 4    | "X--"     | -1     | 0 |

**Output → 0**

**Final Answer:**

* Simple, linear-time solution using one loop.
* Works for all 4 operation types uniformly.
