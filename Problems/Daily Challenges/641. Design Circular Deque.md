[641. Design Circular Deque](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-circular-deque/)

# Intuition:

The circular deque is a queue-like data structure where elements can be inserted and removed from both the front and the rear. It operates in a circular fashion, which means when the rear reaches the end of the deque, it wraps around to the beginning.

# Approach:

We can implement the circular deque using a fixed-size array. The key is to maintain two pointers, `front` and `rear`, that point to the current positions for inserting or removing elements. We also maintain a `count` variable to keep track of the current size of the deque.

1. **`insertFront`**: This inserts an element at the front of the deque. The `front` pointer needs to be adjusted circularly (move backward).
2. **`insertLast`**: This inserts an element at the rear of the deque. The `rear` pointer needs to be adjusted circularly (move forward).
3. **`deleteFront`**: This removes the front element and adjusts the `front` pointer circularly.
4. **`deleteLast`**: This removes the rear element and adjusts the `rear` pointer circularly.
5. **`getFront`**: Retrieves the element at the front.
6. **`getRear`**: Retrieves the element at the rear.
7. **`isEmpty`**: Returns `true` if the deque is empty, otherwise `false`.
8. **`isFull`**: Returns `true` if the deque is full, otherwise `false`.

The circular nature is handled by calculating the new positions for `front` and `rear` using modulo arithmetic. 

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:**
  - All operations (`insertFront`, `insertLast`, `deleteFront`, `deleteLast`, `getFront`, `getRear`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`) take constant time ***O(1)*** because they involve only pointer manipulation and direct access to elements.
  
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - ***O(k)*** where `k` is the size of the deque, as we use an array of size `k`.

# Code:

```typescript
class MyCircularDeque {
    private deque: number[];
    private front: number;
    private rear: number;
    private capacity: number;
    private count: number;

    constructor(k: number) {
        this.capacity = k;
        this.deque = new Array(k).fill(-1);
        this.front = 0;
        this.rear = 0;
        this.count = 0;
    }

    insertFront(value: number): boolean {
        if (this.isFull()) {
            return false;
        }
        this.front = (this.front - 1 + this.capacity) % this.capacity;
        this.deque[this.front] = value;
        this.count++;
        return true;
    }

    insertLast(value: number): boolean {
        if (this.isFull()) {
            return false;
        }
        this.deque[this.rear] = value;
        this.rear = (this.rear + 1) % this.capacity;
        this.count++;
        return true;
    }

    deleteFront(): boolean {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        this.front = (this.front + 1) % this.capacity;
        this.count--;
        return true;
    }

    deleteLast(): boolean {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        this.rear = (this.rear - 1 + this.capacity) % this.capacity;
        this.count--;
        return true;
    }

    getFront(): number {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        return this.deque[this.front];
    }

    getRear(): number {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        return this.deque[(this.rear - 1 + this.capacity) % this.capacity];
    }

    isEmpty(): boolean {
        return this.count === 0;
    }

    isFull(): boolean {
        return this.count === this.capacity;
    }
};


/**
 * Your MyCircularDeque object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new MyCircularDeque(k)
 * var param_1 = obj.insertFront(value)
 * var param_2 = obj.insertLast(value)
 * var param_3 = obj.deleteFront()
 * var param_4 = obj.deleteLast()
 * var param_5 = obj.getFront()
 * var param_6 = obj.getRear()
 * var param_7 = obj.isEmpty()
 * var param_8 = obj.isFull()
 */
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the deque with a fixed capacity `k` and set both `front` and `rear` pointers to 0. The deque is initially empty, so `count` is set to 0.

2. **insertFront(value: number)**: We decrement the `front` pointer circularly using `(front - 1 + capacity) % capacity` and place the value at this new position. If the deque is full, the operation fails.

3. **insertLast(value: number)**: We place the value at the current `rear` pointer and move the `rear` pointer forward circularly using `(rear + 1) % capacity`.

4. **deleteFront()**: We increment the `front` pointer circularly to remove the front element.

5. **deleteLast()**: We decrement the `rear` pointer circularly to remove the last element.

6. **getFront()**: We return the element at the `front` pointer unless the deque is empty.

7. **getRear()**: We return the element just before the `rear` pointer, adjusting for circular behavior.

8. **isEmpty()**: Returns `true` if `count` is 0.

9. **isFull()**: Returns `true` if `count` is equal to the capacity.

### Example Walkthrough:

```typescript
const myCircularDeque = new MyCircularDeque(3);

myCircularDeque.insertLast(1);  // Returns true
myCircularDeque.insertLast(2);  // Returns true
myCircularDeque.insertFront(3); // Returns true
myCircularDeque.insertFront(4); // Returns false, because the deque is full
myCircularDeque.getRear();      // Returns 2
myCircularDeque.isFull();       // Returns true
myCircularDeque.deleteLast();   // Returns true
myCircularDeque.insertFront(4); // Returns true
myCircularDeque.getFront();     // Returns 4
```

### Breakdown of Operations:

1. **Insert `1` at the rear**: The rear pointer is at 0, so `1` is placed in `deque[0]`, and the rear moves to 1. Now, the deque contains `[1, -1, -1]`.
   
2. **Insert `2` at the rear**: The rear pointer is at 1, so `2` is placed in `deque[1]`, and the rear moves to 2. The deque becomes `[1, 2, -1]`.
   
3. **Insert `3` at the front**: The front pointer is at 0, and we move it backward circularly to 2. So, `3` is placed in `deque[2]`, and the deque becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
   
4. **Try to insert `4` at the front**: The deque is full (`count = 3`), so this operation returns `false`.
   
5. **Get the rear element**: The rear pointer is at 2, so the rear element is at `deque[1]`, which is `2`.

6. **Check if full**: The deque is full, so this returns `true`.

7. **Delete the rear element**: The rear pointer is at 2, and moving backward circularly brings it to 1. Now, the deque becomes `[1, -1, 3]`.

8. **Insert `4` at the front**: The front pointer is at 2, so moving backward brings it to 1. Now, the deque becomes `[1, 4, 3]`.

9. **Get the front element**: The front pointer is at 1, so the front element is `4`.
