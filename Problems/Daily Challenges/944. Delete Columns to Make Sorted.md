[944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted/)

# Intuition

Each column is independent.
A column is valid if its characters, read top to bottom, are in non-decreasing lexicographical order.
If any adjacent pair in a column violates this order, that column must be deleted.

So the task reduces to:
For every column index `j`, check whether `strs[i][j] <= strs[i+1][j]` for all rows `i`.

---

# Approach

1. Let `rows = strs.length`, `cols = strs[0].length`.
2. Initialize `deleted = 0`.
3. For each column `j` from `0` to `cols - 1`:

   * For each row `i` from `0` to `rows - 2`:

     * If `strs[i][j] > strs[i + 1][j]`:

       * Increment `deleted`.
       * Stop checking this column (break).
4. Return `deleted`.

Each column is scanned once until it fails or finishes.

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n * m)`
  where `n = number of strings`, `m = length of each string`
* **Space:** `O(1)`
  only counters are used

# Code

```ts
function minDeletionSize(strs: string[]): number {
    const rows = strs.length;
    const cols = strs[0].length;
    let deleted = 0;

    for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < rows - 1; i++) {
            if (strs[i][j] > strs[i + 1][j]) {
                deleted++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return deleted;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:**

```
strs = ["cba", "daf", "ghi"]

Grid:
c b a
d a f
g h i
```

* Column 0: `c ≤ d ≤ g` → sorted
* Column 1: `b > a` → not sorted → delete
* Column 2: `a ≤ f ≤ i` → sorted

Deleted columns = **1**

## Key Insight

This problem is purely **column-wise validation**.
No sorting, no data structures—just direct comparison.
