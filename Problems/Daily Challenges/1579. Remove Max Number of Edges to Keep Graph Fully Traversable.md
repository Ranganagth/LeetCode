[1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-max-number-of-edges-to-keep-graph-fully-traversable/)

# Intuition
The problem involves finding the maximum number of edges that can be removed from an undirected graph while ensuring that both Alice and Bob can still traverse the entire graph. This requires checking if the graph remains fully connected for both Alice and Bob after removing unnecessary edges.

# Approach
1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage the connected components of the graph. This helps in efficiently checking whether two nodes are in the same connected component and merging two components.
2. **Process Type 3 Edges First**: These edges can be used by both Alice and Bob. Therefore, they should be considered first to maximize their shared utility. This helps in reducing the problem to simpler components.
3. **Process Type 1 and Type 2 Edges**: After handling type 3 edges, separately process type 1 (for Alice) and type 2 (for Bob) edges. This ensures that both Alice and Bob have their respective graphs connected.
4. **Check Connectivity**: Finally, check if both Alice's and Bob's graphs are fully connected using the Union-Find structure. If not, return -1 as it's impossible to ensure full traversal for either Alice or Bob.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(E log N)***, where *E* is the number of edges and *N* is the number of nodes. The complexity is dominated by the union and find operations, which are almost constant due to path compression and union by rank.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(N)*** for storing the parent and rank arrays in the Union-Find structure.

# Code

```typescript
type UnionFind = {
    parents: number[];
    sizes: number[];
    count: number;
};

function createUnionFind(n: number): UnionFind {
    const parents = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, index) => index);
    const sizes = new Array(n).fill(1);
    return { parents, sizes, count: n };
}

function find(unionFind: UnionFind, x: number): number {
    if (unionFind.parents[x] !== x) {
        unionFind.parents[x] = find(unionFind, unionFind.parents[x]);
    }
    return unionFind.parents[x];
}

function unite(unionFind: UnionFind, a: number, b: number): boolean {
    let parentA = find(unionFind, a - 1);
    let parentB = find(unionFind, b - 1);
    if (parentA === parentB) {
        return false;
    }
    if (unionFind.sizes[parentA] > unionFind.sizes[parentB]) {
        unionFind.parents[parentB] = parentA;
        unionFind.sizes[parentA] += unionFind.sizes[parentB];
    } else {
        unionFind.parents[parentA] = parentB;
        unionFind.sizes[parentB] += unionFind.sizes[parentA];
    }
    unionFind.count--;
    return true;
}

function maxNumEdgesToRemove(n: number, edges: number[][]): number {
    let ufa = createUnionFind(n);
    let ufb = createUnionFind(n);
    let removalCount = 0;

    for (let edge of edges) {
        if (edge[0] === 3) {
            let unitedA = unite(ufa, edge[1], edge[2]);
            unite(ufb, edge[1], edge[2]);
            if (!unitedA) {
                removalCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    for (let edge of edges) {
        let type = edge[0], u = edge[1], v = edge[2];
        if (type === 1) {
            removalCount += !unite(ufa, u, v) ? 1 : 0;
        } else if (type === 2) {
            removalCount += !unite(ufb, u, v) ? 1 : 0;
        }
    }

    if (ufa.count === 1 && ufb.count === 1) {
        return removalCount;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
};

```

### Explanation of Example Outputs
1. **First Example**:
   - Two edges ([1,1,2] and [1,1,3]) can be removed while keeping the graph fully traversable for both Alice and Bob.
2. **Second Example**:
   - No edges can be removed without disconnecting the graph.
3. **Third Example**:
   - It's impossible to keep the graph connected for both Alice and Bob, thus returning -1.
