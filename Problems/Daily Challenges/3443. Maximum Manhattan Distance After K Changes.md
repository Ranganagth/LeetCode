[3443. Maximum Manhattan Distance After K Changes](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-manhattan-distance-after-k-changes/)

### Problem: Max Manhattan Distance with Direction Changes

Given a sequence of directional moves on an infinite grid, where you're allowed to **change up to `k` of the directions**, find the **maximum Manhattan distance** from the origin (0, 0) you can achieve **at any time** during the traversal.

---

# Intuition

You follow the sequence `s` one move at a time:
- Update your position using a pair of coordinates `(latitude, longitude)`
- At each step, compute:
  - Your current Manhattan distance from the origin: `|latitude| + |longitude|`
  - What's the maximum distance you **could** reach if you changed **up to `k` of the previous moves**
- You want to maximize this potential distance **at any step `i`**

Why does `+ k * 2` make sense?
- A direction change can increase Manhattan distance by at most `2` (e.g., changing a move that brings you closer into one that goes further).

---

# Approach

1. Traverse the string `s` and simulate the position `(latitude, longitude)`:
   - 'N' increases latitude
   - 'S' decreases latitude
   - 'E' increases longitude
   - 'W' decreases longitude
2. After each step `i`, calculate:
   - `current_distance = |latitude| + |longitude|`
   - `max_distance_at_i = min(current_distance + 2*k, i + 1)`
     - `i + 1` is the total number of steps taken so far
     - You can’t exceed total steps with any amount of optimization
3. Track the maximum of all these values.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` – we traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` – constant space for counters and position tracking.

# Code

```ts
function maxDistance(s: string, k: number): number {
    let latitude = 0, longitude = 0, ans = 0;
    const n = s.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        switch (s[i]) {
            case 'N':
                latitude++;
                break;
            case 'S':
                latitude--;
                break;
            case 'E':
                longitude++;
                break;
            case 'W':
                longitude--;
                break;
        }

        const currentDistance = Math.abs(latitude) + Math.abs(longitude);
        const maxDistance = Math.min(currentDistance + 2 * k, i + 1);
        ans = Math.max(ans, maxDistance);
    }

    return ans;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### Input: `s = "NWSE"`, `k = 1`

Steps:

| Step | Move | Position      | Distance | Potential Max |
|------|------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| 1    | N    | (0, 1)        | 1        | min(1 + 2, 1) = 1 |
| 2    | W    | (-1, 1)       | 2        | min(2 + 2, 2) = 2 |
| 3    | S    | (-1, 0)       | 1        | min(1 + 2, 3) = 3 |
| 4    | E    | (0, 0)        | 0        | min(0 + 2, 4) = 2 |

**Answer:** 3 (at step 3)

## **Summary**

- The trick lies in recognizing that each changed move can increase the distance by up to 2.
- We compute the potential max distance at every step and return the best.
- Efficient, simple, and works within constraints.
