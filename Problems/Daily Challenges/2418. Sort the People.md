[2418. Sort the People](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-the-people/)

# Intuition
The problem involves sorting names based on their corresponding heights in descending order. Given that both `names` and `heights` arrays are of the same length and have a one-to-one correspondence, the solution involves pairing each name with its height, sorting these pairs by height in descending order, and then extracting the names in the new order.

# Approach
1. **Pairing Names with Heights**: Create a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and its corresponding height.
2. **Sorting the List**: Sort this list of tuples based on the height in descending order.
3. **Extracting Sorted Names**: After sorting, extract the names from the sorted list to get the desired order.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, where *n* is the number of elements in the input arrays. This is primarily due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, as we are storing the combined list of tuples and the final list of sorted names.

# Code

```typescript
function sortPeople(names: string[], heights: number[]): string[] {
    const people: [string, number][] = names.map((name, index) => [name, heights[index]]);
    
    people.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
    
    const sortedNames = people.map(person => person[0]);
    
    return sortedNames;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
const names1 = ["Mary", "John", "Emma"];
const heights1 = [180, 165, 170];
console.log(sortPeople(names1, heights1)); // Output: ["Mary", "Emma", "John"]

const names2 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Bob"];
const heights2 = [155, 185, 150];
console.log(sortPeople(names2, heights2)); // Output: ["Bob", "Alice", "Bob"]
```

### Explanation
1. **Combining Arrays**:
   ```typescript
   const people: [string, number][] = names.map((name, index) => [name, heights[index]]);
   ```
   This step creates an array `people` where each element is a tuple containing a name and the corresponding height.

2. **Sorting**:
   ```typescript
   people.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
   ```
   The sort function uses a comparator that sorts by the second element of the tuples (the heights) in descending order.

3. **Extracting Names**:
   ```typescript
   const sortedNames = people.map(person => person[0]);
   ```
   This step maps the sorted `people` array back to an array of names, now in the order of descending heights.
