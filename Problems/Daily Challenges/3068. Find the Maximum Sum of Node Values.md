[3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-sum-of-node-values/)
# Intuition 
1. **Understanding XOR Impact**:
    - When you XOR a number with 𝑘k, it either increases or decreases its value depending on the bits in 𝑘k. Specifically, the operation nums[𝑖]=nums[𝑖] XOR 𝑘nums[i]=nums[i]XORk changes the bits of the number and affects its overall value.
2. **Maximizing Sum**:
    - We need to decide for each node whether to XOR it with 𝑘k to maximize the overall sum of the tree. To do this efficiently, we look at the "gain" from XORing each node, which can be positive or negative.

# Approach
1. **Calculate Gains**: 
   - Compute the difference for each node if it were XORed with \( k \), and store these differences in the `delta` array. This tells us how much each node's value would change if we performed the XOR operation.

2. **Sort the Gains**:
   - Sort the `delta` array in descending order. This helps us to prioritize nodes that would benefit the most from the XOR operation.

3. **Calculate Maximum Sum**:
   - Initialize the sum with the current sum of `nums`.
   - Iterate through the sorted `delta` array in pairs. If the sum of a pair is positive, it means performing XOR on both nodes in the pair increases the overall sum, so add this sum to the result.

# Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Calculating the `delta` array takes ***O(n)*** time.
  - Sorting the `delta` array takes ***O(n log n)*** time.
  - Summing the values and iterating through them takes ***O(n)*** time.
  - Overall time complexity remains ***O(n log n)***.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** due to the storage of the `delta` array.

# Code
```typescript
function maximumValueSum(nums: number[], k: number, edges: number[][]): number {
    const delta = nums.map(n => (n ^ k) - n).sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let res = nums.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);

    for (let i = 0; i + 1 < delta.length; i += 2) {
        const sum = delta[i] + delta[i + 1];
        if (sum > 0) res += sum;
    }

    return res;
};

```

> This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and straightforward, leveraging the inherent properties of XOR operations and sorting to maximize the sum of node values in the tree.
