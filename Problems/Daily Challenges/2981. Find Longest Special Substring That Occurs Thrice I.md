[2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-longest-special-substring-that-occurs-thrice-i/)

# Intuition:

A "special substring" is made up of only one character repeated multiple times. To solve this problem:
1. We aim to find the longest such substring that appears at least three times in `s`.
2. Since a substring is contiguous, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently check substrings of increasing lengths.
3. We leverage a hash map to store counts of substrings and efficiently identify those appearing at least three times.

# Approach:

1. **Definition of Substrings**:
    - Generate all substrings of increasing lengths, starting from the longest possible.
    - Check each substring for being "special" (all characters identical).
2. **Hash Map for Frequency Count**:
    - Use a hash map to count occurrences of each valid special substring.
    - For each substring, ensure that all characters are the same (validate its "special" status).
3. **Sliding Window for Optimization**:
    - Use a sliding window to extract substrings of a fixed length.
    - Check if the substring is "special" (all characters are the same) and update its count in the hash map.
4. **Search for the Longest Valid Substring**:    
    - Start with the maximum possible length (based on string size).
    - Stop once we find a substring length that occurs at least three times, or return -1 if none exist.

# **Complexity Analysis**:

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Outer loop for substring lengths: *O(n)*.
    - Inner loop for sliding window: *O(n)*.
    - Validation for special substring: *O(1)* (all characters in the substring are checked in linear time per window size).
    - Total: ***O(n²)***, as we iterate over all substrings.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - Hash map for substring counts: ***O(n²)*** in the worst case, if all substrings are unique.

# Code:

```typescript
function maximumLength(s: string): number {
    const n = s.length;
    let maxLength = -1;

    // Iterate over substring lengths from largest to smallest
    for (let len = n; len >= 1; len--) {
        const freq = new Map<string, number>();

        // Sliding window to extract substrings of length `len`
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            const sub = s.slice(i, i + len);

            // Check if the substring is special (all characters the same)
            if (new Set(sub).size === 1) {
                freq.set(sub, (freq.get(sub) || 0) + 1);
                if (freq.get(sub) >= 3) {
                    maxLength = len;
                    return maxLength; // Found the longest substring
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**:

#### **Example 1**:

**Input**:
```typescript
s = "aaaa";
```

**Execution**:
- Substring lengths: Try `len = 4`, `len = 3`, `len = 2`, and `len = 1`.
    - For `len = 2`: Substrings are `"aa"`, `"aa"`, and `"aa"`. All are valid and appear at least thrice.
- Maximum length is `2`.

**Output**:
```typescript
2
```

#### **Example 2**:

**Input**:
```typescript
s = "abcdef";
```

**Execution**:
- Substring lengths: All substrings have no repeated characters.
- No valid substring found.

**Output**:
```typescript
-1
```

#### **Example 3**:

**Input**:
```typescript
s = "abcaba";
```

**Execution**:
- Substring lengths:
    - For `len = 1`: Substrings `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"a"`, `"b"`, `"a"`.
        - `"a"` appears three times. Maximum length is `1`.

**Output**:
```typescript
1
```

### **Key Insights**:

- The problem reduces to finding the longest special substring efficiently with a sliding window and frequency count.
- Checking "special" status using `Set` ensures correctness without unnecessary complexity.
