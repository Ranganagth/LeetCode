[3403. Find the Lexicographically Largest String From the Box I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-lexicographically-largest-string-from-the-box-i/)

# Intuition

The goal is to split the `word` into exactly `numFriends` non-empty parts **in all possible unique ways**, and collect **all substrings** resulting from every split across rounds. From all these substrings, we need to return the **lexicographically largest** one.

However, generating all possible splits would be too slow (combinatorial explosion) for input size up to 5000. Instead, the trick is to realize:

* In each unique split, every possible substring is from a **prefix of `word`**.
* The largest possible lexicographic string we can get from **any split** is a substring of `word`.

The problem then reduces to **finding the lexicographically largest substring** of `word` that is **at most `word.length - numFriends + 1` characters long** (this is the maximum possible length a part can take in any valid split).

# Approach

This uses a **variant of Duval’s algorithm** to find the **lexicographically largest substring** of the word.

#### Breakdown:

* The variable `m = word.length - numFriends + 1` is the maximum allowed length of any part in any valid split.
* Duval’s algorithm walks through the string using two pointers `i` and `j` to find the start index `i` of the largest lexicographical suffix.
* Once the best suffix starting at `i` is found, the substring from `i` to end is returned, capped at length `m`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` – Each character is compared at most twice.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` – Constant extra space is used (besides input and output).

# Code

```typescript
function answerString(word: string, numFriends: number): string {
    if (numFriends === 1) {
        return word; // whole word is one part
    }

    const n = word.length;
    const m = n - numFriends + 1; // maximum allowed length of a part

    let i = 0, j = 1;

    // Duval's algorithm variation to find lex greatest suffix
    while (j < n) {
        let k = 0;

        // Compare characters starting from i and j
        while (j + k < n && word.charAt(i + k) === word.charAt(j + k)) {
            k++;
        }

        if (j + k < n && word.charAt(i + k) < word.charAt(j + k)) {
            // Found a better suffix starting at j
            const temp = i;
            i = j;
            j = Math.max(j + 1, temp + k + 1);
        } else {
            j += k + 1;
        }
    }

    const result = word.substring(i);
    return result.length <= m ? result : result.substring(0, m);
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### **Example 1:**

```ts
Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2
```

* `m = 4 - 2 + 1 = 3`
* All possible unique splits:

  * "d", "bca"
  * "db", "ca"
  * "dbc", "a"
* All parts collected: "d", "bca", "db", "ca", "dbc", "a"
* Largest string: `"dbc"`

**Output:** `"dbc"`

#### **Example 2:**

```ts
Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4
```

* `m = 4 - 4 + 1 = 1`
* Only valid split: "g", "g", "g", "g"
* Max length allowed: 1
* All parts: just `"g"`

**Output:** `"g"`

### **Summary:**

By reducing the problem to finding the **largest lexicographical suffix**, and constraining its length, we avoid brute-force enumeration and achieve an optimal linear-time solution using a clever pointer-based comparison strategy.
