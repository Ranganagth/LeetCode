[2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-square-streak-in-an-array/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to find a subsequence where each element is the square of the previous one after sorting. This is akin to forming a "square chain" where, given a starting number, each subsequent number must be the square of the preceding one.

# Approach

1. **Filter and Sort**:
   - First, sort `nums` in ascending order. Sorting helps identify potential square chains easily since each element should appear before its square in the sequence.

2. **Use a Set for Quick Lookup**:
   - Convert the sorted array into a set to allow quick lookup of potential squares (this enables `O(1)` average lookup time).
   
3. **Find the Longest Square Streak**:
   - Iterate through each number in the sorted list and attempt to form a square streak:
     - For each number `num`, attempt to find a sequence where the next element in the streak is `num^2`.
     - Keep squaring the current number and checking if the squared value exists in the set.
     - Track the length of each streak and update the maximum streak length.

4. **Check the Minimum Length**:
   - Since a square streak must be of length at least 2, return the maximum streak length if it's greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, return `-1`.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, where *n* is the length of `nums`, mainly due to sorting. The while loop to find streaks operates in ***O(log(max_val))*** for each element, where `max_val` is the largest element in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** due to the use of a set for quick lookup.

# Code:

```typescript
function longestSquareStreak(nums: number[]): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    let maxStreak = 0;

    for (const num of nums) {
        let current = num;
        let streakLength = 0;

        while (numSet.has(current)) {
            streakLength++;
            current = current * current;
        }

        maxStreak = Math.max(maxStreak, streakLength);
    }

    return maxStreak >= 2 ? maxStreak : -1;
};

```

### Explanation of Code and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

Input:
```plaintext
nums = [4, 3, 6, 16, 8, 2]
```

1. **Sort `nums`**:
   ```plaintext
   Sorted nums = [2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16]
   ```

2. **Initialize Tracking**:
   - `maxStreak` = 0.

3. **Find Streaks**:
   - Start with `num = 2`:
     - `streakLength = 0`.
     - Check `2` → valid, streak becomes `[2]`.
     - Next, `4` → valid, streak becomes `[2, 4]`.
     - Next, `16` → valid, streak becomes `[2, 4, 16]`.
     - `256` (next square) is not in the set.
     - `streakLength = 3`, update `maxStreak = 3`.
   - Repeat for other numbers, but no longer streak is found.

4. **Return Result**:
   - `maxStreak` is `3`, so we return `3`.

#### Example 2

Input:
```plaintext
nums = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
```

1. **Sort `nums`**:
   ```plaintext
   Sorted nums = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
   ```

2. **No Square Streak Found**:
   - Starting from each number results in a `streakLength` of 1 (or no valid streak).
   - `maxStreak = 1`, which is less than 2.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Since `maxStreak < 2`, we return `-1`.

### Summary

This solution leverages sorting and sets for efficient streak tracking, ensuring we achieve optimal performance while solving the problem correctly.
