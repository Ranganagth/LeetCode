[1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-difference-between-largest-and-smallest-value-in-three-moves/)

# Intuition

Given the constraint of performing at most three moves, we can think of these moves as opportunities to either reduce the largest values or increase the smallest values. By sorting the array, we can clearly see the smallest and largest values, and then we can strategically decide how to apply the moves to minimize the difference.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps us easily identify the smallest and largest values.
2. **Consider Different Scenarios**: We can try different combinations of changing the largest or smallest elements:
   - Change the three largest elements.
   - Change the two largest elements and one smallest element.
   - Change the one largest element and two smallest elements.
   - Change the three smallest elements.
3. **Calculate the Minimum Difference**: For each of these scenarios, calculate the difference between the new maximum and new minimum values.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array.
2. Consider the following four scenarios:
   - Change the last three elements.
   - Change the last two elements and the first element.
   - Change the last element and the first two elements.
   - Change the first three elements.
3. Compute the differences for each scenario and return the minimum difference.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n \log n)*** for sorting the array.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** for using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function minDifference(nums: number[]): number {
    if (nums.length <= 4) return 0;

    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = nums.length;

    const diff1 = nums[n - 1] - nums[3];
    const diff2 = nums[n - 2] - nums[2];
    const diff3 = nums[n - 3] - nums[1];
    const diff4 = nums[n - 4] - nums[0];

    return Math.min(diff1, diff2, diff3, diff4);
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Sort the Array**: We first sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest values.
2. **Compute Differences**: We compute the differences between the new maximum and new minimum values after considering the four scenarios of changing the elements.
3. **Return the Minimum Difference**: Finally, we return the minimum of these computed differences.
