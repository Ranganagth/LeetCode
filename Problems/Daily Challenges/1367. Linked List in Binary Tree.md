[1367. Linked List in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-in-binary-tree/)

# Intuition

The problem asks us to determine if the values of a linked list starting from the head correspond to a downward path in a binary tree. This means we need to traverse the binary tree and check if there exists a path that matches the linked list from root to any node in the tree.

Since the binary tree can have multiple paths, we need to check each node in the tree to see if the linked list can start from there. If we find such a node, we will continue to traverse downward, checking if the next nodes in the list match the subsequent nodes in the tree.

# Approach

1. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - We start by finding a node in the tree whose value matches the head of the linked list. From there, we recursively check if the next nodes in the linked list correspond to the downward path in the binary tree.
   
2. **Two Functions**:
   - **Main DFS** (`isSubPath`): This function will check each node of the tree as a potential starting point for the path.
   - **Helper DFS** (`dfs`): This function will recursively match the linked list with the tree nodes downward from the current tree node.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the linked list is empty, the answer is trivially `True`.
   - If the binary tree is empty but the linked list is non-empty, return `False`.
   - If the values of the nodes do not match at any point, the search should backtrack and continue looking at other parts of the tree.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n \times m)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree and `m` is the number of nodes in the linked list. For each node in the tree, we might need to compare up to `m` nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)*** for the recursion stack in the worst case where the depth of recursion is equal to the length of the linked list.

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function isSubPath(head: ListNode | null, root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!head) return true;
    if (!root) return false;
    
    function dfs(node: TreeNode | null, head: ListNode | null): boolean {
        if (!head) return true;
        if (!node) return false;

        if (node.val !== head.val) return false;

        return dfs(node.left, head.next) || dfs(node.right, head.next);
    }

    return dfs(root, head) || isSubPath(head, root.left) || isSubPath(head, root.right);
};

```

### Explanation

1. **`ListNode` and `TreeNode` Classes**:
   - `ListNode`: Represents a node in the linked list with a `val` and a `next` pointer.
   - `TreeNode`: Represents a node in the binary tree with a `val`, `left`, and `right` pointers.

2. **`isSubPath` Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If the head of the list is `null`, return `True` because an empty linked list is trivially a subpath. If the tree is empty (`root` is `null`), return `False` because there's no path to match a non-empty list.
   
   - **DFS Helper** (`dfs`): This function checks whether the current node in the tree can match the current node in the list and recursively tries to match the remaining list with the left and right subtrees of the current tree node.
   
   - **Main Logic**: Start by trying to match the linked list starting from the root. If this fails, recursively check the left and right subtrees of the tree for another possible starting point of the linked list.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
Input: `head = [4, 2, 8]`, `root = [1, 4, 4, null, 2, 2, null, 1, null, 6, 8]`

- The tree is traversed starting from the root node.
- At node with value `4`, the value matches the head of the list. The DFS continues checking for the next node.
- At node `2`, it matches the next value in the list.
- Finally, at node `8`, it matches the last value in the list. Thus, the function returns `True`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `head = [1, 4, 2, 6]`, `root = [1, 4, 4, null, 2, 2, null, 1, null, 6, 8]`

- The function matches values `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6` in a downward path in the tree, so the output is `True`.

#### Example 3:
Input: `head = [1, 4, 2, 6, 8]`, `root = [1, 4, 4, null, 2, 2, null, 1, null, 6, 8]`

- There is no path in the tree that contains all the elements of the linked list, so the output is `False`.
