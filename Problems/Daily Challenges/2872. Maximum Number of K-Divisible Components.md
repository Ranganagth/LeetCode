[2872. Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-k-divisible-components/)

# Intuition

The goal is to find the maximum number of connected components in a tree such that the sum of the node values in each component is divisible by *k*.

1. **Tree properties**: A tree with *n* nodes has  *n-1* edges. By removing an edge, we split the tree into two connected components.
2. **Divisibility condition**: To maximize the number of components, remove edges such that all resulting components satisfy the condition of having their total node values divisible by *k*.
3. **Post-order traversal**:
    - Perform a DFS from the root.
    - Compute the sum of values for the subtree rooted at each node.
    - Check if the subtree sum is divisible by *k*. If yes, consider removing the edge connecting this subtree to its parent.

# Approach

1. **Tree Representation**:
    - Represent the tree as an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
2. **Post-order DFS**:
    - Traverse the tree from any root (e.g., node 0).
    - Compute the sum of values for each subtree.
    - If the sum of a subtree is divisible by *k*, the edge connecting the subtree to its parent can be removed, forming a valid component.
3. **Count Valid Components**:
    - Start with a single component (the whole tree).
    - Increment the component count for every edge removed during traversal.

# Algorithm Steps

1. Parse the input to create an adjacency list for the tree.
2. Perform a post-order DFS traversal:
    - Compute the subtree sum at each node.
    - If the subtree sum is divisible by *k*, mark it as a valid component and remove the corresponding edge.
3. Return the total number of valid components.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***
    - Each node and edge is visited once during DFS.
	
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***
    - For the adjacency list and recursion stack.

# Code

```typescript
function maxKDivisibleComponents(
    n: number, 
    edges: number[][], 
    values: number[], 
    k: number
): number {
    // Step 1: Build the tree as an adjacency list
    const tree: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (const [a, b] of edges) {
        tree[a].push(b);
        tree[b].push(a);
    }

    let components = 0;

    // Step 2: DFS function to calculate subtree sums and split components
    const dfs = (node: number, parent: number): number => {
        let subtreeSum = values[node];

        for (const neighbor of tree[node]) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            subtreeSum += dfs(neighbor, node);
        }

        // If the subtree sum is divisible by k, it forms a valid component
        if (subtreeSum % k === 0) {
            components++;
            return 0; // This component is split, return 0 to the parent
        }

        return subtreeSum;
    };

    // Step 3: Start DFS from any node (e.g., 0)
    dfs(0, -1);

    // The entire tree starts as one component
    return components;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const n = 5;
const edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]];
const values = [1,8,1,4,4];
const k = 6;
console.log(maxValidComponents(n, edges, values, k)); // Output: 2
```

**Steps**:

1. Initial tree structure:
    
    ```
        0
        |
        2
       / \
      1   4
      |
      3
    ```
    
2. Subtree sums:
    - Node 3: *4* (not divisible by *6*).
    - Node 1: *8 + 4 = 12* (divisible by *6*). Remove edge *1 → 2*.
    - Node 4: *4* (not divisible by *6*).
    - Node 2: *1 + 4 + 1 = 6* (divisible by *6*). Remove edge *2 → 0*.
3. Valid components: *2*.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const n = 7;
const edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]];
const values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1];
const k = 3;
console.log(maxValidComponents(n, edges, values, k)); // Output: 3
```

**Steps**:

1. Initial tree structure:
    
    ```
          0
        /   \
       1     2
      / \   / \
     3   4 5   6
    ```
    
2. Subtree sums:
    - Node 3: *1* (not divisible by *3*).
    - Node 4: *5* (not divisible by *3*).
    - Node 1: *0 + 1 + 5 = 6* (divisible by *3*). Remove edge *1 → 0*.
    - Node 5: *2* (not divisible by *3*).
    - Node 6: *1* (not divisible by *3*).
    - Node 2: *6 + 2 + 1 = 9* (divisible by 33). Remove edge *2 → 0*.
3. Valid components: *3*.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Node**:
    - Input: *n = 1, values = [3], k = 3*.
    - Output: *1* (no edges to remove).
2. **All Values Divisible by k**:
    - Input: *n = 3, values = [3, 6, 9], k = 3*.
    - Output: *3* (remove all edges).

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum number of valid components.
