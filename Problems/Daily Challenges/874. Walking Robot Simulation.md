[874. Walking Robot Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/walking-robot-simulation/)

# Intuition and Approach

1. **Direction Management:**
   - The robot starts facing north and can turn left or right. We need to manage the direction using a sequence of vectors that represent the four possible directions (North, East, South, West).
   - We'll use an array `directions` to store these vectors:
     - North: (0, 1)
     - East: (1, 0)
     - South: (0, -1)
     - West: (-1, 0)
   - We’ll use an index to track the current direction in this array.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - For each move command (k units), we’ll update the robot's position based on the current direction.
   - We need to check if the new position collides with any obstacle. If it does, the robot remains at its current position and moves on to the next command.

3. **Obstacle Management:**
   - Store obstacles in a `Set` for O(1) average-time complexity lookups. This allows quick checks to see if the robot’s next position is blocked.

4. **Distance Calculation:**
   - After processing each command, compute the squared Euclidean distance from the origin and update the maximum distance found.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:**
  - *O(N)* where `N` is the number of commands, as each command is processed once. Checking for obstacles is *O(1)* due to the `Set` operations.
  - If there are M obstacles, preprocessing the obstacles into the `Set` takes ***O(M)*** time.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - ***O(M)*** for storing obstacles in the `Set`.
  - ***O(1)*** additional space for tracking position, direction, and maximum distance.

# Code:

```typescript
function robotSim(commands: number[], obstacles: number[][]): number {
    const directions: [number, number][] = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];
    let directionIndex = 0;
    let x = 0, y = 0;
    let maxDistSquared = 0;

    const obstacleSet = new Set(obstacles.map(([ox, oy]) => `${ox},${oy}`));

    for (const command of commands) {
        if (command === -2) {
            directionIndex = (directionIndex + 3) % 4;
        } else if (command === -1) {
            directionIndex = (directionIndex + 1) % 4;
        } else {
            const [dx, dy] = directions[directionIndex];
            for (let i = 0; i < command; i++) {
                const newX = x + dx;
                const newY = y + dy;
                if (!obstacleSet.has(`${newX},${newY}`)) {
                    x = newX;
                    y = newY;
                    maxDistSquared = Math.max(maxDistSquared, x * x + y * y);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxDistSquared;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Direction Handling:**
   - The robot's direction is managed using an index and a directions array. Turning left or right updates this index.

2. **Movement and Collision Detection:**
   - For each move command, check each step to see if it hits an obstacle. Update the robot’s position only if the move is valid.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - After processing each move, compute the squared distance from the origin and update the maximum if necessary.
