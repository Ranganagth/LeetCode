[1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-substrings-between-each-pair-of-parentheses/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of reversing the substrings inside parentheses, we need to handle nested structures effectively. The best data structure for this is a stack, as it allows us to process the innermost parentheses first and then move outward.

# Approach

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to store characters of the string.
2. **Iterate through the String**: For each character:
   - If it is a closing parenthesis `)`, pop characters from the stack until an opening parenthesis `(` is found, reverse the popped substring, and then push the reversed substring back onto the stack.
   - If it is any other character (including `(`), push it onto the stack.
3. **Form the Result**: After processing all characters, the stack will contain the final result without any parentheses.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)*** in the worst case due to repeated reversals inside nested parentheses.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing characters in the stack.

# Code

```typescript
function reverseParentheses(s: string): string {
    let stack: string[] = [];

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === ')') {
            let temp: string[] = [];
            while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] !== '(') {
                temp.push(stack.pop()!);
            }
            stack.pop();
            stack.push(...temp);
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }

    return stack.join('');
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Stack Initialization**: Create an empty stack to keep track of characters.
2. **Iterate through Each Character**:
   - **Closing Parenthesis `)`**: When encountering `)`, pop from the stack until `(` is found. Reverse the characters popped and push them back onto the stack.
   - **Other Characters**: Push them directly onto the stack.
3. **Join Stack**: After processing all characters, join the stack to form the final result.
