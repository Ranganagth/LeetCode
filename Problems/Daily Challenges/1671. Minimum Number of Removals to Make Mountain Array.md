[1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-removals-to-make-mountain-array/)

# Intuition

To make a given array a mountain array, it must have a single peak element, where:
- All elements before the peak are in strictly increasing order.
- All elements after the peak are in strictly decreasing order.

The task is to remove the minimum number of elements to achieve this mountain structure.

# Approach

1. **Identify Increasing and Decreasing Sequences**:
   - For each element in the array, calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) ending at that element.
   - Similarly, calculate the length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) starting from that element.

2. **Two Pass Dynamic Programming**:
   - **First Pass (LIS)**: For each element `nums[i]`, compute the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at `i` and store these values in an array `inc`.
   - **Second Pass (LDS)**: For each element `nums[i]`, compute the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting from `i` and store these values in an array `dec`.

3. **Calculate the Potential Peaks**:
   - For each element `i` in the array, check if it can be a valid peak. A valid peak should have both `inc[i] > 1` and `dec[i] > 1`, ensuring thereâ€™s an increasing part before it and a decreasing part after it.
   - Calculate the length of a mountain with `i` as the peak by adding `inc[i] + dec[i] - 1`. This gives the longest mountain subsequence containing `i`.

4. **Compute Minimum Removals**:
   - The minimum number of elements to remove is `nums.length - maxMountainLength`, where `maxMountainLength` is the maximum mountain length found.

5. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: ***O(n^2)*** for each pass of LIS and LDS due to nested loops over the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for storing the `inc` and `dec` arrays.

# Code:

```typescript
function minimumMountainRemovals(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    const inc: number[] = Array(n).fill(1);
    const dec: number[] = Array(n).fill(1);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                inc[i] = Math.max(inc[i], inc[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                dec[i] = Math.max(dec[i], dec[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    let maxMountainLength = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (inc[i] > 1 && dec[i] > 1) {
            maxMountainLength = Math.max(maxMountainLength, inc[i] + dec[i] - 1);
        }
    }

    return n - maxMountainLength;
};

```

### Explanation and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

Input:
```plaintext
nums = [1, 3, 1]
```

1. **LIS Calculation**:
   - `inc = [1, 2, 1]`

2. **LDS Calculation**:
   - `dec = [1, 2, 1]`

3. **Determine Peaks**:
   - The array already follows a mountain pattern (one peak at index 1). No removals are needed.

Output:
```plaintext
0
```

#### Example 2

Input:
```plaintext
nums = [2, 1, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3, 1]
```

1. **LIS Calculation**:
   - `inc = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1]`

2. **LDS Calculation**:
   - `dec = [1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]`

3. **Determine Peaks**:
   - Valid peaks with `inc[i] > 1` and `dec[i] > 1` are at indices 3 (`5`) and 4 (`6`).
   - The maximum mountain length achievable is `4` (`[1, 5, 6, 3, 1]`).

4. **Calculate Removals**:
   - To achieve this, we need `nums.length - maxMountainLength = 8 - 5 = 3` removals.

Output:
```plaintext
3
```

### Summary

This solution efficiently uses two-pass DP to compute the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences for each element, allowing us to identify potential peaks and the maximum mountain structure. By minimizing removals, we achieve the desired mountain array form in optimal time.
