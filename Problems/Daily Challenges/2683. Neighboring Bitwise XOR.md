[2683. Neighboring Bitwise XOR](https://leetcode.com/problems/neighboring-bitwise-xor/)

# Intuition

The problem asks us to determine whether a valid binary array `original` can produce the given `derived` array using XOR operations. The key observation here is that the XOR operation has specific properties:
1. *a ⊕ b = c* allows determining any one of a, b, c if the other two are known.
2. For circular arrays, the relationship between the first and last elements needs to be consistent to avoid contradictions.

The problem boils down to checking whether we can reconstruct the array `original` while maintaining consistency for a circular relationship:
- If the XOR chain calculated from `derived` ends with the same value as it started, it is consistent, and the array is valid.
- If not, it is impossible to construct `original`.

# Approach

1. **Understanding Circular Dependency**:
    - Start reconstructing `original` using the relationship *original[i + 1] = original[i] ⊕ derived[i]*.
    - For circular arrays, the first and last elements of `original` must satisfy *original[0] ⊕ derived[n − 1] = original[n − 1]*.
	
2. **Algorithm**:
    - Assume *original[0] = 0* and reconstruct the array.
    - Compute the XOR chain for all elements.
    - Check if the XOR chain aligns with the circular dependency. If it does, return `true`.
    - Repeat with *original[0] = 1* and check again.
    - If neither case works, return `false`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of `derived`, as we only iterate once to compute the XOR chain.

- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we don't use extra space for storing arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function doesValidArrayExist(derived: number[]): boolean {
    const n = derived.length;

    // Function to check validity given a starting value
    const check = (start: number): boolean => {
        let current = start;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            current = current ^ derived[i]; // Update current based on derived
        }
        return current === start; // Must return to the starting value
    };

    // Check for both possible starting values: 0 and 1
    return check(0) || check(1);
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const derived = [1, 1, 0];
console.log(doesValidArrayExist(derived)); // Output: true
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Assume *original[0] = 0*:
    - *original[1] = 0 ⊕ 1 = 1*,
    - *original[2] = 1 ⊕ 1 = 0*,
    - Circular check: *0 ⊕ 0 = 0* (valid).
	
2. *original[0] = 1* also works, producing another valid array.
    

**Output**: `true`.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const derived = [1, 1];
console.log(doesValidArrayExist(derived)); // Output: true
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Assume *original[0] = 0*:
    - original[1] = *0 ⊕ 1 = 1*,
    - Circular check: *1 ⊕ 1 = 0*.
2. *original[0] = 1* also works.
    

**Output**: `true`.

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
const derived = [1, 0];
console.log(doesValidArrayExist(derived)); // Output: false
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Assume *original[0] = 0*:
    - original[1] = *0 ⊕ 1 = 1*,
    - Circular check: *1 ⊕ 0 = 1 ≠ 0* (invalid).
2. Assume *original[0]=1*:
    - original[1] = *1 ⊕ 1 = 0*,
    - Circular check: *0 ⊕ 0 = 0 ≠ 1*.

**Output**: `false`.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Element**:
    - derived = [0], output: `true`.
    - derived = [1], output: `false`.
	
2. **Large Inputs**:
    - Handles **n ≤ 10^5** efficiently due to *O(n)* complexity.
