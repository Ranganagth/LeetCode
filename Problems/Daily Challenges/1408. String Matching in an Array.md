[1408. String Matching in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-matching-in-an-array/)

# Intuition

The problem asks us to find all strings in an array that are substrings of another string in the same array. A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters that appears in another string.

The key idea is to compare each string in the array against all other strings to check if it is a substring. Since all strings in the array are unique (as per the constraints), no two strings will match entirely unless one is a substring of another.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Start with an empty result array `result` to store valid substrings.
	
2. **Nested Iteration**:
    - Iterate over all strings in the array using two nested loops.
    - For each pair of strings, check if the current string is a substring of another string using the `includes` method.
	
3. **Skip Self-Comparison**:
    - Ensure a string is not compared to itself in the inner loop.
	
4. **Add to Result**:
    - If a string is a substring of another string, add it to the `result` array.
	
5. **Return Unique Results**:    
    - To prevent duplicate entries, use a `Set` to store unique substrings or ensure duplicates are not added during iteration.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - The outer loop runs **O(n)**, and the inner loop runs **O(n)** for each iteration.
    - The `includes` method checks for a substring in **O(m)**, where mm is the length of the longer string.
    - Overall complexity: ***O(n²⋅m)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - ***O(n)*** for storing the result array.

# Code

```typescript
function stringMatching(words: string[]): string[] {
    const result: Set<string> = new Set();

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < words.length; j++) {
            if (i !== j && words[j].includes(words[i])) {
                result.add(words[i]);
            }
        }
    }

    return Array.from(result);
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const words = ["mass", "as", "hero", "superhero"];
console.log(stringMatching(words)); // Output: ["as", "hero"]
```

**Execution**:

1. Compare "mass" with all other strings:
    - "mass" is not a substring of any other string.
2. Compare "as" with all other strings:
    - "as" is a substring of "mass".
3. Compare "hero" with all other strings:
    - "hero" is a substring of "superhero".
4. Compare "superhero" with all other strings:
    - "superhero" is not a substring of any other string.

**Output**:

```typescript
["as", "hero"]
```

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const words = ["leetcode", "et", "code"];
console.log(stringMatching(words)); // Output: ["et", "code"]
```

**Execution**:

1. Compare "leetcode" with all other strings:
    - "leetcode" is not a substring of any other string.
2. Compare "et" with all other strings:
    - "et" is a substring of "leetcode".
3. Compare "code" with all other strings:
    - "code" is a substring of "leetcode".

**Output**:

```typescript
["et", "code"]
```

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
const words = ["blue", "green", "bu"];
console.log(stringMatching(words)); // Output: []
```

**Execution**:

1. None of the strings is a substring of any other string.

**Output**:

```typescript
[]
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **All Strings Unique with No Substrings**:
    - Input: `["abc", "def", "ghi"]`.
    - Output: `[]`.
	
2. **All Strings Are Substrings of One Large String**:
    - Input: `["a", "b", "ab", "abc"]`.
    - Output: `["a", "b", "ab"]`.
	
3. **Single String**:
    - Input: `["abc"]`.
    - Output: `[]` (No other strings to compare).
