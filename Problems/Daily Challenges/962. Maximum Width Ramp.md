[962. Maximum Width Ramp](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-ramp/)

# Intuition

A **ramp** is a pair of indices *(i, j)* where *i < j* and *nums[i] ≤ nums[j]*. The **width** of the ramp is *j - i*. The goal is to find the maximum width of any ramp in the array.

The challenge arises from balancing the condition that *nums[i] ≤ nums[j]* while maximizing *j - i*. A brute-force solution would involve checking every possible pair, but this would result in a time complexity of *O(n²)*, which is too slow for large arrays.

# Approach

To optimize, we can approach the problem by trying to reduce the number of comparisons:

1. **Create a Monotonic Decreasing Stack**:
   - First, we traverse the array and maintain a stack of indices where the values at those indices are decreasing. This helps track potential starting points *i* for ramps since smaller values at earlier indices have a higher chance of finding larger values at later indices.

2. **Traverse the Array Backwards**:
   - Next, we traverse the array from the end to the beginning to find the maximum width ramp.
   - For each element *nums[j]*, check the top of the stack. If *nums[ stack[top] ] ≤ nums[j]*, then we can form a valid ramp with that index. Pop indices from the stack while the condition holds and compute the ramp width.

By doing this, we ensure that we only compute ramps that satisfy *nums[i] ≤ nums[j]* in an efficient way.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the array. We traverse the array twice, once to build the stack and once to compute the ramps.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the stack.

# Code

```typescript
function maxWidthRamp(nums: number[]): number {
    let stack: number[] = [];
    let maxWidth: number = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (stack.length === 0 || nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] > nums[i]) {
            stack.push(i);
        }
    }

    for (let j = nums.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && nums[stack[stack.length - 1]] <= nums[j]) {
            let i = stack.pop()!;
            maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, j - i);
        }
    }

    return maxWidth;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Build the Stack**:
   - We traverse the array once and build a **decreasing stack**. This stack stores indices where the values in the array form a non-increasing sequence.
   - The stack represents potential *i*-values for valid ramps, ensuring *nums[i] ≤ nums[j]* .

2. **Find the Maximum Width**:
   - We traverse the array backward (from the last element to the first). For each *j*, we pop elements from the stack where the condition *nums[i] ≤ nums[j]* holds, and compute the width *j - i*.
   - This ensures that we only compute valid ramps while maximizing the width.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
**Input**: `nums = [6,0,8,2,1,5]`

1. **Building the Stack**:
- For *i = 0*, stack is empty, so we push 0: `stack = [0]`.
- For *i = 1, nums[1] = 0 ≤ nums[0] = 6*, so we push 1: `stack = [0, 1]`.
- For *i = 2, nums[2] = 8 > nujms[1]*, do not push
- For *i = 3, nums[3] = 2 > nums[1]*, do not push.
- For *i = 4, nums[4] = 1 ≤ nums[3]*, push 4: `stack = [0, 1, 4]`.
- For *i = 5, nums[5] = 5 > nums[4]*, do not push.

2. **Finding the Maximum Width**:
   - Start from \(j = 5\):
     - *nums[4] = 1 ≤ nums[5] = 5, pop 4, width = 5− 4 = 1, `maxWidth = 1`.*
	- *nums[1] = 0 ≤ nums[5] = 5, pop 1, width = 5 − 1 = 4, `maxWidth = 4`.*
   - For *j = 4*, no more pops.
   - For *j = 3*, no more pops.
   - For *j = 2*, pop 0, width = *2 - 0 = 2*, `maxWidth = 4`.

**Output**: `4`.

#### Example 2
**Input**: `nums = [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]`

1. **Building the Stack**:
   - Push indices that create a decreasing stack: `stack = [0, 1, 3]`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Width**:
   - Start from \(j = 9\):
     - Pop 3, width = \(9 - 3 = 6\), `maxWidth = 6`.
     - Pop 1, width = \(9 - 1 = 8\), `maxWidth = 8`.

**Output**: `7`.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the maximum width of a ramp by leveraging a decreasing stack to store potential ramp starting points, allowing us to compute the result in linear time.
