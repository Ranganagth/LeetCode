[2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-beautiful-item-for-each-query/)

# Intuition
The goal is to find the maximum beauty for each price threshold given by `queries`. A brute-force approach would be too slow due to the high constraints, so we need a more efficient method. Sorting the items by price and processing queries in sorted order allows us to keep track of the maximum beauty up to each price, reducing the number of comparisons we need to make.

# Approach
1. **Sort Items by Price**: Sort `items` by price in ascending order. For the same price, we can ignore items with lower beauty values since they wonâ€™t impact the result.

2. **Sort Queries with Indices**: Sort the `queries` in ascending order, keeping track of their original indices to place the results in the correct positions later.

3. **Iterate Through Sorted Items and Queries**:
   - Keep a variable `max_beauty_so_far` that stores the maximum beauty encountered up to each price threshold.
   - For each query, process items with prices less than or equal to the query price and update `max_beauty_so_far` as you go.
   - Once no more items are less than or equal to the current query, store the `max_beauty_so_far` as the answer for that query.

4. **Store Results Using Original Query Order**: Since we stored the original indices of `queries`, place each computed result back into the correct position.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n + m log m)***, where *n* is the number of items and *n* is the number of queries.
  - Sorting `items` and `queries` each takes ***O(n log n)*** and ***O(m log m)***.
  - Processing items and queries in a single pass each takes ***O(n + m)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, for storing sorted `items`, sorted `queries`, and `answer`.

# Code

```typescript
function maximumBeauty(items: number[][], queries: number[]): number[] {
    // Step 1: Sort items by price
    items.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    // Step 2: Sort queries along with their original indices
    const sortedQueries = queries.map((value, index) => [value, index]).sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    // Step 3: Initialize variables
    const result = Array(queries.length).fill(0);
    let max_beauty_so_far = 0;
    let i = 0;

    // Step 4: Process each query
    for (const [queryPrice, originalIndex] of sortedQueries) {
        // Update max beauty for items with price <= queryPrice
        while (i < items.length && items[i][0] <= queryPrice) {
            max_beauty_so_far = Math.max(max_beauty_so_far, items[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // Record the result for this query at its original index
        result[originalIndex] = max_beauty_so_far;
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Sorting Items and Queries**: Sorting the `items` by price enables efficient processing for each query by limiting the number of items we check.
2. **Tracking Max Beauty for Queries**: As we iterate through `sortedQueries`, we keep a running maximum `max_beauty_so_far`. Each time we process an item, we update `max_beauty_so_far` if its beauty is higher.
3. **Using Original Indices for Results**: We store each answer at the original index of each query to ensure the final output matches the original order of `queries`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
**Input**:
```plaintext
items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]]
queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
```

**Steps**:
1. Sort `items` by price: `[[1,2], [2,4], [3,2], [3,5], [5,6]]`.
2. Sort `queries` with indices: `[(1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4), (6,5)]`.
3. Initialize `max_beauty_so_far = 0`.

   - **Query 1**: Only item `[1,2]` has `price <= 1`. `max_beauty_so_far = 2`.
   - **Query 2**: Items `[1,2]`, `[2,4]`. `max_beauty_so_far = 4`.
   - **Query 3**: Items `[1,2]`, `[2,4]`, `[3,2]`, `[3,5]`. `max_beauty_so_far = 5`.
   - **Query 4**: Same as Query 3. `max_beauty_so_far = 5`.
   - **Query 5** and **Query 6**: All items apply. `max_beauty_so_far = 6`.

**Output**: `[2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6]`

### Example 2
**Input**:
```plaintext
items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
queries = [1]
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
[4]
```

All items have price 1, so the maximum beauty for query 1 is 4.

### Example 3
**Input**:
```plaintext
items = [[10,1000]]
queries = [5]
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
[0]
```

No item has a price `<= 5`, so the output is 0 for this query.
