[1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-to-be-removed-to-make-array-sorted/)


# Intuition
To make `arr` non-decreasing, we need to remove the shortest contiguous subarray that would result in a non-decreasing sequence. We can break down the array into three parts:
1. **Left Segment**: The longest initial part of `arr` that is already non-decreasing.
2. **Right Segment**: The longest ending part of `arr` that is non-decreasing.
3. **Middle Segment**: A portion between the left and right segments that might need removal.

# Approach
1. **Identify the Left and Right Segments**:
   - Traverse from the beginning of `arr` to find the longest non-decreasing left segment.
   - Traverse from the end of `arr` to find the longest non-decreasing right segment.

2. **Evaluate Removal Options**:
   - If the left and right segments cover the entire array (i.e., `arr` is already non-decreasing), return `0`.
   - Otherwise, try to **merge** the left and right segments by removing the smallest middle segment:
     - For each possible boundary in the left segment, find the smallest valid starting index in the right segment that can form a non-decreasing sequence with the left boundary.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Length**:
   - Compare the length of possible middle segments that would allow merging the left and right segments and take the minimum length.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the length of `arr`, as we make single passes to identify the left and right segments, and a linear pass to calculate the minimal removal length.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because weâ€™re only using a constant amount of extra space for pointers and variables.

# Code

```typescript
function findLengthOfShortestSubarray(arr: number[]): number {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    // Step 1: Find the longest non-decreasing prefix (left segment)
    let left = 0;
    while (left < n - 1 && arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]) {
        left++;
    }
    
    // If the array is already non-decreasing
    if (left === n - 1) return 0;
    
    // Step 2: Find the longest non-decreasing suffix (right segment)
    let right = n - 1;
    while (right > 0 && arr[right - 1] <= arr[right]) {
        right--;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Initialize the minimum length of subarray to remove
    let minLengthToRemove = Math.min(n - left - 1, right); // remove either the prefix or the suffix completely

    // Step 4: Try merging left and right segments
    let i = 0, j = right;
    while (i <= left && j < n) {
        if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
            minLengthToRemove = Math.min(minLengthToRemove, j - i - 1);
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return minLengthToRemove;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]`
- **Left Segment**: `[1, 2, 3]` (from index 0 to 2)
- **Right Segment**: `[3, 5]` (from index 6 to 7)
- **Possible Merges**:
  - Remove `[10, 4, 2]` (indices 3 to 5), resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 3, 5]`.
- **Result**: `3`

#### Example 2
- **Input**: `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
- **Left Segment**: `[5]` (index 0 only)
- **Right Segment**: `[1]` (index 4 only)
- Since the array is strictly decreasing, the shortest subarray to remove is everything except one element.
- **Result**: `4`

#### Example 3
- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
- **Left Segment**: `[1, 2, 3]` (entire array)
- The array is already non-decreasing, so no need to remove any subarray.
- **Result**: `0`

### Explanation of Key Steps
1. By identifying the longest non-decreasing prefix and suffix, we isolate the possible smallest middle section to remove.
2. The merging step ensures that we explore all minimal options for removing elements between the left and right segments, allowing us to keep the solution optimal.
