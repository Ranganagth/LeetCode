[1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-a-string-into-the-max-number-of-unique-substrings/)

### Problem Understanding:

We are given a string `s` and need to split it into substrings such that:
1. The concatenation of the substrings forms the original string.
2. All substrings are unique.

The task is to find the **maximum number** of unique substrings we can split the string into. The length of the string is constrained to be small, which suggests we could use a **backtracking** approach.

# Intuition:

- **Backtracking**: We need to explore all possible ways to split the string into substrings and track the unique substrings.
- At each step, we decide whether to split at a particular position or extend the current substring, ensuring that the substrings formed so far are unique.
- The goal is to maximize the number of unique substrings, so we will attempt different splits recursively.

# Approach:

1. **Backtracking with Set**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the unique substrings seen so far.
   - Try to split the string from each position.
   - If the substring formed is not in the set, add it to the set and recursively continue splitting the remaining part of the string.
   - Once the entire string is processed, check if the current split produces more substrings than the best found so far.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the entire string has been processed, check if the number of unique substrings in the current split is greater than the maximum found so far.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - For each position `i` from the current start to the end of the string:
     - Form a substring from the current start to `i`.
     - If the substring is not already in the set of unique substrings, add it and recursively explore the remaining part of the string.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The recursive function will explore all possible ways to split the string, pruning invalid splits (where a substring is repeated).
   - Since the length of the string is constrained to a maximum of 16, this brute force approach is feasible.

# Complexity:

- The **time complexity** is exponential, but given the constraint ***1 ≤ s.length ≤ 16***, the maximum number of recursive calls will be small enough for this approach to work efficiently. Specifically, the complexity is ***O(2ⁿ)*** where *n* is the length of the string due to the different ways we can split the string.

# Code:

```typescript
function maxUniqueSplit(s: string): number {
    function backtrack(start: number, seen: Set<string>): number {
        if (start === s.length) return seen.size;
        
        let maxSplit = 0;
        
        for (let i = start + 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
            let substring = s.slice(start, i);
            
            if (!seen.has(substring)) {
                seen.add(substring);
                
                maxSplit = Math.max(maxSplit, backtrack(i, seen));
                
                seen.delete(substring);
            }
        }
        
        return maxSplit;
    }

    return backtrack(0, new Set());
};

```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `s = "ababccc"`

- We start from the beginning of the string and try all possible splits.
- Try the first split as `'a'`, then recursively try splitting the rest `'babccc'`.
- In the recursive call, we try splitting `'babccc'` into unique substrings. 
- After exploring all valid splits, one valid set of substrings is `['a', 'b', 'ab', 'c', 'cc']`.
- This gives us 5 unique substrings.

**Output**: `5`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `s = "aba"`

- Start by splitting `'a'` and then recursively split `'ba'`.
- Another valid split could be `'a', 'ba'`.
- This results in 2 unique substrings.

**Output**: `2`

#### Example 3:
**Input**: `s = "aa"`

- Since we cannot split the string without repeating the substring `'a'`, the best we can do is keep the entire string as one unique substring.

**Output**: `1`

### Explanation:

- The algorithm explores all possible ways to split the string into substrings.
- It uses backtracking to recursively build up valid sets of unique substrings.
- By exploring all splits, it ensures that the solution is optimal (i.e., finds the maximum number of unique substrings).
  
This approach efficiently solves the problem even for the maximum input size due to the manageable constraint on string length.
