[3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii/)

# Intuition

The goal is to minimize the number of key presses required to type a given string on a telephone keypad, which involves remapping the keys in an optimal way. Given that each key can be pressed multiple times depending on the position of the letter, the strategy involves:

1. Counting the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Assigning the most frequent characters to positions that require fewer presses.
3. Using a sorted frequency array to calculate the minimal key presses required.

# Approach

1. **Frequency Count**: Count the occurrences of each letter in the string.
2. **Sort Frequencies**: Sort the frequencies in descending order so that the most frequent letters come first.
3. **Calculate Minimum Pushes**:
   - Use the sorted frequencies to assign the letters to the keys in such a way that the most frequent letters are placed where fewer key presses are needed.
   - The key mapping is divided into groups of 8 (keys 2 to 9), where the first 8 letters incur a multiplier of 1, the next 8 a multiplier of 2, and so on.
   
# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + k log k)***, where *n* is the length of the string and *k* is the number of unique characters (at most 26).
  - Counting frequencies takes ***O(n)***.
  - Sorting the frequencies takes ***O(k log k)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)*** for the frequency count array.

# Code 

```typescript
function minimumPushes(word: string): number {
    const count: number[] = Array(26).fill(0);
  
    for (const char of word) {
        count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }
  
    count.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  
    let minimumPushes = 0;
  
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
        minimumPushes += (((i / 8) | 0) + 1) * count[i];
    }
  
    return minimumPushes;
};

```

## Example usage:
```typescript
console.log(minimumPushes("abcde")); // Output: 5
console.log(minimumPushes("xyzxyzxyzxyz")); // Output: 12
console.log(minimumPushes("aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii")); // Output: 24
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Count**: We initialize an array `count` of size 26 to store the frequency of each letter from 'a' to 'z'.
2. **Sort Frequencies**: We sort the frequency array in descending order to prioritize letters with higher frequencies.
3. **Calculate Pushes**: 
   - We iterate through the sorted frequency array.
   - For each character, we calculate the number of key presses required based on its position in the array.
   - Characters in the first group of 8 (i.e., `i < 8`) will have a multiplier of 1.
   - Characters in the second group of 8 (i.e., `8 <= i < 16`) will have a multiplier of 2, and so on.
