[552. Student Attendance Record II](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-ii/)


# Intuition
The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems by considering different states of the attendance record:
1. The total number of records of length `n` can be calculated by appending 'P', 'L', or 'A' to records of length `n-1`.
2. We need to ensure that:
   - There are fewer than 2 'A's in the entire record.
   - There are no three consecutive 'L's.

# Approach
1. **State Representation**:
   - Let `dp[i][j][k]` represent the number of valid attendance records of length `i` where:
     - `j` is the number of 'A's (0 or 1).
     - `k` is the number of consecutive 'L's (0, 1, or 2).

2. **Transition**:
   - We can extend the record of length `i-1` by appending 'P', 'L', or 'A':
     - Appending 'P' does not change the count of 'A's or 'L's.
     - Appending 'L' increments the count of consecutive 'L's.
     - Appending 'A' increments the count of 'A's and resets the consecutive 'L's.

3. **Initial State**:
   - Start with an empty record `dp[0][0][0] = 1` (one way to have an empty record).

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Sum up all `dp[n][j][k]` where `j` is 0 or 1 and `k` is 0, 1, or 2.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, since we are filling a DP table of size **3n**.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, since we need to maintain a DP table of size **3n**.

# Code

```typescript
function checkRecord(n: number): number {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array.from({ length: 2 }, () => Array(3).fill(0)));
    
    dp[0][0][0] = 1; 

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
            for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
                dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j][k]) % MOD;
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j - 1][k]) % MOD;
                }
                if (k > 0) {
                    dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i - 1][j][k - 1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < 2; j++) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 3; k++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
- **Initialization**: A 3D DP array `dp` is initialized where `dp[i][j][k]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences of length `i` with `j` 'A's and ending with `k` consecutive 'L's.
- **Transitions**: For each length `i`, the code iterates over all possible counts of 'A's (`j`) and consecutive 'L's (`k`), updating the DP table based on the possible characters that can be appended.
- **Final Calculation**: The result is computed by summing up all valid configurations for sequences of length `n`.
