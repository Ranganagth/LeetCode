[590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

# Intuition
In an n-ary tree, each node can have multiple children. The postorder traversal involves visiting all children of a node before visiting the node itself. This traversal is particularly useful for scenarios where the processing of a node depends on the processing of its children.

# Approach

#### Recursive Approach:
- **Postorder Traversal:** 
  - For each node, recursively perform a postorder traversal on all its children.
  - After visiting all children, visit the current node.

#### Iterative Approach:
- **Stack-Based Traversal:**
  - We use a stack to simulate the recursive call stack.
  - Push the root node onto the stack.
  - While the stack is not empty, pop a node and add it to the result list (the result list will store nodes in a reversed order of their actual postorder sequence).
  - Push all the children of the popped node onto the stack.
  - Finally, reverse the result list to get the correct postorder traversal.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(N)*** where N is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(N)*** in the worst case, due to the stack holding all nodes.

# Code

#### Iterative Solution
```typescript
class Node {
    val: number;
    children: Node[];

    constructor(val?: number, children?: Node[]) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.children = (children===undefined ? [] : children);
    }
}

function postorder(root: Node | null): number[] {
    if (root === null) return [];

    const stack: Node[] = [root];
    const result: number[] = [];

    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const node = stack.pop()!;
        result.push(node.val);

        for (const child of node.children) {
            stack.push(child);
        }
    }

    return result.reverse();
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case:** If the tree is empty (root is `null`), return an empty array.
2. **Stack Initialization:** Start with the root node in the stack.
3. **Traversal:** 
   - Pop the top node from the stack.
   - Add its value to the result list.
   - Push all its children onto the stack. This ensures that the last child will be processed first, maintaining the correct order for postorder traversal.
4. **Reversing the Result:** Since nodes are added to the result list in a reversed postorder sequence, reverse the list before returning it.
