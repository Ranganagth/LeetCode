[2200. Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-k-distant-indices-in-an-array/)

### Problem Summary

You're given an array `nums`, a `key`, and a number `k`. An index `i` is called a **k-distant index** if there's **at least one** index `j` such that:

* `|i - j| <= k` (within k distance)
* `nums[j] == key`

Return **all k-distant indices** in **increasing order**.

---

# Intuition

We're trying to find all indices `i` in the array that are within a distance `k` of any index `j` where `nums[j] == key`.

Instead of checking each index individually (which is inefficient), we:

1. First collect all indices `j` where `nums[j] == key`.
2. For each such `j`, mark all indices in the range `[j-k, j+k]` (bounded by array length) as valid.

This avoids unnecessary computation and ensures we cover only the required range.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize a `Set` to collect unique valid indices.
2. Iterate over `nums` and whenever `nums[i] == key`:

   * Add all indices in the range `[i - k, i + k]` into the set, if they are valid indices.
3. Convert the set to an array, sort it, and return.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: O(n \* k) in the worst case (if all values match the key and we insert k indices per match).

  * However, typically better due to bounded k.
* **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the set and result.

# Code

```ts
function findKDistantIndices(nums: number[], key: number, k: number): number[] {
    const n = nums.length;
    const result = new Set<number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === key) {
            const start = Math.max(0, i - k);
            const end = Math.min(n - 1, i + k);
            for (let j = start; j <= end; j++) {
                result.add(j);
            }
        }
    }

    return Array.from(result).sort((a, b) => a - b);
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

**Input**: `nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1`

* Key occurs at indices `2` and `5`
* For index `2`, include `[1,2,3]`
* For index `5`, include `[4,5,6]`
* Combined set: `{1,2,3,4,5,6}`
* Sorted result: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`

**Output**: `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
