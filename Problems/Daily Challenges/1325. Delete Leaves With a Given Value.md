[1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/)

# Intuition
The problem requires removing leaf nodes in a binary tree that have a specific value, and this process must continue until no more such leaf nodes exist. The intuition is to traverse the tree in a post-order manner (left, right, root) so that we handle the leaf nodes first before their parent nodes. By the time we visit a node, we will have already processed its children, making it straightforward to decide if the node itself has become a leaf node that needs removal.

# Approach
1. **Post-order Traversal**: This ensures that children nodes are processed before their parents. This is crucial because a node might become a leaf node only after its children are removed.
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - **Base Case**: If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
   - **Recursive Step**: Process the left and right subtrees by calling the function recursively.
   - **Check and Remove Leaf**: After processing the children, check if the current node is a leaf and if its value matches the target. If both conditions are met, return `null` to indicate the node should be removed.
3. **Return the Updated Tree**: After processing the entire tree, return the possibly updated root.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), the space complexity can be `O(N)`.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;

    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
        this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
    }
}

function removeLeafNodes(root: TreeNode | null, target: number): TreeNode | null {
    if (root === null) {
        return null;
    }

    root.left = removeLeafNodes(root.left, target);
    root.right = removeLeafNodes(root.right, target);

    if (root.left === null && root.right === null && root.val === target) {
        return null;
    }

    return root;
};

```

# Example
``` Typescript
let root = new TreeNode(1,
    new TreeNode(2,
        new TreeNode(2),
        null
    ),
    new TreeNode(3,
        new TreeNode(2),
        new TreeNode(4)
    )
);

const target = 2;
const updatedRoot = removeLeafNodes(root, target);
console.log(updatedRoot);
```

# Explanation
- **Initial Tree**:
  ```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   /   / \
  2   2   4
  ```
- **Target Value**: 2
- **Process**:
  1. Process the leaf nodes:
     - Remove `2` from the left subtree (`2` becomes `null`).
     - Remove `2` from the right subtree of the right child (`2` becomes `null`).
  2. Process the parents:
     - The node with value `2` (left child of the root) now has no children, so it is removed.
     - The node with value `3` (right child of the root) now has only one child (`4`).

- **Resulting Tree**:
  ```
      1
       \
        3
         \
          4
  ```

> The function recursively processes each node, removing any leaf nodes that match the target, and continues this process until the entire tree is processed. The post-order traversal ensures that by the time we check a node, its children have already been processed.
