[1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-lexicographically-largest-valid-sequence/)

# Intuition

The problem requires constructing a sequence such that:

1. Each integer *i* between 2 and *n* appears twice, and the two occurrences are spaced exactly *i* indices apart.
2. The sequence must be lexicographically largest, meaning we prioritize placing larger numbers first whenever possible.

This is a constraint-satisfaction problem where backtracking works effectively. By attempting to place the largest number at every available valid position, we can ensure the sequence is lexicographically largest.

# Approach

1. **Recursive Backtracking**:
    - Start from the largest number *n* and try to place it in the sequence.
    - For each number *i*, ensure:
        - Two slots exist for *i* at indices *x* and *x + i*.
    - Use a backtracking approach to explore all valid placements for *i* before proceeding to smaller numbers.
	
2. **Placement Validation**:
    - Use an array of size *2n - 1* initialized with zeros to represent the sequence.
    - Check if positions *x* and *x + i* are empty (zero) before placing *i*.
	
3. **Base Case**:
    - If all numbers from *n* to 1 are placed correctly, the sequence is complete.
	
4. **Lexicographical Priority**:
    - Always attempt to place the largest remaining number first to maintain the lexicographically largest order.
	
5. **Complexity**:
    - The maximum size of the sequence is *2n - 1*, and the recursive backtracking explores placements for each number, making the solution feasible within constraints.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - The recursive backtracking explores all valid placements for *n* numbers. In the worst case, it checks placements for each position in the sequence, making the complexity approximately ***O((2n âˆ’ 1)!)***. However, pruning significantly reduces the number of explored states.
	
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The sequence array and recursion stack depth contribute ***O(n)***.

# Code

```typescript
function constructDistancedSequence(n: number): number[] {
    const sequence = new Array(2 * n - 1).fill(0); // Initialize sequence with zeros
    const used = new Array(n + 1).fill(false); // Track used numbers

    const backtrack = (index: number): boolean => {
        if (index === sequence.length) {
            return true; // Sequence is complete
        }

        // Skip if the current position is already filled
        if (sequence[index] !== 0) {
            return backtrack(index + 1);
        }

        // Try placing numbers from n to 1
        for (let num = n; num >= 1; num--) {
            if (!used[num]) {
                if (num === 1) {
                    // Place 1 (only occupies one position)
                    sequence[index] = 1;
                    used[1] = true;

                    if (backtrack(index + 1)) return true;

                    // Backtrack
                    sequence[index] = 0;
                    used[1] = false;
                } else {
                    // Check if num can be placed
                    const nextIndex = index + num;
                    if (
                        nextIndex < sequence.length &&
                        sequence[index] === 0 &&
                        sequence[nextIndex] === 0
                    ) {
                        // Place num
                        sequence[index] = num;
                        sequence[nextIndex] = num;
                        used[num] = true;

                        if (backtrack(index + 1)) return true;

                        // Backtrack
                        sequence[index] = 0;
                        sequence[nextIndex] = 0;
                        used[num] = false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false; // No valid placements
    };

    backtrack(0); // Start backtracking from the first index
    return sequence;
};

## **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 3;
```

**Execution**:

1. Initialize the sequence as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
2. Start placing numbers from 3 to 1:
    - Place 3 at indices 0 and 3: `[3, 0, 0, 3, 0]`.
    - Place 2 at indices 2 and 4: `[3, 0, 2, 3, 2]`.
    - Place 1 at index 1: `[3, 1, 2, 3, 2]`.

**Output**:

```typescript
constructDistancedSequence(3); // [3, 1, 2, 3, 2]
```

### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 5;
```

**Execution**:

1. Initialize the sequence as `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
2. Start placing numbers from 5 to 1:
    - Place 5 at indices 0 and 5: `[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]`.
    - Place 4 at indices 3 and 7: `[5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0]`.
    - Place 3 at indices 1 and 4: `[5, 3, 0, 4, 3, 5, 0, 4, 0]`.
    - Place 2 at indices 6 and 8: `[5, 3, 0, 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 2]`.
    - Place 1 at index 2: `[5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 2]`.

**Output**:

```typescript
constructDistancedSequence(5); // [5, 3, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 4, 2]
```

## **Edge Cases**

1. **Smallest n = 1**:
    - Output: `[1]` (only one element).
2. **Larger n**:
    - The solution must handle larger sequences efficiently due to backtracking.
