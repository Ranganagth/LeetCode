[725. Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/)

# Intuition

We need to split the linked list into `k` parts such that:
- The length of each part is as equal as possible.
- The earlier parts have a size greater than or equal to the later parts.
- If there are not enough nodes to fill `k` parts, some parts should be `null`.

The challenge here is to figure out how to split the linked list into parts with this balance. We first calculate the total number of nodes in the list and then determine how many nodes should go into each part.

# Approach

1. **Calculate the Length**: Traverse the list once to calculate the total length of the list (`n`).

2. **Determine the Sizes of Each Part**:
   - Each part will have a base size of `n // k` (i.e., `part_size`).
   - The first `n % k` parts will have one additional node to distribute the remainder evenly.

3. **Traverse and Split**:
   - Using the size information, traverse the list again, splitting it into parts by adjusting the `next` pointers at the right points.
   - If there are fewer nodes than `k`, some parts will be `null`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - We traverse the linked list twice: once to calculate the length and once to split the list.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k)*** for the result array of size `k`.

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function splitListToParts(head: ListNode | null, k: number): Array<ListNode | null> {
    const result: Array<ListNode | null> = new Array(k).fill(null);
    let length = 0;
    let current = head;
    
    while (current) {
        length++;
        current = current.next;
    }

    const partSize = Math.floor(length / k);
    let extraNodes = length % k;
    
    current = head;
    let prev: ListNode | null = null;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        result[i] = current;
        let partLength = partSize + (extraNodes > 0 ? 1 : 0);
        extraNodes--;

        for (let j = 0; j < partLength; j++) {
            prev = current;
            if (current) {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        
        if (prev) {
            prev.next = null;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **ListNode Class**: Represents each node in the linked list, with a `val` for the value and `next` pointer to the next node.

2. **`splitListToParts` Function**:
   - **Step 1**: First, we traverse the linked list to compute its total length (`n`).
   - **Step 2**: We calculate the size of each part:
     - The base size of each part is `n // k`, and the first `n % k` parts get an extra node.
   - **Step 3**: We then split the linked list:
     - We traverse the list again, collecting nodes for each part. After collecting the required nodes for a part, we break the link to the next part by setting `prev.next = null`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
Input: `head = [1,2,3]`, `k = 5`

1. **Step 1**: Length of the list = 3.
2. **Step 2**: The base size of each part is `3 // 5 = 0`. There are `3 % 5 = 3` extra nodes to distribute.
3. **Step 3**:
   - Part 1: Take 1 node (extra node), part is `[1]`.
   - Part 2: Take 1 node (extra node), part is `[2]`.
   - Part 3: Take 1 node (extra node), part is `[3]`.
   - Part 4: No nodes, part is `null`.
   - Part 5: No nodes, part is `null`.

Output: `[[1], [2], [3], [], []]`

#### Example 2:
Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`, `k = 3`

1. **Step 1**: Length of the list = 10.
2. **Step 2**: The base size of each part is `10 // 3 = 3`. There is `10 % 3 = 1` extra node to distribute.
3. **Step 3**:
   - Part 1: Take 4 nodes (base size 3 + 1 extra node), part is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - Part 2: Take 3 nodes (base size 3), part is `[5, 6, 7]`.
   - Part 3: Take 3 nodes (base size 3), part is `[8, 9, 10]`.

Output: `[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]`
