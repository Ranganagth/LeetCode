[2684. Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-moves-in-a-grid/)

### Problem Intuition

In this problem, we’re given a matrix, and we can start in any cell in the first column. From each cell, we can only move to specific neighboring cells in the next column if the value of that cell is strictly greater than the current cell. The goal is to find the maximum number of moves (steps) we can make while following this rule.

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming with DFS**:
   - This problem can be solved using DFS with memoization to store intermediate results for each cell, thereby reducing redundant calculations.
   - We can define `dp[row][col]` as the maximum number of moves starting from `grid[row][col]`.
   
2. **Transition Options**:
   - From any cell `(row, col)`, we have three possible moves to the next column:
     - `(row - 1, col + 1)` (up-right),
     - `(row, col + 1)` (right),
     - `(row + 1, col + 1)` (down-right).
   - For each transition, check if the next cell has a strictly higher value than the current cell.
   
3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - If we’re at cell `(row, col)`, calculate the maximum moves from each valid neighboring cell and choose the maximum among them:
     \[
     dp[row][col] = 1 + \max(dp[nextRow][nextCol]) \text{ for valid moves}
     \]
   - If there are no valid moves from a cell, `dp[row][col] = 0`.

4. **Base Case and Result**:
   - Start by finding the maximum moves possible from each cell in the first column and update `maxMoves` accordingly.

5. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), as each cell is visited once.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) for storing intermediate results in `dp`.

### Code (TypeScript)

Here’s the TypeScript code:

```typescript
function maxMoves(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const dp: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(-1));

    function dfs(row: number, col: number): number {
        if (dp[row][col] !== -1) return dp[row][col];

        let maxMovesFromHere = 0;
        const directions = [[-1, 1], [0, 1], [1, 1]];

        for (const [dRow, dCol] of directions) {
            const newRow = row + dRow;
            const newCol = col + dCol;

            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol < n && grid[newRow][newCol] > grid[row][col]) {
                maxMovesFromHere = Math.max(maxMovesFromHere, 1 + dfs(newRow, newCol));
            }
        }

        dp[row][col] = maxMovesFromHere;
        return dp[row][col];
    }

    let maxMoves = 0;
    for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
        maxMoves = Math.max(maxMoves, dfs(row, 0));
    }

    return maxMoves;
};

```

### Explanation and Walkthrough

#### Example 1

Input:
```plaintext
grid = [
    [2, 4, 3, 5],
    [5, 4, 9, 3],
    [3, 4, 2, 11],
    [10, 9, 13, 15]
]
```

1. **Starting Point**:
   - Starting from each cell in the first column (`(0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0)`), we apply DFS to find the longest path following the movement rules.

2. **DFS Calculations**:
   - **From (0,0)**:
     - Move to `(0,1)` since `grid[0][1] = 4` > `grid[0][0] = 2`.
     - From `(0,1)`, move to `(1,2)` since `grid[1][2] = 9` > `grid[0][1] = 4`.
     - From `(1,2)`, move to `(2,3)` since `grid[2][3] = 11` > `grid[1][2] = 9`.
     - Total moves = 3.

3. **Result**:
   - The maximum moves from any start cell in the first column is `3`, so `maxMoves = 3`.

#### Example 2

Input:
```plaintext
grid = [
    [3, 2, 4],
    [2, 1, 9],
    [1, 1, 7]
]
```

1. **Starting Point**:
   - Any cell in the first column will yield 0 moves, as no valid moves can be made according to the rule.

2. **Result**:
   - `maxMoves = 0`.

### Summary

This solution uses DFS with memoization to handle multiple paths in an efficient way, avoiding recalculations for each cell. This approach ensures optimal performance with a clear recurrence relation and straightforward transition rules, making it well-suited for large matrices.
