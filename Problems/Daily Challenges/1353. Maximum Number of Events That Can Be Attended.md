[1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/)

### Problem Summary

You are given an array of events, each with a start and end day. You can attend only **one event per day**, and **an event can be attended on any day within its range**.
Return the **maximum number of events** you can attend.

---

# Intuition

To maximize the number of events attended, we must **greedily choose the earliest possible day to attend an event**, prioritizing **events that end sooner**, as they offer the smallest time window.

If we delay attending short-window events, we might miss the chance entirely.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort events by start day**.
2. Use a **min-heap (priority queue)** to track the **end days** of events available on the current day.
3. For each day from `minStart` to `maxEnd`:
   * **Add all events starting on that day to the heap**.
   * **Remove events from the heap that have already expired** (i.e., end day < current day).
   * If heap is not empty:
     * **Attend the event with the earliest end day** (pop from heap).
     * **Increment the count**.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(N log N), where N is the number of events:

  * Sorting events: O(N log N)
  * Processing each event: O(log N) insertion/removal from heap
* **Space:** O(N) for the heap and sorted event list

---

# Code

```ts
function maxEvents(events: number[][]): number {
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // Sort by start day

    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue<number>(); // heap stores end days
    let day = 0;
    let i = 0;
    let attended = 0;
    const n = events.length;

    // Find the earliest and latest possible days
    const maxDay = Math.max(...events.map(e => e[1]));

    for (day = 1; day <= maxDay; day++) {
        // Add all events starting today to the heap
        while (i < n && events[i][0] === day) {
            minHeap.enqueue(events[i][1]);
            i++;
        }

        // Remove expired events (end day < current day)
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.front() < day) {
            minHeap.dequeue();
        }

        // Attend the event that ends the earliest
        if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            minHeap.dequeue();
            attended++;
        }
    }

    return attended;
};

```

You can use the `MinPriorityQueue` from the `@datastructures-js/priority-queue` package, or implement your own.

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`

Sorted Events: `[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]`

| Day | Events starting today | Heap (end days) | Action        | Count |
| --- | --------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| 1   | \[1,2]                | \[2]            | Attend \[1,2] | 1     |
| 2   | \[2,3]                | \[3]            | Attend \[2,3] | 2     |
| 3   | \[3,4]                | \[4]            | Attend \[3,4] | 3     |
| 4   | -                     | -               | Done          |       |

Result: `3`

### **Summary**

* Use a **greedy approach with a min-heap** to always attend the soonest-ending event.
* This guarantees you leave room for longer events to be scheduled later.
* Efficient and suitable for large inputs.
