[342. Power of Four](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-four/)

# Intuition
A number is a **power of four** if:
1. **It’s positive** — because powers of four are always greater than zero.
2. **It’s a power of two** — in binary form, a power of two has exactly one `1` bit set.  
   Example:  
   - 4 → `100`  
   - 8 → `1000`  
3. **That `1` bit is in an odd position (0-indexed)** — because powers of four have the `1` bit only in positions: 0, 2, 4, 6, ...  
   Example:  
   - 4¹ = 4 → bit position 2  
   - 4² = 16 → bit position 4  

If we know a number is a **power of two** and the position of its single `1` bit is even, it must be a **power of four**.

# Approach (No Loops / No Recursion)

### Mathematical property method
- Check if `n > 0`
- Check if `n` is a power of two using:  
  ```ts
  (n & (n - 1)) === 0
  ```
  This works because powers of two have exactly one `1` bit, so subtracting 1 flips all bits after it.
- Check if that single `1` bit is in the right position for a power of four:  
  This can be done using a bitmask `0x55555555` (binary: `01010101010101010101010101010101`) — it has 1’s in all **even positions**.  
  ```ts
  (n & 0x55555555) !== 0
  ```

### Final condition
```ts
n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0 && (n & 0x55555555) !== 0
```

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: **O(1)** — constant number of operations
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** — no extra memory used

---

# Code
```typescript
function isPowerOfFour(n: number): boolean {
    // Check positive, power of two, and bit in correct position
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) === 0 && (n & 0x55555555) !== 0;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### Example 1:  
```
n = 16  
Binary: 10000  
Step 1: n > 0 → true  
Step 2: n & (n - 1) → 10000 & 01111 = 00000 → true (power of two)  
Step 3: n & 0x55555555 → 10000 & 01010101010101010101010101010101 = 10000 → not zero → true  

Output: true
```

### Example 2:  
```
n = 5  
Binary: 101  
Step 1: n > 0 → true  
Step 2: n & (n - 1) → 101 & 100 = 100 → not zero → false  

Output: false
```

### Example 3:  
```
n = 1  
Binary: 1  
Step 1: n > 0 → true  
Step 2: n & (n - 1) → 1 & 0 = 0 → true (power of two)  
Step 3: n & 0x55555555 → 1 & 01010101010101010101010101010101 = 1 → not zero → true  

Output: true
```
