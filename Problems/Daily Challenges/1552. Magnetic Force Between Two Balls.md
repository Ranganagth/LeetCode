[1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/magnetic-force-between-two-balls/)

# Intuition
The key idea is to use binary search to find the maximum possible minimum distance between any two balls. We start by sorting the basket positions to facilitate the search for the maximum minimum distance. The solution involves checking for the feasibility of placing the balls with a given minimum distance using a greedy approach.

# Approach
1. **Sort the Positions**: Sort the array `position` to make it easier to place balls with a minimum distance.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: 
   - Initialize `low` to 1 (the smallest possible minimum distance).
   - Initialize `high` to `position[n-1] - position[0]` (the largest possible minimum distance, which is the difference between the furthest apart baskets).
3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - For each middle point (`mid`) in the binary search range:
     - Use a greedy approach to check if it's possible to place all `m` balls such that the minimum distance between any two balls is at least `mid`.
     - If it is possible, it means we can potentially increase the minimum distance, so we adjust the binary search range accordingly.
4. **Greedy Placement**:
   - Start by placing the first ball in the first basket.
   - Attempt to place each subsequent ball in the next possible basket that maintains at least the current `mid` distance from the last placed ball.
   - If all `m` balls can be placed this way, the `mid` distance is feasible.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log(max_distance))***, where `n` is the number of baskets, and `max_distance` is the difference between the maximum and minimum basket positions.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function maxDistance(position: number[], m: number): number {
    position.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    const isFeasible = (minDist: number): boolean => {
        let count = 1;
        let lastPos = position[0];
        for (let i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - lastPos >= minDist) {
                count++;
                lastPos = position[i];
                if (count >= m) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return count >= m;
    }
    
    let low = 1;
    let high = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];
    
    while (low <= high) {
        let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (isFeasible(mid)) {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return high;
};

```

### Explanation of the Examples
1. **Example 1**:
   - Positions: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]`
   - Balls: `3`
   - The optimal placement is at positions `[1, 4, 7]` with a minimum distance of `3`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Positions: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1000000000]`
   - Balls: `2`
   - The optimal placement is at positions `[1, 1000000000]` with a minimum distance of `999999999`.
