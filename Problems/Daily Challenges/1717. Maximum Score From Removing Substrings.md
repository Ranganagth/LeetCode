[1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/)

# Intuition

To maximize the points from removing substrings "ab" and "ba", we need to consider the order in which we remove these substrings. Depending on the points `x` and `y`, the optimal order may change. 

- If `x > y`, we should prioritize removing "ab" first to gain the higher points.
- If `y > x`, we should prioritize removing "ba" first to gain the higher points.

By removing the higher point substrings first, we maximize the total score.

# Approach

1. **Determine the Removal Priority**: Based on the values of `x` and `y`, decide which substring removal should be prioritized.
2. **Stack-Based Removal**: Use a stack to simulate the removal process. This helps efficiently manage the removal of substrings.
    - Push characters onto the stack.
    - When encountering a character that could complete a target substring for removal (either "ab" or "ba"), pop the relevant characters and add the corresponding points to the score.
3. **Two Passes**:
    - First pass: Remove the higher-priority substring ("ab" or "ba").
    - Second pass: Remove the remaining lower-priority substring from the processed string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the stack.

# Code
```typescript
function maximumGain(s: string, x: number, y: number): number {
    let maxPoints = 0;

    const removePattern = (s: string, first: string, second: string, points: number): [string, number] => {
        let stack: string[] = [];
        let score = 0;

        for (let char of s) {
            if (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] === first && char === second) {
                stack.pop();
                score += points;
            } else {
                stack.push(char);
            }
        }
        return [stack.join(''), score];
    };

    if (x >= y) {
        let [intermediate, points] = removePattern(s, 'a', 'b', x);
        maxPoints += points;
        [, points] = removePattern(intermediate, 'b', 'a', y);
        maxPoints += points;
    } else {
        let [intermediate, points] = removePattern(s, 'b', 'a', y);
        maxPoints += points;
        [, points] = removePattern(intermediate, 'a', 'b', x);
        maxPoints += points;
    }

    return maxPoints;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **removePattern Function**:
    - This helper function uses a stack to remove occurrences of a specified pattern (either "ab" or "ba") from the string and calculates the points gained from these removals.
    - It iterates through the characters of the string, managing the stack to track and remove the desired patterns.

2. **Main Function**:
    - Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it determines which pattern to prioritize.
    - It makes two passes over the string using the `removePattern` function to remove the higher-priority pattern first and then the lower-priority pattern from the resulting string.
