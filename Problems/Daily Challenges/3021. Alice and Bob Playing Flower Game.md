[3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/alice-and-bob-playing-flower-game/)

# Intuition  
The game is similar to a **Nim game with 2 heaps** (the two lanes of flowers).  
- On each turn, a player can remove **exactly 1 flower** from either heap.  
- The winner is the one who makes the last move.  

This is equivalent to a **take-away game** where the total number of moves is fixed = `x + y`.  

- Since Alice moves first, she wins if the total number of flowers `(x + y)` is **odd**.  
- If `(x + y)` is even, Bob wins (because Alice and Bob alternate, so Bob gets the last move).  

So the problem reduces to:  
Count pairs `(x, y)` with `1 ≤ x ≤ n`, `1 ≤ y ≤ m` such that `x + y` is odd.  

---

# Approach  
1. Split the counts of numbers into **even** and **odd**:  
   - In range `[1..n]`:  
     - `oddX = ceil(n / 2)`  
     - `evenX = floor(n / 2)`  
   - In range `[1..m]`:  
     - `oddY = ceil(m / 2)`  
     - `evenY = floor(m / 2)`  

2. For `x + y` to be odd:  
   - Case 1: `x` odd + `y` even  
   - Case 2: `x` even + `y` odd  

3. Total valid pairs = `oddX * evenY + evenX * oddY`.  

---

# Complexity  
- **Time complexity:** O(1) (just arithmetic).  
- **Space complexity:** O(1).  

---

# Code

```typescript
function flowerGame(n: number, m: number): number {
    const oddX = Math.ceil(n / 2);
    const evenX = Math.floor(n / 2);
    const oddY = Math.ceil(m / 2);
    const evenY = Math.floor(m / 2);

    return oddX * evenY + evenX * oddY;
}
```

## Example walkthrough

### Example 1  
Input: `n = 3, m = 2`  

- For x in [1,3] → oddX = 2 (1,3), evenX = 1 (2).  
- For y in [1,2] → oddY = 1 (1), evenY = 1 (2).  
- Valid pairs = `oddX*evenY + evenX*oddY = 2*1 + 1*1 = 3`.  

Pairs are: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).  
Output = **3**.  

---

### Example 2  
Input: `n = 1, m = 1`  

- oddX = 1, evenX = 0.  
- oddY = 1, evenY = 0.  
- Valid pairs = `1*0 + 0*1 = 0`.  

Output = **0**.
