[2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://leetcode.com/problems/put-marbles-in-bags/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to divide marbles (weights) into `k` bags while **maximizing and minimizing** the sum of costs. The cost of each bag is defined as the sum of the first and last marble in that bag.

### **Key Observations**

1. **Fixed Order**: Since we must place marbles in contiguous groups, the order of the array remains unchanged.
2. **Choosing Split Points**: The **decision boils down to selecting `k-1` split points** in the array.
3. **Cost Calculation**:
    - If we want to **maximize the score**, we should maximize the sum of selected split points.    
    - If we want to **minimize the score**, we should minimize the sum of selected split points.
    

### **Transforming the Problem**

Instead of splitting directly, consider **pair-wise differences**:

- The **cost of a bag** is determined by the sum of the first and last element in that segment.
- The total score difference is affected by how we **break the array into contiguous parts**.

### **How to Calculate Differences**

Define `pairDiffs[i] = weights[i] + weights[i+1]` for all `i`. These differences help us determine where to split.

# Approach

1. **Compute Differences**:
    - Calculate all **pair-wise differences** between adjacent marbles.    
    - Store them in an array `pairDiffs`.
    
2. **Sort the Pair Differences**:
    - To **maximize the score**, we should pick the **largest `k-1` differences**.    
    - To **minimize the score**, we should pick the **smallest `k-1` differences**.
    
3. **Compute the Difference**:
    
    - Compute `maxScore` by summing the largest `k-1` differences.
    - Compute `minScore` by summing the smallest `k-1` differences.
    - Return `maxScore - minScore`.

# Code

```typescript
function putMarbles(weights: number[], k: number): number {
    if (k === 1) return 0; // Only one bag, no score difference

    const pairDiffs: number[] = [];

    // Step 1: Compute pair-wise differences
    for (let i = 0; i < weights.length - 1; i++) {
        pairDiffs.push(weights[i] + weights[i + 1]);
    }

    // Step 2: Sort the pair differences
    pairDiffs.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Step 3: Compute max and min scores using k-1 largest and smallest sums
    let minScore = 0, maxScore = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
        minScore += pairDiffs[i]; // Smallest k-1 values
        maxScore += pairDiffs[pairDiffs.length - 1 - i]; // Largest k-1 values
    }

    // Step 4: Return the difference
    return maxScore - minScore;
};

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input**

```typescript
console.log(putMarbles([1,3,5,1], 2));
```

#### **Processing**

1. **Pair Differences Calculation**:    
    ```
    pairDiffs = [1+3, 3+5, 5+1] = [4, 8, 6]
    ```

2. **Sorting**:    
    ```
    Sorted pairDiffs = [4, 6, 8]
    ```

3. **Min Score Calculation** (`k-1 = 1` smallest sum):    
    ```
    minScore = 4
    ```

4. **Max Score Calculation** (`k-1 = 1` largest sum):    
    ```
    maxScore = 8
    ```

5. **Output**:
    ```
    maxScore - minScore = 8 - 4 = 4
    ```

#### **Output**

```typescript
4
```

### **Example 2**

#### **Input**

```typescript
console.log(putMarbles([1, 3], 2));
```

#### **Processing**

1. **Pair Differences Calculation**:
    
    ```
    pairDiffs = [1+3] = [4]
    ```
    
2. **Sorting**:
    
    ```
    Sorted pairDiffs = [4]
    ```
    
3. **Min Score Calculation** (`k-1 = 1` smallest sum):
    
    ```
    minScore = 4
    ```
    
4. **Max Score Calculation** (`k-1 = 1` largest sum):
    
    ```
    maxScore = 4
    ```
    
5. **Output**:
    ```
    maxScore - minScore = 4 - 4 = 0
    ```

#### **Output**

```typescript
0
```
