[2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome-by-concatenating-two-letter-words/)
 
# Intuition

To form a palindrome, we need to **balance matching pairs around a center**, where each pair mirrors another (like `"lc"` + `"cl"`).  
Additionally, a **single symmetric word** (like `"gg"`, `"cc"`, etc.) can serve as the center of the palindrome if it occurs at least once.

# Approach  

1. **Count frequency** of each word in the `words` array using a hashmap.
2. Initialize `length = 0` to track total palindrome length and a boolean `hasMiddle = false`.
3. Iterate through each word and its frequency:
   - If the word is **not symmetric** (e.g., `"ab"` ≠ `"ba"`), check if its **reverse exists** in the map.
     - Use `min(freq[word], freq[reversed])` to count how many pairs you can form.
     - Add `pairCount * 4` to length (each pair adds 4 characters).
     - Subtract used pairs from both word and reverse in the frequency map.
   - If the word is **symmetric** (e.g., `"gg"`, `"cc"`), then:
     - Use as many pairs as possible: `pairs = Math.floor(freq[word] / 2)`
     - Add `pairs * 4` to the total length
     - If there's an **extra unused symmetric word**, it can be used in the **middle**, so set `hasMiddle = true`.
4. If `hasMiddle` is `true`, add `2` to the final length to account for the center word.

# Complexity Analysis  

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - `n` is the length of the `words` array  
  - We make a single pass to count and another to process
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  - For the frequency map

# Code

```ts
function longestPalindrome(words: string[]): number {
	const freq = new Map<string, number>();
    let length = 0;
    let hasMiddle = false;

    for (const word of words) {
        freq.set(word, (freq.get(word) || 0) + 1);
    }

    for (const [word, count] of freq.entries()) {
        const reversed = word[1] + word[0];

        if (word !== reversed && freq.has(reversed)) {
            const pairCount = Math.min(freq.get(word)!, freq.get(reversed)!);
            length += pairCount * 4;
            freq.set(word, freq.get(word)! - pairCount);
            freq.set(reversed, freq.get(reversed)! - pairCount);
        }
    }

    for (const [word, count] of freq.entries()) {
        if (word[0] === word[1]) {
            const pairs = Math.floor(count / 2);
            length += pairs * 4;
            if (count % 2 === 1) hasMiddle = true;
        }
    }

    if (hasMiddle) {
        length += 2;
    }

    return length;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### Example 1  
```ts
Input: ["lc", "cl", "gg"]
Output: 6
Explanation:
- Pair "lc" with "cl" → adds 4
- "gg" is symmetric and used as center → adds 2
- Total = 6
```

#### Example 2  
```ts
Input: ["ab", "ty", "yt", "lc", "cl", "ab"]
Output: 8
Explanation:
- Pair "ty" with "yt" → adds 4
- Pair "lc" with "cl" → adds 4
- One "ab" remains unused (no reverse left), so total = 8
```

#### Example 3  
```ts
Input: ["cc", "ll", "xx"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- All are symmetric, but no pairs
- Choose any one as center → adds 2
```

### **Summary**  
This greedy strategy ensures the **maximum use of mirrored pairs** and **at most one symmetric center word**, guaranteeing the **longest possible palindrome**.
