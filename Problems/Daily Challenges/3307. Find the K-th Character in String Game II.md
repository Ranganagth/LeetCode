[3307. Find the K-th Character in String Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-ii/)

### Problem Summary

Alice starts with a string `word = "a"` and performs a series of operations on it:
* **Operation 0:** Append the string to itself.
  * `"a"` → `"aa"`
* **Operation 1:** Transform each character to the next alphabet character (e.g. `'a'` → `'b'`, `'z'` → `'a'`), then append this new string to the original.
  * `"a"` → `"ab"`
  * `"zb"` → `"zbac"`

Given an array of such operations and a large index `k` (up to `10^14`), return the **k-th character (1-based index)** in the final `word`.

---

# Intuition

We **cannot build the entire string** because its size can be huge (`>10^14` characters).
Instead, we use **reverse reasoning** to **trace the origin** of the character at position `k`.

Each operation transforms the string but in a **recursive pattern**:

* `op = 0`: doubles the current string by appending itself.
* `op = 1`: appends the *incremented version* of the current string.

At each stage, the string doubles in size (always). So we can **simulate the operations backward**, tracking whether `k` lies in the first or second half of the resulting string:

* If `k` is in the **first half**, it comes from the original string.
* If in the **second half**, it comes from the added part, so we shift `k` to the corresponding position in the original.

For `op = 1`, if we move into the added section, we **increment** the result by 1 (the characters were incremented by one). We keep track of how many times this happens, as each counts as a letter shift.

---

# Approach

* Work **backwards** from the last operation to the beginning.
* Start with `k` (convert to 0-based index).
* Each time you go back one operation:
  * Determine if `k` was in the **first or second half** of the string.
  * If it’s in the **second half**:
    * Subtract the first half's length to normalize `k`.
    * If the operation was `1`, **increment the shift counter** (i.e., track how many times the character must be incremented).
* At the end, start from `'a'` and shift it `shift % 26` times.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** `O(log k + n)`, where `n = operations.length` (at most 100)
* **Space:** `O(1)`

Efficient even for large `k`.

# Code

```ts
function kthCharacter(k: number, operations: number[]): string {
    let shift = 0;
    let len = 1n;
    const opLength = operations.length;

    // Precompute length of string after each operation
    const lengths: bigint[] = [1n];
    for (let i = 0; i < opLength; i++) {
        len *= 2n;
        lengths.push(len);
    }

    let index = BigInt(k - 1); // 0-based indexing

    for (let i = operations.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const half = lengths[i];

        if (index >= half) {
            index -= half;
            if (operations[i] === 1) {
                shift++;
            }
        }
    }

    return String.fromCharCode(
        ("a".charCodeAt(0) + (shift % 26)) % 256
    );
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

```ts
Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]
```

* `"a"` → `"aa"` → `"aaaa"` → `"aaaaaaaa"`
* `k = 5` → character at index `4` is `'a'`
* No `op=1`, so no shift → return `'a'`

#### Example 2:

```ts
Input: k = 10, operations = [0,1,0,1]
```

Steps:

* `"a"` → `"aa"`
* → `"aabb"` (append `'b'`s, `op=1`)
* → `"aabbaabb"`
* → `"aabbaabbbbccbbcc"` (append incremented string, `op=1`)
* k = 10 → 0-based index = 9
* Backtrack to find if 9 falls in original or appended part
* Count `op=1` encountered in path to that character → shift = 1
* Start from `'a'`, shift by 1 → `'b'`

**Output: `'b'`**

---

### **Summary**

* Avoids memory and time overhead by tracing operations **in reverse**
* Efficiently finds the `k-th` character even when the string grows exponentially
* Handles huge `k` values (`≤ 10^14`) without building the full string
