[145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)

# Intuition

The postorder traversal visits the nodes in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root. To achieve a postorder traversal iteratively, we can modify the approach used for iterative preorder and inorder traversals. The key idea is to simulate the call stack used in recursive postorder traversal using an explicit stack.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an empty result array to store the node values in postorder.
   - Initialize a stack to help traverse the nodes iteratively.
   - Initialize a variable `lastVisited` to keep track of the last node that was added to the result array.

2. **Traversal Logic**:
   - Start from the root node and push it onto the stack.
   - Loop through the stack while it is not empty:
     - Peek at the top node of the stack.
     - If the current node has no children or its children have already been visited, pop it from the stack and add its value to the result array.
     - Otherwise, if the current node has right and/or left children that haven't been visited, push them onto the stack in the reverse order of their visitation (right child first, then left child).

3. **Output**:
   - After all nodes have been visited and processed, return the result array containing the postorder traversal of the binary tree.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** in the worst case. The space required by the stack is linear with respect to the number of nodes in the tree.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function postorderTraversal(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    if (root === null) return [];
    
    const result: number[] = [];
    const stack: TreeNode[] = [];
    let lastVisited: TreeNode | null = null;
    let current: TreeNode | null = root;
    
    while (current !== null || stack.length > 0) {
        while (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        }
        
        let peekNode = stack[stack.length - 1];
        
        if (peekNode.right === null || peekNode.right === lastVisited) {
            result.push(peekNode.val);
            lastVisited = stack.pop()!;
        } else {
            current = peekNode.right;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty array `result` to store the node values in postorder, an empty stack `stack` to help with the iterative traversal, and variables `lastVisited` to keep track of the last node visited.

2. **Traversal**:
   - We start from the `root` node and traverse down the left subtree, pushing each node onto the stack.
   - When we reach a leaf node or a node whose left subtree has been processed, we check if the node has a right subtree:
     - If the right subtree doesn't exist or has already been visited (`peekNode.right === lastVisited`), we pop the node from the stack, add its value to the `result`, and mark it as `lastVisited`.
     - Otherwise, we move to the right child and continue the process.
   - This ensures that nodes are added to the result in the correct postorder sequence.

3. **Result**: After processing all nodes, the `result` array contains the values of the binary tree nodes in postorder.
