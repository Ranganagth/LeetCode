[781. Rabbits in Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/rabbits-in-forest/)

# Intuition

When a rabbit says **`x`**, it means there are **`x` other rabbits** with the same color, so **`x + 1` rabbits in total** of that color (including itself).  

If **multiple rabbits** give the same answer `x`, they can be part of the **same group of size `x + 1`**, **but** no more than `x + 1` rabbits can give the same answer and belong to the same group.

So, for each answer, we group rabbits into groups of size `x + 1`.

# Approach

1. Count the frequency of each answer using a hashmap.
2. For each unique answer `x`:
   - If `count` rabbits gave answer `x`, then each group has size `x + 1`.
   - We need `ceil(count / (x + 1))` such groups to cover all rabbits that said `x`.
   - So total rabbits from this answer = `groups * (x + 1)`
3. Sum all these values to get the **minimum number of rabbits in the forest**.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` — where `n` is the number of answers (maximum 1000).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` — for the hashmap to store answer frequencies.

# Code

```ts
function numRabbits(answers: number[]): number {
    const freq = new Map<number, number>();

    for (let ans of answers) {
        freq.set(ans, (freq.get(ans) || 0) + 1);
    }

    let total = 0;

    for (let [x, count] of freq.entries()) {
        const groupSize = x + 1;
        const groups = Math.ceil(count / groupSize);
        total += groups * groupSize;
    }

    return total;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**  
**Input**: `answers = [1,1,2]`  
- Rabbits say:
  - Two rabbits say `1` → meaning group of 2 (1 + 1).
    - 2 rabbits fit in 1 group of 2 → need 2 rabbits.
  - One rabbit says `2` → needs a group of 3 (2 + 1).
    - Only 1 rabbit gave this, but we assume a group of 3 must exist → need 3 rabbits.

**Output**: `2 + 3 = 5`

#### **Example 2**  
**Input**: `answers = [10,10,10]`
- Each says `10` → means groups of 11
- 3 rabbits → all can fit in 1 group of 11

**Output**: `11`

### **Summary**

This is a classic **grouping and greedy counting** problem where we interpret constraints given by each rabbit and build minimal consistent groups to satisfy all responses.
