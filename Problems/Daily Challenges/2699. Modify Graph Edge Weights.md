[2699. Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://leetcode.com/problems/modify-graph-edge-weights/)

# Intuition

The problem involves modifying certain edges in a graph to achieve a target shortest path distance between two nodes. By leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm, we can adjust the weights of edges that initially have a weight of `-1` to find the shortest path equal to the given target. The challenge is to modify these weights while ensuring the path remains shortest and valid.

# Approach

1. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Start by implementing Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from the source to the destination node.
  
2. **Initial Check:** If the shortest path is already less than the target distance, it is impossible to modify the edges to meet the target, so we return an empty array.

3. **Edge Modification:** Iterate through the edges with a weight of `-1`. Adjust the weights and run Dijkstra’s algorithm again to check if the target distance can be achieved. If achieved, update the edge weights accordingly.

4. **Final Validation:** If a path is found that equals the target distance, return the modified edges; otherwise, return an empty array.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the solution primarily depends on the Dijkstra algorithm, which is **O(n²)** for `n` nodes when using an adjacency matrix. Since we may need to run Dijkstra’s multiple times (in worst-case scenarios), the complexity becomes ***O(m * n²)*** where `m` is the number of edges.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is ***O(n²)*** due to the adjacency matrix used in Dijkstra’s algorithm.

# Code:

```typescript
function modifiedGraphEdges(n: number, edges: number[][], source: number, destination: number, target: number): number[][] {
    const INF = 2e9;

    const dijkstra = (edges: number[][]): number => {
        const graph: number[][] = Array(n)
            .fill(0)
            .map(() => Array(n).fill(INF));
        const dist: number[] = Array(n).fill(INF);
        const visited: boolean[] = Array(n).fill(false);

        for (const [from, to, weight] of edges) {
            if (weight === -1) continue;
            graph[from][to] = weight;
            graph[to][from] = weight;
        }

        dist[source] = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            let closestNode = -1;
            for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (!visited[j] && (closestNode === -1 || dist[j] < dist[closestNode])) {
                    closestNode = j;
                }
            }
            visited[closestNode] = true;

            for (let neighbor = 0; neighbor < n; ++neighbor) {
                dist[neighbor] = Math.min(dist[neighbor], dist[closestNode] + graph[closestNode][neighbor]);
            }
        }

        return dist[destination];
    };

    let shortestDistance = dijkstra(edges);

    if (shortestDistance < target) return [];

    let pathFound = shortestDistance === target;

    for (const edge of edges) {
        if (edge[2] > 0) continue;

        if (pathFound) {
            edge[2] = INF;
            continue;
        }

        edge[2] = 1;
        shortestDistance = dijkstra(edges);

        if (shortestDistance <= target) {
            pathFound = true;
            edge[2] += target - shortestDistance;
        }
    }

    return pathFound ? edges : [];
};
