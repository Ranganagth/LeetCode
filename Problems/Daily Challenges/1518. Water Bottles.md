[1518. Water Bottles](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-bottles/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of drinking and exchanging water bottles until no more exchanges can be made. Each full bottle we drink turns into an empty bottle, and every time we have enough empty bottles, we can exchange them for more full bottles. We continue this process until the number of empty bottles is less than the number needed for an exchange.

# Approach

1. **Initialize**:
   - Start with the initial number of full bottles (`numBottles`).
   - Set up counters for the total bottles drunk and the current number of empty bottles.

2. **Simulation**:
   - While the number of full bottles is greater than zero:
     - Drink all the full bottles, which adds to the total bottles drunk.
     - Convert the drunk bottles into empty bottles.
     - Check if the number of empty bottles is enough to exchange for new full bottles.
     - If so, calculate the number of new full bottles and update the number of empty bottles accordingly.
   - Continue this process until no more exchanges can be made.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log(numBottles))*** because with each exchange the number of bottles decreases significantly.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we use a constant amount of additional space.

# Code
```typescript
function numWaterBottles(numBottles: number, numExchange: number): number {
    let totalDrunk = 0;
    let emptyBottles = 0;

    while (numBottles > 0) {
        totalDrunk += numBottles;
        emptyBottles += numBottles;

        numBottles = Math.floor(emptyBottles / numExchange);
        emptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchange;
    }

    return totalDrunk;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `totalDrunk` keeps track of the total number of bottles drunk.
   - `emptyBottles` counts the empty bottles we have at any given time.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are full bottles to drink (`numBottles > 0`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - Add the number of full bottles to `totalDrunk` and update `emptyBottles`.
     - Calculate the number of new full bottles we can get by exchanging empty bottles.
     - Update `emptyBottles` to reflect the leftover empty bottles after exchanging.
