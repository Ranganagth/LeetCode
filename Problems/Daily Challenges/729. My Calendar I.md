[729. My Calendar I](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/)

# Intuition

To manage event bookings without causing double bookings, we need a way to efficiently check whether a new event overlaps with any existing events in the calendar. The key is to ensure that when adding a new event defined by a half-open interval *[start, end)*, no other event's interval intersects with it. 

# Approach

1. **Data Structure**: 
   - Use a list (array) to store existing bookings as pairs of start and end times. This allows us to iterate through the bookings to check for overlaps.

2. **Checking for Overlaps**: 
   - To determine if a new event can be booked, we need to check that it does not overlap with any existing events. An event defined by *[start, end)* will overlap with an existing event *[existingStart, existingEnd)* if:
     - *start < existingEnd* and *existingStart < end*

3. **Booking an Event**: 
   - If no overlaps are found after checking all existing bookings, add the new event to the list and return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Each booking requires iterating through the list of existing bookings, leading to a time complexity of *O(n)* for each booking, where *n* is the number of existing bookings. In the worst case, this could be***O(k^2)*** for*k* bookings.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** for storing the existing bookings.

# Code:

```typescript
class MyCalendar {
    private bookings: [number, number][];

    constructor() {
        this.bookings = [];
    }

    book(start: number, end: number): boolean {
        for (const [existingStart, existingEnd] of this.bookings) {
            if (start < existingEnd && existingStart < end) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        this.bookings.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Class Initialization**: 
   - The `MyCalendar` class initializes an empty list called `bookings` to store the booked events.

2. **Book Method**:
   - The `book` method takes `start` and `end` parameters representing the new event's time range.
   - It iterates through each existing booking and checks if there is an overlap using the condition discussed.
   - If an overlap is detected, it returns `false`. If no overlaps are found, it adds the new booking to the list and returns `true`.

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**:

```plaintext
Input: ["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
       [[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Call `MyCalendar()`. An instance is created with an empty bookings array: `[]`.

2. **First Booking**: 
   - Call `book(10, 20)`.
   - No existing bookings to check against, so it adds *[10, 20)* to the list and returns `true`.
   - Bookings now: `[[10, 20]]`.

3. **Second Booking**: 
   - Call `book(15, 25)`.
   - Check against *[10, 20)*:
     - *15 < 20* (true) and *10 < 25* (true) → overlap found.
   - It returns `false` without adding the booking.
   - Bookings remain: `[[10, 20]]`.

4. **Third Booking**: 
   - Call `book(20, 30)`.
   - Check against \([10, 20)\):
     - *20 < 20* (false) and *10 < 30* (true) → no overlap.
   - It adds [20, 30) 0to the list and returns `true`.
   - Bookings now: `[[10, 20], [20, 30]]`.

### Final Output
The resulting output for the calls is: `[null, true, false, true]`. 

- The first call returns `null` (constructor), 
- The second returns `true`, 
- The third returns `false`, 
- The fourth returns `true`.
