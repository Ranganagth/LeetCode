[416. Partition Equal Subset Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/)
# Intuition

This problem is a variation of the **Subset Sum Problem**.

We are asked to determine if we can split the array into **two subsets with equal sum**.  
If the total sum of all elements is **odd**, we can immediately return `false` because two equal integers cannot sum to an odd number.

If the total is even, then the problem reduces to:  
_Can we find a subset whose sum is `total / 2`?_

This is a classic **0/1 Knapsack** problem — we choose whether to include each number to reach a target sum.


# Approach

1. **Calculate total sum** of the array.
2. If total sum is **odd**, return `false`.
3. Let `target = total / 2`.
4. Use **dynamic programming** with a boolean `dp` array of size `target + 1`, where `dp[s]` means:  
    → Is it possible to form a subset with sum `s`?
5. Initialize `dp[0] = true` (subset sum of 0 is always possible).
6. Iterate through each `num` in `nums`:
    - Update the `dp` array **backwards** from `target` to `num`, to avoid using the same number multiple times.
7. At the end, return `dp[target]`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * target)`  
    where `n = nums.length`, and `target = total / 2`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(target)`  
    We use a 1D array to optimize space from a 2D solution.

# Code

```ts
function canPartition(nums: number[]): boolean {
  const total = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);

  // If total sum is odd, we can't split it into two equal parts
  if (total % 2 !== 0) return false;

  const target = total / 2;
  const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(false);
  dp[0] = true; // base case

  for (const num of nums) {
    for (let s = target; s >= num; s--) {
      dp[s] = dp[s] || dp[s - num];
    }
  }

  return dp[target];
}
```

### **Example**

#### **Input**:

```ts
nums = [1, 5, 11, 5]
```

- `sum = 22` → target = `11`
    
- Subsets: [1, 5, 5] and [11]
    

#### **Output**: `true`

#### **Input**:

```ts
nums = [1, 2, 3, 5]
```
- `sum = 11` → odd → **can't split equally**    

#### **Output**: `false`

## Summary

- Convert problem to a **subset sum** decision problem.
- If we can form a subset with `sum = total / 2`, then the array can be partitioned.
- Use **dynamic programming** for efficient computation.

This method ensures we cover all possibilities without checking each subset explicitly, which would be exponential.
