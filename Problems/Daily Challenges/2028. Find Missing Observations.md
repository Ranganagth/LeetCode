[2028. Find Missing Observations](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-observations/)

# Intuition

We are tasked with finding the missing observations from a series of dice rolls such that the overall mean of all rolls (including both the known and the missing ones) equals a given value. To solve this, we need to calculate the total sum of the missing rolls and ensure that their values fall within the valid range for dice rolls (1 to 6).

# Approach

1. **Calculate the Total Sum of All Rolls**:
   - The mean is given as the average of all `n + m` rolls. Therefore, the total sum of all `n + m` rolls is `mean * (n + m)`.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Known Rolls**:
   - Sum up the values from the `rolls` array to get the total sum of the observed rolls.

3. **Determine the Sum of the Missing Rolls**:
   - The sum of the missing rolls must be the difference between the total sum of all rolls and the sum of the observed rolls. This gives us the total sum we need to distribute among the `n` missing dice.

4. **Check for Validity**:
   - The missing dice values must be between 1 and 6. Thus, the total sum of the missing rolls should lie within the range `[n, 6 * n]`. If the calculated sum falls outside this range, it's impossible to distribute the values, and we return an empty array.

5. **Distribute the Sum**:
   - If a solution is possible, distribute the sum across the `n` missing rolls by initially assigning each missing roll a value of 1, and then incrementing them as needed to achieve the target sum.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Calculating the sum of the known rolls takes **O(m)** time.
  - Distributing the sum across the missing rolls takes **O(n)** time.
  - So, the overall time complexity is ***O(n + m)***.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - We need ***O(n)*** space to store the missing rolls.

# Code:

```typescript
function missingRolls(rolls: number[], mean: number, n: number): number[] {
    const m = rolls.length;
    const totalSum = mean * (n + m);
    const currentSum = rolls.reduce((acc, roll) => acc + roll, 0);
    const missingSum = totalSum - currentSum;

    if (missingSum < n || missingSum > 6 * n) {
        return [];
    }

    const result = Array(n).fill(1);
    let remainingSum = missingSum - n;

    for (let i = 0; i < n && remainingSum > 0; i++) {
        const increment = Math.min(5, remainingSum);
        result[i] += increment;
        remainingSum -= increment;
    }

    return result;
};

```
## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(missingRolls([3,2,4,3], 4, 2));  // Output: [6,6]
console.log(missingRolls([1,5,6], 3, 4));    // Output: [2,3,2,2]
console.log(missingRolls([1,2,3,4], 6, 4));  // Output: []
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Calculations**:
   - We compute the total sum of all `n + m` rolls as `mean * (n + m)`.
   - We subtract the sum of the known rolls (`rolls`) to determine how much total sum we need from the missing `n` rolls.

2. **Validity Check**:
   - The sum of the missing rolls should be between `n` (if all missing rolls are 1) and `6 * n` (if all missing rolls are 6). If the required sum is outside this range, it's impossible to distribute it, and we return an empty array.

3. **Distribution**:
   - We initialize each missing roll with a value of 1 and then distribute the remaining sum among them by incrementing values up to a maximum of 6.
