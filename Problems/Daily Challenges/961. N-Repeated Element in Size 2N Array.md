[961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/)

### Problem reduces to: 

In an array of length **2n** with **n+1 distinct values**, the duplicated value appears **n times** — meaning it shows up *everywhere*. The fastest path is to detect the repeated element as soon as we see it.

---

# Intuition

If one value appears in half the array, then after scanning only a few elements we will inevitably encounter it twice. A simple hash set catches the first duplicate immediately.

---

# Approach

Scan left-to-right, keep a set of seen numbers.
On each number:

* If it’s already in the set → that number is the answer.
* Otherwise insert it and continue.

This works because only the repeated element can appear twice.

---

# Complexity

- **Time:** *O(n)*
- **Space:** *O(n)*

---

# Code

```ts
function repeatedNTimes(nums: number[]): number {
    const seen = new Set<number>();

    for (const x of nums) {
        if (seen.has(x)) return x;
        seen.add(x);
    }

    return -1; // logically unreachable
};

```

---

# Example walkthrough

**nums** = [2,1,2,5,3,2]
seen = {}
see 2 → add
see 1 → add
see 2 again → already in set → answer = 2
