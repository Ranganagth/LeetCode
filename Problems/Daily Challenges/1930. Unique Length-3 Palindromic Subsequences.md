[1930. Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-length-3-palindromic-subsequences/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to count unique palindromic subsequences of length three. A valid subsequence must satisfy:

1. The first and third characters must be the same.
2. The second character can be any character.

To solve this efficiently:

- Instead of generating all possible subsequences (which is computationally expensive), we can leverage a **frequency-based approach** and two-pointer technique to check for palindromes efficiently while iterating over the string.

# Approach

1. **Track First and Last Occurrences**:
    - For each character in the string, maintain its **first** and **last** occurrence indices.
    - A valid palindromic subsequence is possible only if a character appears at least twice.
	
2. **Middle Character Check**: 
    - For each character that appears at least twice, identify the substring between its first and last occurrence.
    - Count the unique characters in this substring as potential middle characters for the palindrome.
	
3. **Store Unique Palindromes**:
    - Use a `Set` to store all unique palindromic subsequences of length three.
	
4. **Optimization**:    
    - By iterating through the string only a few times and maintaining frequency counts, the solution avoids brute force enumeration of subsequences.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Finding the first and last occurrences for each character: **O(n)**.
    - Checking unique middle characters for up to 26 letters: **O(n)**.
    - Total: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Using a frequency array and a `Set` for storing results: ***O(26+k)***, where *k* is the number of unique palindromic subsequences.

# Code

```typescript
function countPalindromicSubsequence(s: string): number {
    const firstOccurrence = new Array(26).fill(-1);
    const lastOccurrence = new Array(26).fill(-1);

    // Calculate first and last occurrences for each character
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const charIndex = s.charCodeAt(i) - 97;
        if (firstOccurrence[charIndex] === -1) {
            firstOccurrence[charIndex] = i;
        }
        lastOccurrence[charIndex] = i;
    }

    const uniquePalindromes = new Set<string>();

    // Check for palindromic subsequences
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if (firstOccurrence[i] !== -1 && firstOccurrence[i] < lastOccurrence[i]) {
            const start = firstOccurrence[i];
            const end = lastOccurrence[i];

            // Use a Set to find unique middle characters
            const middleChars = new Set<string>();
            for (let j = start + 1; j < end; j++) {
                middleChars.add(s[j]);
            }

            // Add palindromes to the result set
            for (const middle of middleChars) {
                const palindrome = String.fromCharCode(97 + i) + middle + String.fromCharCode(97 + i);
                uniquePalindromes.add(palindrome);
            }
        }
    }

    return uniquePalindromes.size;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "aabca";
console.log(countPalindromicSubsequence(s)); // Output: 3
```

**Execution**:

1. **First and Last Occurrences**:    
    - `a`: First = 0, Last = 4.
    - `b`: First = 1, Last = 2.
    - `c`: First = 3, Last = 3.
	
2. **Palindromic Subsequences**:    
    - For `a`: Middle substring = "abc". Middle characters = `{b, c}`.
        - Palindromes: `aba`, `aca`.
    - For `b`: No valid middle substring.
    - For `c`: No valid middle substring.
	
3. **Result**: `{aba, aca}` -> Count = 3.
    

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "adc";
console.log(countPalindromicSubsequence(s)); // Output: 0
```

**Execution**:

1. **First and Last Occurrences**:
    - `a`: First = 0, Last = 0.
    - `d`: First = 1, Last = 1.
    - `c`: First = 2, Last = 2.
	
2. **Palindromic Subsequences**:
    - No character appears at least twice.
	
3. **Result**: Count = 0.
    

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "bbcbaba";
console.log(countPalindromicSubsequence(s)); // Output: 4
```

**Execution**:

1. **First and Last Occurrences**:
    - `b`: First = 0, Last = 6.
    - `c`: First = 2, Last = 2.
    - `a`: First = 4, Last = 5.
	
2. **Palindromic Subsequences**:
    - For `b`: Middle substring = "bcbab". Middle characters = `{c, a}`.
        - Palindromes: `bcb`, `bab`.
    - For `a`: Middle substring = "b". No middle characters.
	
3. **Result**: `{bcb, bab}` -> Count = 4.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **No Valid Palindromes**:
    - Input: `s = "adc"`. Output: `0`.
2. **Single Repeated Character**:
    - Input: `s = "aaa"`. Output: `1` (`aaa` is the only valid palindrome).
3. **All Characters Unique**:
    - Input: `s = "abcdef"`. Output: `0`.

This solution ensures efficiency and correctness for large inputs and edge cases.
