[632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/)

# Intuition:

The task is to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the `k` sorted lists. We define a range `[a, b]` and aim to minimize the difference between `b - a` while ensuring that one element from each list falls within this range.

### Key Observations:
1. Since each list is sorted, the smallest range can be found by considering combinations of values from different lists and updating the range as we explore them.
2. We can flatten all the lists and treat them as individual values while keeping track of their corresponding list index.
3. The challenge is to maintain a window that includes at least one element from each list and to slide this window over the sorted elements to find the smallest range.

# Approach:

This problem can be solved using a **sliding window** technique over a sorted list of values combined with their corresponding list index. The idea is:
1. **Flatten and Sort**: Combine all elements from the lists into a single array of tuples `(value, list_index)`, then sort the array by value.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use two pointers (`startWindow` and `endWindow`) to form a window over the sorted elements. The goal is to expand the window by moving the `endWindow` and shrink it by moving the `startWindow` while ensuring that the window contains at least one element from each list.
3. **Map to Track Groups**: Maintain a count of how many elements from each list are currently in the window using a hash map. If the map contains an element from every list, it means the current window is valid, and we can compute the range.
4. **Minimize the Range**: Every time a valid window is found (i.e., one that contains at least one element from each list), update the minimum range if the current one is smaller.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Flattening the lists takes **O(n)**, where *n* is the total number of elements across all lists.
  - Sorting the flattened list takes **O(n log n)**.
  - Sliding the window over the sorted elements and maintaining the hash map takes **O(n)**.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is ***O(n log n)***.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - We store the flattened list of size *n*, and the hash map has a size of *k*, so the space complexity is ***O(n)***.

# Code:

```typescript
function smallestRange(nums: number[][]): number[] {
    const totalElements = nums.reduce((acc, group) => acc + group.length, 0);

    const sortedElements: [number, number][] = new Array(totalElements);

    let index = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        for (const value of nums[i]) {
            sortedElements[index++] = [value, i];
        }
    }

    sortedElements.sort(([val1], [val2]) => val1 - val2);

    let startWindow = 0;
    const groupCount = new Map<number, number>();

    let range: number[] = [-1000000, 1000000];

    for (let endWindow = 0; endWindow < totalElements; ++endWindow) {
        const [currentValue, currentGroup] = sortedElements[endWindow];

        groupCount.set(currentGroup, (groupCount.get(currentGroup) || 0) + 1);

        while (groupCount.size === nums.length) {
            const [windowStartValue, windowStartGroup] = sortedElements[startWindow];

            const currentRange = currentValue - windowStartValue;
            const bestRange = range[1] - range[0];
            if (currentRange < bestRange || (currentRange === bestRange && windowStartValue < range[0])) {
                range = [windowStartValue, currentValue];
            }

            const startGroupCount = groupCount.get(windowStartGroup)! - 1;
            if (startGroupCount === 0) {
                groupCount.delete(windowStartGroup);
            } else {
                groupCount.set(windowStartGroup, startGroupCount);
            }

            startWindow++;
        }
    }

    return range;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `nums = [[4,10,15,24,26],[0,9,12,20],[5,18,22,30]]`

1. **Flatten the Lists**:
   - Combine the elements of all the lists along with their list indices:
     - `[ [4, 0], [10, 0], [15, 0], [24, 0], [26, 0], [0, 1], [9, 1], [12, 1], [20, 1], [5, 2], [18, 2], [22, 2], [30, 2] ]`
   
2. **Sort the Elements**:
   - After sorting based on the values, we get:
     - `[ [0, 1], [4, 0], [5, 2], [9, 1], [10, 0], [12, 1], [15, 0], [18, 2], [20, 1], [22, 2], [24, 0], [26, 0], [30, 2] ]`

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - Start with an empty window and add elements one by one while tracking how many elements from each list are in the window.
   - After processing elements `[0, 4, 5]`, the window contains one element from each list (`0` from list 1, `4` from list 0, and `5` from list 2), so the current range is `[0, 5]`.
   - As we continue expanding the window, we check and update the range.
   - Eventually, the smallest range `[20, 24]` is found because:
     - List 0 contributes `24`, list 1 contributes `20`, and list 2 contributes `22`.

**Output**: `[20, 24]`

### Explanation:
- We start by flattening and sorting all the numbers, and then use a sliding window approach to maintain a valid window that contains at least one number from each list.
- The sliding window moves over the sorted array, adjusting its size to find the smallest range.
