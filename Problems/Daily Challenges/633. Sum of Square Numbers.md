[633. Sum of Square Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-square-numbers/)

# Intuition

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Since *a* and *b* are non-negative integers and *a²* and *b²* must add up to *c*, we can use two pointers:
    - One pointer (`a`) starts from 0.
    - The other pointer (`b`) starts from *√c*.

2. **Adjust Pointers**: 
    - If *a² + b²* equals *c*, we've found our solution.
    - If *a² + b²* is less than *c*, increment `a` to increase the sum.
    - If *a² + b²* is greater than *c*, decrement `b` to decrease the sum.

# Approach

1. Initialize two pointers, `a` to 0 and `b` to *√c*.
2. Loop until `a` exceeds `b`:
   - Calculate *sum = a² + b²* .
   - If `sum` equals `c`, return `true`.
   - If `sum` is less than `c`, increment `a`.
   - If `sum` is greater than `c`, decrement `b`.
3. If no such pair is found, return `false`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(√c)***, because both pointers move in the range from 0 to *√c*).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function judgeSquareSum(c: number): boolean {
    let a = 0;
    let b = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(c));

    while (a <= b) {
        const sum = a * a + b * b;
        if (sum === c) {
            return true;
        } else if (sum < c) {
            a++;
        } else {
            b--;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start with `a = 0` and `b = √c`.
2. **Looping**: We loop while `a` is less than or equal to `b`. In each iteration:
   - Compute *sum = a² + b²*.
   - Check if `sum` matches `c`.
   - Adjust `a` or `b` based on whether `sum` is less than or greater than `c`.
3. **Result**: If we find such *a* and *b*, we return `true`. If the loop ends without finding such a pair, we return `false`.
