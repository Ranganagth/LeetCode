[3133. Minimum Array End](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-end/)

# Intuition

The core idea behind this solution is to start with the number `x` and gradually build a larger number by carefully setting certain bits to ensure that:
- The bitwise AND of all elements in the sequence is still `x`.
- The sequence is strictly increasing, and we generate the smallest possible number for `nums[n-1]`.

# Approach

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialize and Decrement `n`:**
   - We decrement `n` to get `n-1`, as we will work with this value in the bit manipulation process.
   - Convert `x` into a `BigInt` to handle larger numbers and to ensure we avoid integer overflow.

2. **Iterate Over Bit Positions:**
   - For each bit position from `0` to `30` (since the problem works within a 32-bit integer range):
     - We check if the current bit in `x` is `1` or `0` using bitwise operations (`(x >> i) & 1`).
     - If the bit is `0` in `x`, we try to set it to the corresponding bit of `n`. This ensures the resulting number is as large as necessary for the sequence but still satisfies the AND condition with `x`.

3. **Handle Remaining Bits:**
   - After the loop, the remaining bits are handled by directly shifting `n` and OR'ing them into the result.

4. **Return the Final Result:**
   - Convert the `BigInt` result back into a regular `number` to return the final answer.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The main loop runs for a constant number of iterations (up to `31`), as we are iterating over the 32-bit representation of numbers.
   - The overall time complexity is ***O(1)*** because the number of iterations is constant and independent of the actual size of `n` or `x`.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is also ***O(1)***, as we only use a few variables to store intermediate results.

# Code

```typescript
function minEnd(n: number, x: number): number {
    --n;
    let ans: bigint = BigInt(x);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 31; ++i) {
        if (((x >> i) & 1) ^ 1) {
            ans |= BigInt(n & 1) << BigInt(i);
            n >>= 1;
        }
    }

    ans |= BigInt(n) << BigInt(31);

    return Number(ans);
};

```

### Explanation Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `n = 3`, `x = 4`

1. **Decrement `n`:**  
   We first decrement `n` to `2`. 

2. **Bitwise Iteration:**  
   We start with `x = 4`, which in binary is `100`.  
   - **First iteration (`i = 0`):** The least significant bit of `x` is `0`. We look at the least significant bit of `n = 2` (binary `10`), which is `0`. We set the bit in the result.
   - **Second iteration (`i = 1`):** The second least significant bit of `x` is `0`, and the second least significant bit of `n = 2` is `1`. We set this bit in the result.
   - **Third iteration (`i = 2`):** The third least significant bit of `x` is `1`, so no modification is needed.

3. **Final result:**  
   The final result after the loop is `6`, which satisfies the conditions.

Thus, `nums = [4, 5, 6]`, and the last element is `6`.

#### Example 2: `n = 2`, `x = 7`

1. **Decrement `n`:**  
   We decrement `n` to `1`.

2. **Bitwise Iteration:**  
   We start with `x = 7`, which in binary is `111`.  
   - **First iteration (`i = 0`):** The least significant bit of `x` is `1`, so no modification is needed.
   - **Second iteration (`i = 1`):** The second least significant bit of `x` is `1`, so no modification is needed.
   - **Third iteration (`i = 2`):** The third least significant bit of `x` is `1`, so no modification is needed.

3. **Final result:**  
   The final result is `7`.

Thus, `nums = [7, 15]`, and the last element is `15`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently handles the problem, ensuring that the bitwise AND condition is satisfied while generating the smallest possible last element in the sequence. The use of `BigInt` allows the solution to handle very large values for `x` and `n` without overflow issues.
