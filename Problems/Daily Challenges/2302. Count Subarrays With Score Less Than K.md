[2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k/)

# Intuition

The score is defined as `(sum of elements in subarray) * (length of subarray)`.  
We want to find how many subarrays have their score **strictly less** than `k`.

Because the array can be very large (`n <= 10^5`), we cannot check every subarray naively (`O(n^2)`).  
Instead, we use **two pointers** (sliding window) to efficiently find all valid subarrays.

The key idea is:
- Expand the window by moving the right pointer.
- If the current window's score becomes **>= k**, move the left pointer to shrink the window until it becomes valid again.
- For each valid window ending at `right`, the number of new subarrays is `(right - left + 1)`.

# Approach

1. Initialize `left = 0`, `sum = 0`, `count = 0`.
2. Iterate `right` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Add `nums[right]` to the current `sum`.
   - While the current score `sum * (right - left + 1)` is **>= k**, shrink from the left:
     - Subtract `nums[left]` from `sum`.
     - Move `left` to `left + 1`.
   - After making sure the window is valid, add `(right - left + 1)` to the `count`.
3. Return the final `count`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, each element is added and removed from the sum at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, constant extra space used.

# Code

```ts
function countSubarrays(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        sum += nums[right];

        while (left <= right && sum * (right - left + 1) >= k) {
            sum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }

        count += (right - left + 1);
    }

    return count;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

**Input**: `nums = [2,1,4,3,5]`, `k = 10`

- Right = 0 → sum = 2
  - Score = 2 * 1 = 2 (< 10)
  - Add (0 - 0 + 1) = 1 to count → count = 1
- Right = 1 → sum = 2 + 1 = 3
  - Score = 3 * 2 = 6 (< 10)
  - Add (1 - 0 + 1) = 2 to count → count = 3
- Right = 2 → sum = 3 + 4 = 7
  - Score = 7 * 3 = 21 (> 10)
    - Shrink: sum -= 2 → sum = 5, left = 1
    - Score = 5 * 2 = 10 (== 10)
    - Shrink: sum -= 1 → sum = 4, left = 2
    - Score = 4 * 1 = 4 (< 10)
  - Add (2 - 2 + 1) = 1 to count → count = 4
- Right = 3 → sum = 4 + 3 = 7
  - Score = 7 * 2 = 14 (> 10)
    - Shrink: sum -= 4 → sum = 3, left = 3
    - Score = 3 * 1 = 3 (< 10)
  - Add (3 - 3 + 1) = 1 to count → count = 5
- Right = 4 → sum = 3 + 5 = 8
  - Score = 8 * 2 = 16 (> 10)
    - Shrink: sum -= 3 → sum = 5, left = 4
    - Score = 5 * 1 = 5 (< 10)
  - Add (4 - 4 + 1) = 1 to count → count = 6

**Output**: `6`

#### Example 2:

**Input**: `nums = [1,1,1]`, `k = 5`

- Right = 0 → sum = 1
  - Score = 1 * 1 = 1 (< 5)
  - Add (0 - 0 + 1) = 1 → count = 1
- Right = 1 → sum = 1 + 1 = 2
  - Score = 2 * 2 = 4 (< 5)
  - Add (1 - 0 + 1) = 2 → count = 3
- Right = 2 → sum = 2 + 1 = 3
  - Score = 3 * 3 = 9 (> 5)
    - Shrink: sum -= 1 → sum = 2, left = 1
    - Score = 2 * 2 = 4 (< 5)
  - Add (2 - 1 + 1) = 2 → count = 5

**Output**: `5`

### **Summary**

Using the two-pointers technique optimizes the solution to linear time.  
By maintaining a valid window where the score remains less than `k`, we can efficiently count all eligible subarrays.
