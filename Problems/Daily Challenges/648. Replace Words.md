[648. Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)

# Intuition
1. **Trie Data Structure**: A Trie is useful for this problem because it allows for fast prefix searching. We can insert all the roots into a Trie and then for each word in the sentence, we can search for the shortest root prefix efficiently.
2. **Sentence Processing**: Split the sentence into words, check each word against the Trie to find the shortest root, and replace the word with the root if found.
3. **Efficient Replacement**: The Trie allows us to stop the search early as soon as we find the first root that matches the prefix of a word.

# Approach
1. **Build the Trie**:
   - Insert each root from the dictionary into the Trie.
2. **Process the Sentence**:
   - Split the sentence into words.
   - For each word, search for the shortest root in the Trie.
   - Replace the word with the found root.
3. **Reconstruct the Sentence**:
   - Join the processed words back into a sentence.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Building the Trie takes ***O(m × n)*** where `m` is the number of roots and `n` is the average length of the roots. Processing each word in the sentence against the Trie takes ***O(k × l)*** where `k` is the number of words in the sentence and `l` is the average length of the words.
- **Space Complexity**: The space required for the Trie is ***O(m × n)***.

# Code
```typescript
class TrieNode {
    children: { [key: string]: TrieNode };
    isEndOfWord: boolean;

    constructor() {
        this.children = {};
        this.isEndOfWord = false;
    }
}

class Trie {
    root: TrieNode;

    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }

    insert(word: string): void {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children[char]) {
                node.children[char] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[char];
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    searchShortestPrefix(word: string): string {
        let node = this.root;
        let prefix = '';
        for (const char of word) {
            if (node.isEndOfWord) {
                return prefix;
            }
            if (!node.children[char]) {
                return '';
            }
            prefix += char;
            node = node.children[char];
        }
        return node.isEndOfWord ? prefix : '';
    }
}

function replaceWords(dictionary: string[], sentence: string): string {
    const trie = new Trie();
    for (const root of dictionary) {
        trie.insert(root);
    }

    const words = sentence.split(' ');
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        const prefix = trie.searchShortestPrefix(words[i]);
        if (prefix) {
            words[i] = prefix;
        }
    }

    return words.join(' ');
};

```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **TrieNode and Trie Classes**: These classes define the Trie data structure. The `insert` method inserts a word into the Trie, and the `searchShortestPrefix` method searches for the shortest prefix of a given word in the Trie.
2. **replaceWords Function**:
   - Constructs the Trie from the dictionary.
   - Splits the sentence into words and checks each word against the Trie to find the shortest root.
   - Replaces the word with the found root and joins the words back into a sentence.
