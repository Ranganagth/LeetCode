[2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries/)

# Intuition
The problem involves removing subtrees in a binary tree based on a series of independent queries and calculating the height of the remaining tree for each query. Since queries are independent, each tree reverts to its original state after each query. To make the process efficient, we can pre-compute the necessary heights of subtrees and their maximums.

# Approach
1. **Depth and Range Calculation**:
   - Use a DFS (depth-first search) to calculate the depth of each node and mark the range (start and end indices) for each node’s subtree in a `heights` array.
   - Store each node’s depth in the `d` array, and map the range of positions within the `heights` array using `l` (left boundary) and `r` (right boundary) arrays.
   - If a node has no children, store its height directly in the `heights` array; otherwise, store the height of each child node.

2. **Pre-compute Max Heights from Left and Right**:
   - Construct two arrays, `maxl` and `maxr`, to store the maximum heights seen from the left and right directions of each subtree.
   - Iterate through the `heights` array to fill `maxl` with maximum values seen from the start to the current index and `maxr` with maximum values from the end to the current index.

3. **Process Queries**:
   - For each query, find the maximum height available if the subtree at that node is removed.
   - Using the precomputed `l`, `r`, `maxl`, and `maxr`, calculate the maximum height left outside of the queried subtree and store the result for each query.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***
  - DFS traversal of the tree to compute depths and ranges takes ***O(n)***.
  - Filling `maxl` and `maxr` also takes ***O(n)***.
  - Each query is processed in ***O(1)*** due to pre-computed values.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for arrays `d`, `l`, `r`, `heights`, `maxl`, and `maxr`.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val = 0, left: TreeNode | null = null, right: TreeNode | null = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function treeQueries(root: TreeNode, queries: number[]): number[] {
    const heights: number[] = new Array(50000).fill(0);
    const d: number[] = new Array(100001).fill(0);
    const l: number[] = new Array(100001).fill(0);
    const r: number[] = new Array(100001).fill(0);
    let len = 0;

    function search(p: TreeNode, h: number): void {
        d[p.val] = h;

        if (!p.left && !p.right) {
            heights[len] = h;
            l[p.val] = r[p.val] = len;
            len++;
            return;
        }

        l[p.val] = len;

        if (p.left) search(p.left, h + 1);
        if (p.right) search(p.right, h + 1);

        r[p.val] = len - 1;
    }

    search(root, 0);

    const n = len;
    const maxl: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const maxr: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        maxl[i] = Math.max(maxl[i - 1], heights[i - 1]);
        maxr[n - i - 1] = Math.max(maxr[n - i], heights[n - i]);
    }

    const ret: number[] = [];
    const k = queries.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        const queryVal = queries[i];
        const maxxl = maxl[l[queryVal]];
        const maxxr = maxr[r[queryVal]];
        ret.push(Math.max(Math.max(maxxl, maxxr), d[queryVal] - 1));
    }

    return ret;
}
```

### Example Walkthrough
Consider the input `root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7]` and `queries = [4]`:

1. **Initial DFS (`search` function)**:
   - Traverse the tree to calculate the depth of each node and mark the subtree ranges using `l` and `r`.
   - The `heights` array stores the maximum depth of each leaf node for quick access.

2. **Fill `maxl` and `maxr`**:
   - For each position in `heights`, calculate the maximum heights from the left (`maxl`) and from the right (`maxr`).

3. **Process Each Query**:
   - For query `4`, calculate the max height outside the subtree rooted at `4`.
   - Since the subtree of `4` is removed, the remaining maximum height is stored in `ret`.

### Explanation of Results
- The `treeQueries` function will return an array of tree heights after each subtree removal specified in `queries`.
