[1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
To find the smallest level such that the sum of all the values of nodes at that level is maximal, we can perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree while keeping track of the sum of each level's values. Then, we return the level with the maximum sum.

---

# Approach
1. **Level-Order Traversal**: Perform a level-order traversal of the binary tree using BFS.
2. **Track Level Sums**: Keep track of the sum of each level's values while traversing.
3. **Find Maximum Sum Level**: After traversal, identify the level with the maximum sum.
4. **Return Smallest Level**: Return the level number with the maximum sum.

# Complexity 

- The time complexity for this approach is ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We traverse each node once during the BFS traversal. 
- The space complexity is also ***O(n)***, where ***n*** is the maximum number of nodes at any level of the binary tree (the maximum size of the queue during BFS).

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function maxLevelSum(root: TreeNode | null): number {
    if (!root) return 0;

    let maxLevel = 0;
    let maxSum = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;

    const queue: TreeNode[] = [root];
    let level = 1;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelSize = queue.length;
        let levelSum = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            levelSum += node.val;

            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }

        if (levelSum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = levelSum;
            maxLevel = level;
        }

        level++;
    }

    return maxLevel;
};

```

## In this implementation:

- We start with level 1 and iterate over each level using a BFS approach.
- We keep track of the sum of each level's values and update the maximum sum and corresponding level whenever we encounter a level with a greater sum.
- Finally, we return the level with the maximum sum.
