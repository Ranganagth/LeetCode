[3396. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Elements in Array Distinct](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-elements-in-array-distinct/)

# Intuition

To make the array elements **distinct**, we need to **remove duplicates**.  
The only operation allowed is **removing the first 3 elements** of the array.

The idea is to remove blocks of 3 from the front **until the remaining array has all unique elements.**

Since we can only remove from the **front**, the best strategy is to:

- **Try all possible prefixes** removed in chunks of 3 (0, 3, 6, ...),
- And check **how many operations** are needed to make the remaining suffix distinct.
    
We are to find the **minimum number of such operations**.

# Approach

1. Start with `0` operations.
2. While the current array has duplicates:
    - Remove the **first 3 elements**.
    - Increase operation count.
3. Stop when remaining elements are distinct or array becomes empty.
    
We use a **Set** to check for uniqueness in the suffix.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n²)` worst case — since in each step we:
    - Slice the array (O(n))
    - And check for uniqueness (O(n))
        
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for using a Set
    
This is acceptable for the constraint `n ≤ 100`.

# Code

```ts
function minOperationsToMakeDistinct(nums: number[]): number {
  let operations = 0;

  while (nums.length > 0) {
    const set = new Set(nums);
    if (set.size === nums.length) return operations;
    
    // Remove the first 3 elements (or less if not enough)
    nums = nums.slice(Math.min(3, nums.length));
    operations++;
  }

  return operations;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]
```

- Remove [1,2,3] → [4,2,3,3,5,7]
- Remove [4,2,3] → [3,5,7] 
- Remaining is distinct → **Output: 2**
   

### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: [4,5,6,4,4]
```

- Remove [4,5,6] → [4,4]
- Remove [4,4] → [] 
- Empty array is valid →  **Output: 2**
   

### **Example 3**

```ts
Input: [6,7,8,9]
```

Already distinct → **Output: 0**

# Summary

- The trick is to simulate removing 3 elements at a time from the start until what’s left is unique.
- A **greedy + set-based check** is enough given the small size limit.
- The operation simulates a "sliding cut" from the front to reach the first valid suffix.
