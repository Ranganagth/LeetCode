[916. Word Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-subsets/)

# Intuition

The problem involves determining which strings in `words1` are universal, meaning they satisfy the condition of being supersets for all strings in `words2`. To solve this efficiently:

1. A string bb is a subset of string *a* if for every character in *b*, the count of that character in *a* is greater than or equal to the count in *b*.
2. For all strings in `words2`, we can calculate the maximum count of each character required across all strings and use this as a "minimum requirement" to check universality.

# Approach

1. **Calculate Character Requirements for `words2`**:
    - Combine the character requirements of all strings in `words2` by taking the maximum count of each character across all strings in `words2`.
	
2. **Check Each String in `words1`**:
    - For each string in `words1`, check if it meets the character requirements derived from `words2`.
	
3. **Optimization Using Frequency Arrays**:
    - Use frequency arrays of size 26 (one for each letter) to count character occurrences, which is efficient for the small alphabet size.
	
4. **Result**:    
    - Return the strings in `words1` that meet the universality condition.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Constructing the frequency array for `words2`: *O(L₂)*, where *L₂* is the total number of characters in `words2`.
    - Checking each string in `words1`: *O(L₁)*, where *L₁* is the total number of characters in `words1`.
    - Overall: ***O(L₁+L₂)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:   
    - ***O(26)*** for the frequency arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function wordSubsets(words1: string[], words2: string[]): string[] {
    const charCount = (word: string): number[] => {
        const count = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (const char of word) {
            count[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        return count;
    };

    // Get the maximum character frequency requirements from words2
    const maxFreq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (const word of words2) {
        const freq = charCount(word);
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            maxFreq[i] = Math.max(maxFreq[i], freq[i]);
        }
    }

    // Check universality for each word in words1
    const result: string[] = [];
    for (const word of words1) {
        const freq = charCount(word);
        let isUniversal = true;

        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] < maxFreq[i]) {
                isUniversal = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isUniversal) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"];
const words2 = ["e", "o"];
console.log(wordSubsets(words1, words2)); // Output: ["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
```

**Execution**:

1. Compute maxFreq for `words2`:
    - "e": frequency array = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]
    - "o": frequency array = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]
    - Combined maxFreq: [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0]
	
2. Check each string in `words1`:
    - `"amazon"`: Does not meet "o".
    - `"apple"`: Does not meet "o".
    - `"facebook"`: Meets both "e" and "o".
    - `"google"`: Meets both "e" and "o".
    - `"leetcode"`: Meets both "e" and "o".

**Output**:

```typescript
["facebook", "google", "leetcode"]
```

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const words1 = ["amazon", "apple", "facebook", "google", "leetcode"];
const words2 = ["l", "e"];
console.log(wordSubsets(words1, words2)); // Output: ["apple", "google", "leetcode"]
```

**Execution**:

1. Compute maxFreq for `words2`:
    - "l": frequency array = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]
    - "e": frequency array = [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0]
    - Combined maxFreq: [0, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, ..., 0]
	
2. Check each string in `words1`:
    - `"amazon"`: Does not meet "l".
    - `"apple"`: Meets both "l" and "e".
    - `"facebook"`: Does not meet "l".
    - `"google"`: Meets both "l" and "e".
    - `"leetcode"`: Meets both "l" and "e".

**Output**:

```typescript
["apple", "google", "leetcode"]
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **No Universal Strings**:
    - Input: `words1 = ["a", "b"]`, `words2 = ["c"]`.
    - Output: `[]`.
	
2. **All Universal Strings**:
    - Input: `words1 = ["abc", "abcd"]`, `words2 = ["a", "b"]`.
    - Output: `["abc", "abcd"]`.
	
3. **Empty `words2`**:
    - Input: `words1 = ["abc", "abcd"]`, `words2 = []`.
    - Output: `["abc", "abcd"]`.
