[1395. Count Number of Teams](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of forming valid teams of three soldiers, we need to consider all possible combinations of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k`. For each combination, we check if the ratings form a valid sequence (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).

# Approach

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Iterate over all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` where `0 <= i < j < k < n`.
   - Check if the ratings form a valid team.
   - Count the number of valid teams.

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - For each soldier at index `j`, we count how many soldiers before `j` have a rating less than `rating[j]` and how many soldiers after `j` have a rating greater than `rating[j]` to form an increasing triplet.
   - Similarly, we count how many soldiers before `j` have a rating greater than `rating[j]` and how many soldiers after `j` have a rating less than `rating[j]` to form a decreasing triplet.
   - Sum up all the valid triplets.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(nÂ²)*** where *n* is the length of the rating array. This is because we are iterating over each pair of indices `(i, k)` for every `j`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using only a few additional variables for counting.

# Code

```typescript
function numTeams(rating: number[]): number {
    const n = rating.length;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        let lessBefore = 0;
        let moreBefore = 0;
        let lessAfter = 0;
        let moreAfter = 0;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < j; i++) {
            if (rating[i] < rating[j]) {
                lessBefore++;
            } else if (rating[i] > rating[j]) {
                moreBefore++;
            }
        }
        
        for (let k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
            if (rating[k] < rating[j]) {
                lessAfter++;
            } else if (rating[k] > rating[j]) {
                moreAfter++;
            }
        }
        
        count += lessBefore * moreAfter + moreBefore * lessAfter;
    }
    
    return count;
};

```

### Example usage

```Typescript
console.log(numTeams([2,5,3,4,1])); // Output: 3
console.log(numTeams([2,1,3])); // Output: 0
console.log(numTeams([1,2,3,4])); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the length of the rating array.
   - `count` is the variable that keeps track of the number of valid teams.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - Iterate over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Inner Loops**:
   - First inner loop counts soldiers before `j`:
     - `lessBefore` counts soldiers with ratings less than `rating[j]`.
     - `moreBefore` counts soldiers with ratings greater than `rating[j]`.
   - Second inner loop counts soldiers after `j`:
     - `lessAfter` counts soldiers with ratings less than `rating[j]`.
     - `moreAfter` counts soldiers with ratings greater than `rating[j]`.

4. **Count Valid Teams**:
   - `lessBefore * moreAfter` gives the number of increasing triplets with `rating[j]` as the middle element.
   - `moreBefore * lessAfter` gives the number of decreasing triplets with `rating[j]` as the middle element.

5. **Return Result**:
   - The total count of valid teams is returned.
