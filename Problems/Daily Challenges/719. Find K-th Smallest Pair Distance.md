[719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/)

# Intuition:
1. **Sorting**: By sorting the array, we can ensure that the smallest distances will be between elements that are closer together in value.
2. **Binary Search**: We can perform a binary search on the possible distance values, checking for each middle value how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to that value.
3. **Two Pointers**: For each candidate distance, we use two pointers to count the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to the current distance in our binary search.

# Approach:
1. **Sort the array**: First, sort the `nums` array.
2. **Binary Search on the Distance**: Define the search space for possible distances between `0` and `max(nums) - min(nums)`.
3. **Count the number of pairs with a distance less than or equal to the mid-point of the current search space**: This can be done efficiently using the two-pointer technique.
4. **Narrow down the search space**: Based on the count of pairs with a distance less than or equal to the midpoint, adjust the binary search range.
5. **Return the smallest distance that has exactly `k` pairs**.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Sorting takes *O(n log n)*. The binary search runs in *O(log(max distance) * n)*, and within each binary search step, counting pairs with two pointers takes *O(n)*. So, the overall complexity is ***O(n log n + n log(max distance))***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space (ignoring the space required for sorting).

# Code:

```typescript
function smallestDistancePair(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b); 
    
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];
    
    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let count = 0;
        let j = 0;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (j < nums.length && nums[j] - nums[i] <= mid) {
                j++;
            }
            count += j - i - 1; 
        }
        
        if (count >= k) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 3, 1], 1));  // Output: 0
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 1, 1], 2));  // Output: 0
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 6, 1], 3));  // Output: 5
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: We start by sorting the array, which allows us to efficiently compute distances between adjacent elements.
- **Binary Search**: We use binary search to find the minimum distance that has exactly `k` pairs with smaller or equal distances.
- **Two Pointers**: For each candidate distance during the binary search, we count how many pairs have a distance less than or equal to that candidate using a two-pointer technique.
