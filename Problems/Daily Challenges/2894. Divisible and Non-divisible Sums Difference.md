[2894. Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisible-and-non-divisible-sums-difference/)

# Intuition

We are to compute two sums over the range `[1, n]`:
* `num1`: sum of numbers **not divisible** by `m`
* `num2`: sum of numbers **divisible** by `m`

Instead of iterating over every number twice, we can use the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers:
$$
\text{sum}(1 \ldots n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

Next, calculate the sum of all numbers divisible by `m`:
* The numbers divisible by `m` up to `n` are: `m, 2m, 3m, ..., km` where `k = Math.floor(n / m)`
* Their sum is:
$$
\text{sum of multiples of m} = m \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
$$

Thus:
* `num1 = totalSum - divisibleSum`
* `num2 = divisibleSum`
* Return: `num1 - num2 = totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum`

# Approach

1. Compute total sum from 1 to `n`
2. Compute how many numbers ≤ `n` are divisible by `m`
3. Compute the sum of these divisible numbers
4. Subtract `2 × divisibleSum` from `totalSum`

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(1)`
  All computations are done using constant-time formulas.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

# Code

```ts
function differenceOfSums(n: number, m: number): number {
    const totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;

    const k = Math.floor(n / m);
    const divisibleSum = m * (k * (k + 1)) / 2;

    return totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: n = 10, m = 3
```

* Total sum: 1+2+...+10 = 55
* Numbers divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9 → count = 3
* Sum of divisible = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
  → Or, using formula: 3 × (3×4)/2 = 18
* `num1 = 55 - 18 = 37`, `num2 = 18`
* Output: `37 - 18 = 19`

#### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: n = 5, m = 6
```

* Total sum = 15
* No numbers divisible by 6 in \[1,5] → divisible sum = 0
* Output = 15 - 0 = 15

#### **Example 3**

```ts
Input: n = 5, m = 1
```

* All numbers are divisible by 1
* Total sum = 15
* Divisible sum = 15
* Output = 15 - 2×15 = -15

### **Summary**

This problem can be solved efficiently using arithmetic formulas without looping, making it optimal even for large `n`. The key is recognizing how to isolate sums based on divisibility using math.
