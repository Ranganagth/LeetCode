[2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-k-of-each-character-from-left-and-right/)

# Intuition
This problem involves collecting at least *k* of each character ('a', 'b', 'c') from a string *s*, where characters can only be taken from the leftmost or rightmost ends. 

The key insight is to determine the smallest "gap" of characters in the middle of the string that can be excluded to meet the condition of having at least *k* of each character. This can be efficiently achieved using a **sliding window** (or two-pointer) technique:
1. Count the total number of each character in the string.
2. Use a sliding window to determine the maximum length of a middle substring that **does not need** to be removed to meet the conditions.
3. Calculate the minimal characters needed from the left and right ends based on the remaining characters after excluding the middle window.

# Approach

1. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Use a frequency map to count the total number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in *s*.
   - If any of these counts are less than *k*, return `-1` as it's impossible to meet the condition.

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to iterate through the string while keeping track of character counts in the window.
   - Calculate how many of each character remain outside the window (left + right ends).
   - If the remaining counts for 'a', 'b', and 'c' satisfy *k*, update the minimum window size.

3. **Calculate Result**:
   - The minimum number of characters taken from the left and right is *total length* - *max window size*.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***
  - The sliding window ensures every character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***
  - The space is constant for character counts.

# Code

```typescript
function takeCharacters(s: string, k: number): number {
    const n = s.length;

    // Step 1: Count total occurrences of 'a', 'b', 'c'
    const totalCount = { a: 0, b: 0, c: 0 };
    for (const char of s) {
        totalCount[char]++;
    }

    // If any character count is less than k, it's impossible
    if (totalCount['a'] < k || totalCount['b'] < k || totalCount['c'] < k) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Step 2: Sliding window to find the largest valid middle window
    let start = 0;
    let maxWindowSize = 0;
    const currentCount = { a: 0, b: 0, c: 0 };

    for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        currentCount[s[end]]++;

        // Ensure the window satisfies the condition
        while (
            totalCount['a'] - currentCount['a'] < k ||
            totalCount['b'] - currentCount['b'] < k ||
            totalCount['c'] - currentCount['c'] < k
        ) {
            currentCount[s[start]]--;
            start++;
        }

        // Update the maximum window size
        maxWindowSize = Math.max(maxWindowSize, end - start + 1);
    }

    // Step 3: Calculate the minimal minutes required
    return n - maxWindowSize;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
**Input**: `s = "aabaaaacaabc"`, `k = 2`  
**Steps**:
1. **Total Counts**: 
   - *'a' = 7, 'b' = 2, 'c' = 3*.
   - All counts are *≥k = 2*, so proceed.
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Expand the window and calculate remaining counts.
   - Max valid window size = *4* (e.g., substring `"aaac"`).
3. **Result**:
   - *n - maxWindowSize = 12 - 4 = 8*.

**Output**: `8`

#### Example 2
**Input**: `s = "a"`, `k = 1`  
**Steps**:
1. **Total Counts**: 
   - *'a' = 1, 'b' = 0, 'c' = 0*.
   - *'b' < k*, so return `-1`.

**Output**: `-1`

#### Example 3
**Input**: `s = "abcabc"`, `k = 1`  
**Steps**:
1. **Total Counts**: 
   - *'a' = 2, 'b' = 2, 'c' = 2*.
   - All counts are *≥k = 1*, so proceed.
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Max valid window size = *3* (e.g., substring `"abc"`).
3. **Result**:
   - *n - maxWindowSize = 6 - 3 = 3* .

**Output**: `3`

### Key Insights
1. The sliding window efficiently narrows down the middle substring that doesn't contribute to the character requirement.
2. The problem is feasible only if all character counts are *≥k*.
3. By focusing on the excluded middle, we minimize the effort required to collect *k* characters.
