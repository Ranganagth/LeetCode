[1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of placing books on shelves to minimize the total height of the bookshelf, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to determine the minimum possible height of the bookshelf by considering all possible ways of placing the books on the shelves, while keeping track of the best (minimum height) configuration at each step.

# Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum height of the bookshelf that can be achieved using the first `i` books.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0]` to 0, as the height of a bookshelf with zero books is zero.

3. **Iterate through the books**: For each book, we determine if we can place it on the current shelf or start a new shelf.

4. **Inner Loop for Shelf Calculation**:
   - Use a nested loop to consider placing the last few books on the current shelf.
   - Keep track of the total thickness and the maximum height of the books on the current shelf.
   - Update the `dp` array by considering the minimum height configuration.

5. **Update DP**: For each position `i`, update `dp[i]` by considering the height if the current book and previous books (up to the shelf width limit) are placed on the same shelf.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n²)***, where *n* is the number of books. This is because for each book, we might need to check up to `n` previous books.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, as we need a DP array of size `n`.

# Code

```typescript
function minHeightShelves(books: number[][], shelfWidth: number): number {
    const n = books.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let width = 0;
        let height = 0;
        dp[i] = Number.MAX_VALUE;
        for (let j = i; j > 0; j--) {
            width += books[j - 1][0];
            if (width > shelfWidth) break;
            height = Math.max(height, books[j - 1][1]);
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + height);
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

```

## Example usage

```typescript
console.log(minHeightShelves([[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], 4)); // Output: 6
console.log(minHeightShelves([[1,3],[2,4],[3,2]], 6)); // Output: 4
```

### Explanation of Examples

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelfWidth = 4`
   - The books can be placed on three shelves as follows:
     - Shelf 1: [1,1], [2,3] → height = 3
     - Shelf 2: [2,3] → height = 3
     - Shelf 3: [1,1], [1,1], [1,1], [1,2] → height = 2
   - Total height = 3 + 3 + 2 = 6
   - Output: `6`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `books = [[1,3],[2,4],[3,2]], shelfWidth = 6`
   - The books can be placed on two shelves as follows:
     - Shelf 1: [1,3], [2,4] → height = 4
     - Shelf 2: [3,2] → height = 2
   - Total height = 4 + 2 = 4
   - Output: `4`
