[1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/)
# Intuition

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - We represent the graph using an adjacency matrix where `dist[i][j]` holds the shortest distance between city `i` and city `j`.
   - Initialize the matrix with infinity (`Infinity`) for all pairs except the diagonal, which should be `0` (distance from a node to itself).

2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - This algorithm iteratively updates the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes using intermediate nodes.
   - After applying Floyd-Warshall, `dist[i][j]` will contain the shortest distance between city `i` and city `j`.

3. **Counting Reachable Cities**:
   - For each city, count the number of other cities that can be reached within the given distance threshold.
   - Track the city with the smallest number of reachable cities. If there's a tie, choose the city with the greatest number.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `dist` matrix and initialize it based on the given edges.
   
2. **Run Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the `dist` matrix to reflect the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
   
3. **Count Reachable Cities**:
   - For each city, count the cities that can be reached within the distance threshold.
   - Determine the city with the smallest count, breaking ties by choosing the city with the greatest number.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n³)***, due to the triple nested loops in the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)***, for storing the distance matrix.

# Code

```typescript
function findTheCity(n: number, edges: number[][], distanceThreshold: number): number {
    const INF = Infinity;
    const dist: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(INF));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }

    for (const [from, to, weight] of edges) {
        dist[from][to] = weight;
        dist[to][from] = weight;
    }

    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let minReachableCities = n;
    let resultCity = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let reachableCities = 0;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i !== j && dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                reachableCities++;
            }
        }
        if (reachableCities < minReachableCities || (reachableCities === minReachableCities && i > resultCity)) {
            minReachableCities = reachableCities;
            resultCity = i;
        }
    }

    return resultCity;
};
