[2779. Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-beauty-of-an-array-after-applying-operation/)

# Intuition:

To solve this problem efficiently, we aim to maximize the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements after performing the operations. The operation allows us to replace an element with any value in a specific range. The challenge is to find how to group numbers in a way that we maximize the number of elements within the same range, thereby maximizing the subsequence of equal elements.

To achieve this, we can model the problem using a **difference array**:
- We keep track of how many times we can modify an element to fall within a specific range of values.
- By using a difference array, we can efficiently calculate the count of each possible value in the range after applying the operation.

# Approach:

1. **Difference Array Technique**:    
    - Instead of directly manipulating the array, we maintain a difference array that helps track the changes in frequency of numbers after performing the allowed operations.
    - The difference array is used to efficiently count how many values in the array can be modified to fall within a specific range of values.
2. **Sliding Window on the Range**:
    - For each number in the array, we know that after applying the operation, it can take any value in the range [num - k, num + k].
    - We increment the frequency for all values within that range in the difference array.
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - After updating the difference array, we compute the cumulative sum (prefix sum). This gives us the total count of numbers that can be transformed to any specific value.
    - The maximum of this cumulative sum gives the length of the longest subsequence of equal elements (i.e., the beauty of the array).
4. **Maximize the Beauty**:    
    - We keep track of the maximum subsequence length found across all ranges.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Constructing the difference array involves iterating over the `nums` array, which takes ***O(n)***, where *n* is the size of the array.
    - Calculating the prefix sum involves iterating over the range of possible values (bounded by `max(nums) + 2 * k`), which in the worst case is O(3 * 10^5), given that `nums[i]` and `k` can be as large as 10^5.
    - Total complexity: ***O(n + M)***, where *M* is the range size (at most `3 * 10^5`).
	
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The space complexity is ***O(M)***, where M is the size of the difference array (which is proportional to the maximum possible range of values after applying the operation).

# Code:

```typescript
function maximumBeauty(nums: number[], operationsAllowed: number): number {
    // Calculate the maximum boundary for possible values in nums after operations.
    const maxBoundary = Math.max(...nums) + operationsAllowed * 2 + 2;
    
    // Initialize a difference array to track frequencies of numbers.
    const differenceArray: number[] = new Array(maxBoundary).fill(0);

    // Update the difference array based on the operation range for each number.
    for (const num of nums) {
        // Increment the count for the range [num - operationsAllowed, num + operationsAllowed]
        differenceArray[num]++;
        // Decrement at the boundary where the range ends for this number.
        differenceArray[num + operationsAllowed * 2 + 1]--;
    }

    let maxBeauty = 0;  // Variable to store the maximum beauty found.
    let sum = 0;        // Accumulator to track the running sum (cumulative frequency).

    // Calculate the prefix sum to find the maximum beauty.
    for (const frequency of differenceArray) {
        sum += frequency;
        maxBeauty = Math.max(maxBeauty, sum);
    }

    // Return the maximum beauty found.
    return maxBeauty;
}
```

### **Example Walkthrough**:

#### **Example 1**:

**Input**:
```typescript
nums = [4,6,1,2];
operationsAllowed = 2;
```

**Execution**:
- We calculate the maximum boundary as `max(4, 6, 1, 2) + 2 * 2 + 2 = 10`.
- We initialize the difference array and apply the allowed operations.
- After applying the operations, the difference array shows how the counts for possible values evolve.
- We calculate the prefix sum, and the maximum beauty (longest subsequence of equal elements) is found to be 3.

**Output**:
```typescript
3
```

#### **Example 2**:

**Input**:
```typescript
nums = [1,1,1,1];
operationsAllowed = 10;
```

**Execution**:
- All elements are already equal, and no operations are needed.
- The beauty is 4 because the entire array is already a subsequence of equal elements.

**Output**:
```typescript
4
```

### **Key Insights**:

- The problem can be efficiently solved using the difference array method, which allows for quick calculation of ranges and their respective frequencies.
- The sliding window (prefix sum) approach helps in efficiently tracking the maximum subsequence that can be formed.
- This approach avoids the need to repeatedly check individual subsequences and directly works with the frequency of values after applying the allowed operations.
