[3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/)

# Intuition

We're given a string `s`, and we need to compute:

* The frequency of each character.
* Identify characters with **odd frequencies** (`a₁`) and **even frequencies** (`a₂`).
* Compute all possible differences `a₁ - a₂` where `a₁` is from odd frequencies and `a₂` is from even frequencies.
* Return the **maximum** of such differences.

# Approach

1. Count frequencies of all characters using a map or array of size 26.
2. Separate the frequencies into:
   * `oddFreqs`: list of all frequencies that are **odd**.
   * `evenFreqs`: list of all frequencies that are **even**.
3. For each pair `(a1 in oddFreqs, a2 in evenFreqs)`, calculate `a1 - a2`.
4. Return the maximum such difference.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(26 + o * e) = O(1), since max number of characters is 26 (a-z)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) for frequency array

# Code

```typescript
function maxDifference(s: string): number {
    const freq = new Array(26).fill(0);

    for (const ch of s) {
        freq[ch.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
    }

    const oddFreqs: number[] = [];
    const evenFreqs: number[] = [];

    for (const f of freq) {
        if (f === 0) continue;
        if (f % 2 === 0) {
            evenFreqs.push(f);
        } else {
            oddFreqs.push(f);
        }
    }

    let maxDiff = -Infinity;
    for (const a1 of oddFreqs) {
        for (const a2 of evenFreqs) {
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, a1 - a2);
        }
    }

    return maxDiff;
}
```

### **Example Walkthroughs**

#### **Example 1**

* **Input:** `s = "aaaaabbc"`
* Frequencies:

  * `a: 5` (odd), `b: 2` (even), `c: 1` (odd)
* Odd frequencies: `[5, 1]`
* Even frequencies: `[2]`
* Pairs:

  * `5 - 2 = 3`
  * `1 - 2 = -1`
* **Output:** `3`

---

#### **Example 2**

* **Input:** `s = "abcabcab"`
* Frequencies:

  * `a: 3` (odd), `b: 3` (odd), `c: 2` (even)
* Odd: `[3, 3]`, Even: `[2]`
* Pairs:

  * `3 - 2 = 1`
* **Output:** `1`

### **Summary**

We leverage frequency counting and partition the counts into odd and even. By evaluating all valid (odd, even) pairs, we can easily find the max difference — and the operations remain efficient due to the bounded number of characters.
