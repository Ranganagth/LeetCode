[2658. Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-fish-in-a-grid/)

# Intuition

This problem involves finding the maximum sum of fish that can be collected by starting at any water cell in a grid and moving through adjacent water cells. Since the grid is small, a Depth First Search (DFS) approach is optimal for exploring all possible paths efficiently.

The intuition is to:
1. Start at each water cell and simulate the fisher’s movements.
2. Use DFS to explore all connected water cells from the starting cell, collecting fish as you go.
3. Track the total number of fish collected for each starting cell and return the maximum value.

# Approach

1. **Initialization:**
    - Traverse the grid and find all water cells (`grid[i][j] > 0`).
    - For each water cell, initiate a DFS to calculate the total fish that can be collected from that cell.
	
2. **Depth First Search (DFS):**
    - Start from the current cell and collect its fish count.
    - Mark the cell as visited by setting its value to 0 (to avoid revisiting during the same DFS).
    - Recursively move to all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) if they are valid water cells.
    - Accumulate the fish count and backtrack by restoring the original value of the cell.
	
3. **Maximization:**
    - Track the maximum fish count collected across all DFS explorations.
	
4. **Edge Case:**    
    - If no water cell exists (`grid` contains only 0s), return 0.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(m × n)***
    - Each cell is visited once during the DFS exploration for each connected water region.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(m × n)***
    - Due to the recursion stack in DFS, the space complexity is proportional to the number of cells in the largest connected water region.

# Code

```typescript
function findMaxFish(grid: number[][]): number {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let maxFish = 0;

    // Directions for adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)
    const directions = [
        [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]
    ];

    // Helper function to perform DFS
    function dfs(r: number, c: number): number {
        // If out of bounds or land cell, return 0
        if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || grid[r][c] === 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Collect fish from the current cell
        let fishCount = grid[r][c];
        grid[r][c] = 0; // Mark the cell as visited

        // Explore all adjacent cells
        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            fishCount += dfs(r + dr, c + dc);
        }

        return fishCount;
    }

    // Traverse the grid to find all water cells
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] > 0) { // Start DFS from each water cell
                maxFish = Math.max(maxFish, dfs(r, c));
            }
        }
    }

    return maxFish;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:**

```typescript
grid = [[0,2,1,0],
        [4,0,0,3],
        [1,0,0,4],
        [0,3,2,0]];
```

**Execution:**

1. Start DFS at cell `(1,3)`, collect 3 fish.
2. Move to `(2,3)`, collect 4 fish.
3. Total fish collected = *3 + 4 = 7*.
4. Explore other water cells, but none provide more than 7 fish.

**Output:** `7`

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:**

```typescript
grid = [[1,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,0],
        [0,0,0,1]];
```

**Execution:**

1. Start DFS at `(0,0)`, collect 1 fish.
2. Start DFS at `(3,3)`, collect 1 fish.
3. No connected cells exist, so *max = max⁡(1, 1) = 1*.

**Output:** `1`

#### **Edge Case:**

**Input:**

```typescript
grid = [[0,0],
        [0,0]];
```

**Output:** `0` (No water cells exist).

### **Summary:**

This approach efficiently uses DFS to explore connected water cells and calculate the maximum fish count possible from any starting point. The small grid size ensures the solution is computationally feasible.
