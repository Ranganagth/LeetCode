[1002. Find Common Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/)

# Intuition

1. **Frequency Counting**:
   - Use an array to count the frequency of each character in the first word.
   - For every subsequent word, update this frequency array to reflect only the characters that are common and their minimum counts across all words.

2. **Result Construction**:
   - Once we have the final frequency array representing the minimum frequency of each character across all words, we can construct the result.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Frequency Array**:
   - Use an array of size 26 (for each letter in the English alphabet) to store the frequency of each character in the first word.

2. **Update Frequency Array**:
   - For each subsequent word, create a temporary frequency array.
   - Update the main frequency array to keep only the minimum count of each character found in both arrays.

3. **Construct Result**:
   - Iterate over the frequency array and construct the result list based on the frequencies.

# Code
```typescript
function commonChars(words: string[]): string[] {
    const countFrequency = (word: string): number[] => {
        const freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (const char of word) {
            freq[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        return freq;
    }

    let commonFreq = countFrequency(words[0]);

    for (let i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
        const currentFreq = countFrequency(words[i]);
        for (let j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
            commonFreq[j] = Math.min(commonFreq[j], currentFreq[j]);
        }
    }

    const result: string[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        while (commonFreq[i] > 0) {
            result.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 'a'.charCodeAt(0)));
            commonFreq[i]--;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **countFrequency Function**:
   - This helper function takes a word and returns an array of size 26, where each index represents the frequency of a corresponding character ('a' to 'z').

2. **Initialization and Update**:
   - The `commonFreq` array is initialized with the frequency count of the first word.
   - For each subsequent word, a `currentFreq` array is created, and `commonFreq` is updated to keep the minimum frequency of each character between `commonFreq` and `currentFreq`.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - Iterate over the `commonFreq` array, and for each non-zero value, add the corresponding character to the result list the number of times it appears.
