[350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)

# Intuition

The problem asks us to find the intersection of two arrays, where each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays. This can be approached by using hash maps to count the occurrences of elements in both arrays and then determining the minimum count for each common element.

# Approach

1. **Count the Occurrences**: Use hash maps to count the occurrences of each element in both arrays.
2. **Find the Intersection**: Iterate through one of the hash maps and for each element, check if it exists in the other hash map. If it does, add the minimum count of that element to the result array.
3. **Return the Result**: The result array will contain the intersection of the two arrays as required.

### Steps:
1. Create two hash maps to store the frequency of each element in `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Iterate over the first array (`nums1`) and populate the first hash map.
3. Iterate over the second array (`nums2`) and populate the second hash map.
4. Create a result array to store the intersection.
5. Iterate through the first hash map, and for each element, check if it exists in the second hash map. If it does, add the minimum count of occurrences of that element to the result array.
6. Return the result array.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`. This is because we are iterating through both arrays once to populate the hash maps, and then iterating through one hash map to find the intersection.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n + m)*** for the hash maps used to store the frequency of elements in both arrays.

# Code

```typescript
function intersect(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number[] {
    const map1: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    const map2: Map<number, number> = new Map();
    const result: number[] = [];

    for (const num of nums1) {
        map1.set(num, (map1.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    for (const num of nums2) {
        map2.set(num, (map2.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    for (const [num, count] of map1.entries()) {
        if (map2.has(num)) {
            const minCount = Math.min(count, map2.get(num) as number);
            for (let i = 0; i < minCount; i++) {
                result.push(num);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

## Follow-up Questions

1. **If the given array is already sorted?**
   - If the arrays are sorted, we can use a two-pointer approach to find the intersection in O(n + m) time complexity without using extra space.

2. **If `nums1`'s size is small compared to `nums2`'s size?**
   - If `nums1` is significantly smaller than `nums2`, it might be more efficient to iterate through `nums1` and for each element, check its occurrences in `nums2` using a hash map or a similar structure.

3. **If elements of `nums2` are stored on disk and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?**
   - In this case, we can use a streaming approach, where we read `nums2` in chunks. For each chunk, we can update the frequency count and compute the intersection with `nums1` as we go. This ensures that we do not load all elements of `nums2` into memory at once.
