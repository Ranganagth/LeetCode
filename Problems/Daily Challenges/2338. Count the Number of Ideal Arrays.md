[2338. Count the Number of Ideal Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-ideal-arrays/)

# Intuition

We're asked to count **ideal arrays** of length `n` where:
- Every element is in the range `[1, maxValue]`
- Every next element is divisible by the previous one.

Since the divisibility rule must hold at every step, once a number is chosen in the array, the next number must be a multiple of it.

To avoid recomputing overlapping subproblems, we use **DFS with memoization**. And since the placement of values in an array of size `n` can be arranged in combinatorial ways, we use **combinatorics** (Pascal's Triangle) to speed up the counting.

# Approach

1. **Memoized DFS (`dfs(i, cnt)`)**:
   - Counts the number of valid arrays ending with value `i`, having `cnt` elements so far.
   - For base case, the number of ways to place `cnt` copies in `n` positions is `C(n-1, cnt-1)`.
   - Try extending the sequence by multiplying `i` by 2, 3, ..., as long as `i * k <= maxValue`.

2. **Combination Preprocessing**:
   - Use Pascal’s triangle to precompute binomial coefficients `C(n, k)` modulo `10^9 + 7`.
   - Required because once we fix the structure of values, the position arrangement is determined combinatorially.

3. **Final Result**:
   - Sum over all valid DFS results starting with numbers from `1` to `maxValue`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:  
  Approximately `O(maxValue * log(maxValue) * n)` due to DFS branching by multiples and memoization over `f[i][cnt]`.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  `O(maxValue * 16 + n * 16)` for memoization and combinations storage.

# Code

```ts
const MOD = 1e9 + 7;

let maxValue: number;
let sequenceLength: number;
let f: number[][]; // Memoization for dfs
let c: number[][]; // Combination table

function initializeSolution(n: number, mValue: number): void {
  maxValue = mValue;
  sequenceLength = n;
  f = Array.from({ length: maxValue + 1 }, () => Array(16).fill(-1));
  c = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(16).fill(0));

  for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j <= i && j < 16; ++j) {
      c[i][j] = j === 0 ? 1 : (c[i - 1][j] + c[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD;
    }
  }
}

function idealArrays(n: number, mValue: number): number {
  initializeSolution(n, mValue);

  let ans = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= maxValue; ++i) {
    ans = (ans + dfs(i, 1)) % MOD;
  }
  return ans;
}

function dfs(i: number, cnt: number): number {
  if (f[i][cnt] !== -1) return f[i][cnt];

  let res = c[sequenceLength - 1][cnt - 1];

  if (cnt < sequenceLength) {
    for (let k = 2; i * k <= maxValue; ++k) {
      res = (res + dfs(i * k, cnt + 1)) % MOD;
    }
  }

  f[i][cnt] = res;
  return res;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

**Input**: `n = 2, maxValue = 5`

- Possible arrays:
  - Starting with 1: [1,1], [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5]
  - Starting with 2: [2,2], [2,4]
  - Starting with 3: [3,3]
  - Starting with 4: [4,4]
  - Starting with 5: [5,5]

**Total**: 10  
**Output**: `10`

#### Example 2:

**Input**: `n = 5, maxValue = 3`

- Starting with 1: allows chains with 1, 2, or 3 → multiple combinations using combinations.
- Starting with 2: [2,2,2,2,2]
- Starting with 3: [3,3,3,3,3]

**Output**: `11`

### **Sumarry**

The problem leverages a combination of **combinatorics** and **memoized recursion** to efficiently count large numbers of valid sequences. It avoids brute-force construction of arrays by treating the sequence as a structure of multiplicative chains and then applying combinations to count their placement possibilities.
