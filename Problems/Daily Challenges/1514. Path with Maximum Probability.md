[1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-probability/)

# Intuition
The problem requires finding the path between two nodes in an undirected weighted graph that maximizes the probability of success. Each edge has an associated probability, and the probability of a path is the product of the probabilities of the edges on that path. This problem can be thought of as a variation of the shortest path problem but with probabilities instead of distances.

# Approach
The problem can be approached using a priority queue (or max-heap) to simulate Dijkstra's algorithm, where we aim to maximize the probability rather than minimize the distance. Here's how we can solve it:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the graph using an adjacency list, where each node points to a list of its neighbors along with the associated edge probabilities.

2. **Priority Queue**:
   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always explore the path with the highest current probability.
   - Start from the `start` node, initialize its probability to `1.0` (since starting at a node means the probability is 100% to be there), and push it to the heap.

3. **Exploration**:
   - Extract the node with the highest probability from the heap.
   - For each neighbor of this node, calculate the potential new probability if this path is taken.
   - If the new probability is greater than the currently known probability for that neighbor, update the probability and push the neighbor onto the heap.

4. **Termination**:
   - The process continues until the heap is empty or we reach the `end` node with the highest possible probability.
   - If the `end` node is never reached, return `0.0` as there's no valid path.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(E * log(V))***, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of nodes. This is because each edge can cause an insertion into the priority queue, and each insertion takes `O(log V)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(V + E)***, which is required to store the graph and the probability values.

# Code

```typescript
type Edge = [number, number, number];

function maxProbability(n: number, edges: Edge[], succProb: number[], start: number, end: number): number {
    const graph: Map<number, Array<[number, number]>> = new Map<number, Array<[number, number]>>();

    edges.forEach((edge, index) => {
        const [a, b] = edge;
        const prob: number = succProb[index];

        if (!graph.has(a)) graph.set(a, []);
        if (!graph.has(b)) graph.set(b, []);
        graph.get(a)!.push([b, prob]);
        graph.get(b)!.push([a, prob]);
    });

    const maxProb: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0.0);
    maxProb[start] = 1.0;

    const priorityQueue: [number, number][] = [[1.0, start]];

    while (priorityQueue.length > 0) {
        priorityQueue.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
        const [currentProb, node] = priorityQueue.shift()!;

        if (node === end) {
            return currentProb;
        }

        graph.get(node)?.forEach(([neighbor, edgeProb]) => {
            const newProb = currentProb * edgeProb;
            if (newProb > maxProb[neighbor]) {
                maxProb[neighbor] = newProb;
                priorityQueue.push([newProb, neighbor]);
            }
        });
    }

    return 0.0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: We first create an adjacency list representation of the graph, where each node points to its neighbors with their respective edge probabilities.

2. **Priority Queue Management**: The priority queue keeps track of nodes by their maximum current probability. The node with the highest probability is processed first.

3. **Probability Calculation**: For each node, we calculate the probability of reaching each of its neighbors via the current node. If this new probability is greater than any previously known probability for the neighbor, we update it and push the neighbor back into the priority queue.

4. **Final Output**: The function returns the highest probability of reaching the `end` node. If the node is not reachable, it returns `0.0`.
