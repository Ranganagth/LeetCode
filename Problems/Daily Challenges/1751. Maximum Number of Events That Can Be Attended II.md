[1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended-ii/)

### Problem Summary

You're given `events[i] = [start, end, value]` and a max number of events `k` you can attend.
You **can only attend one event at a time**, and **can't overlap events** (not even on end/start days).

Return the **maximum sum of values** by attending **at most `k` non-overlapping events**.

---

# Intuition

This is a variation of the **"Weighted Interval Scheduling"** problem with an additional **limit `k` on the number of events** you can attend.

The challenge is to:
1. Pick up to `k` events.
2. Ensure no overlapping between selected events.
3. Maximize the sum of selected event values.

# Approach: DP + Binary Search

#### Step 1: Sort the events by `endDay`

This helps when finding the previous non-overlapping event via binary search.

#### Step 2: Use **DP\[i]\[j]**:

* **i**: index of the current event (after sorting)
* **j**: number of events attended so far
* **DP\[i]\[j]** = max value by attending up to `j` events, considering first `i` events.

For each event `i`:

* We can skip it → `DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j]`
* Or take it →

  * Find last event `p` such that `events[p][1] < events[i][0]` (no overlap).
  * `DP[i][j] = max(DP[i][j], DP[p][j-1] + events[i][2])`

Use **binary search** to find `p`.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **O(N log N \* K)**:
  * `N` = number of events
  * For each `k` and each event, we may do a binary search over previous events → `log N`

# Code

```ts
function maxValue(events: number[][], k: number): number {
    // Sort events by end day
    events.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    const n = events.length;

    // Precompute the previous non-overlapping event for each event
    const prev: number[] = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let low = 0, high = i - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (events[mid][1] < events[i][0]) {
                prev[i] = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // DP table: dp[i][j] = max value using first i events and selecting j of them
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => new Array(k + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        const [start, end, value] = events[i - 1];
        for (let j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            // Case 1: Don't take event i
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j]);

            // Case 2: Take event i
            const p = prev[i - 1]; // index of last non-overlapping event
            dp[i][j] = Math.max(
                dp[i][j],
                dp[p + 1][j - 1] + value
            );
        }
    }

    return dp[n][k];
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]]`, `k = 2`

Sorted by end day → `[[1,2,4], [2,3,1], [3,4,3]]`

| Event | Can attend after | Value |
| ----- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 0     | -                | 4     |
| 1     | -                | 1     |
| 2     | 0 (ends at 2)    | 3     |

* Best choice: \[1,2,4] + \[3,4,3] = 7

---

### **Summary**

* This is a **classic interval DP problem** extended with a **maximum `k` selections** constraint.
* We use **sorting + binary search + DP** to find the optimal non-overlapping event combination.
* Efficient for up to `10^5` events due to `O(N log N * k)` complexity.
