[2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k/)

### **Problem**

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`, find the length of the **longest subsequence** of `s` that, when interpreted as a binary number, is **less than or equal to `k`**.

---

# Intuition

* A binary string's value increases **exponentially** with digits towards the right (because `2^i`).
* To stay under or equal to `k`, we should:

  * Try to include as **many zeroes** as possible (since they add no value).
  * Include only **those 1s** which keep the binary value within the bounds of `k`.

---

# Approach

1. Start from the **right end** of the string (least significant bit).
2. Keep a running total `val` of the binary number we're forming.
3. For each `s[i]`:

   * Always **count zeroes** — they don’t increase value.
   * For ones (`1`), include only if `val + 2^bitPosition <= k`.
4. Stop once adding more 1s would make `val > k`.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n), where n = `s.length`.
* **Space:** O(1), only uses a few variables.

---

# Code

```ts
function longestSubsequence(s: string, k: number): number {
    const n = s.length;
    let count = 0;
    let val = 0;
    let pow = 1;

    // Traverse from the end (least significant bits)
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            count++;  // always include zero
        } else {
            if (pow <= k && val + pow <= k) {
                val += pow;
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Update pow only if it won't overflow beyond k
        if (pow <= k) {
            pow *= 2;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

* `s = "1001010"`, `k = 5`
* Convert from right:

  * '0' → include → `count = 1`
  * '1' at 2^1 = 2 → include → `val = 2`, `count = 2`
  * '0' → include → `count = 3`
  * '0' → include → `count = 4`
  * '0' → include → `count = 5`
  * Next 1 would cause value to exceed `k = 5` → stop
* **Output: 5**

#### Example 2:

* `s = "00101001"`, `k = 1`
* Right to left:

  * Include all zeroes
  * Include only the last 1 (value = 1)
  * Skip earlier 1s
* **Output: 6**

---

### **Summary**

This greedy strategy leverages the binary representation and selects a maximal subsequence that doesn't violate the upper bound `k`. By processing from right to left and cautiously tracking value additions, we maximize the subsequence length while staying under the limit.
