[731. My Calendar II](https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-ii/)

# Intuition

The challenge now is to avoid **triple bookings**. A **triple booking** occurs when three events overlap at the same time. The key idea is to keep track of two things:
1. **Single bookings**: times where at least one event is booked.
2. **Double bookings**: times where two events overlap (but not three).

When we try to book a new event, we must check if it causes any part of the time to overlap with two existing bookings (i.e., causes a triple booking). If no triple booking occurs, we can safely add the event.

# Approach

1. **Track intervals**:
   - We maintain two lists:
     - `singleBooked`: intervals where there is at least one booking.
     - `doubleBooked`: intervals where there are already two overlapping bookings (i.e., double bookings).
  
2. **Check for triple bookings**:
   - Before adding a new event [start, end), we check if it overlaps with any intervals in `doubleBooked`. If it does, this would result in a triple booking, so we return `false` and don't add the event.
   
3. **Update the bookings**:
   - If the new event doesn't cause a triple booking, we update both the `singleBooked` and `doubleBooked` lists accordingly. We add any overlaps between the new event and existing `singleBooked` intervals to the `doubleBooked` list, and we add the new event to the `singleBooked` list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Each `book` operation checks for overlaps and can potentially compare against all previous bookings, making the time complexity ***O(n^2)***, where *n* is the number of bookings made so far.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - We are storing the intervals in two lists, leading to a space complexity of ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of bookings.

# Code:

```typescript
class MyCalendarTwo {
    private singleBooked: [number, number][];
    private doubleBooked: [number, number][];

    constructor() {
        this.singleBooked = [];
        this.doubleBooked = [];
    }

    book(start: number, end: number): boolean {
        for (const [doubleStart, doubleEnd] of this.doubleBooked) {
            if (start < doubleEnd && doubleStart < end) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        for (const [singleStart, singleEnd] of this.singleBooked) {
            const overlapStart = Math.max(singleStart, start);
            const overlapEnd = Math.min(singleEnd, end);
            if (overlapStart < overlapEnd) {
                this.doubleBooked.push([overlapStart, overlapEnd]);
            }
        }

        this.singleBooked.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Class Initialization**:
   - The `MyCalendarTwo` class initializes two lists: `singleBooked` to store all the single bookings and `doubleBooked` to store intervals where two bookings overlap.

2. **Book Method**:
   - The `book` method takes `start` and `end` parameters, representing the new event.
   - First, it checks whether the new event overlaps with any intervals in `doubleBooked` using the condition `start < doubleEnd && doubleStart < end`. If an overlap is found, it would cause a triple booking, so we return `false`.
   - If no triple booking occurs, we proceed to check for overlaps between the new event and the intervals in `singleBooked`. Any overlap between the new event and an existing single booking is added to `doubleBooked`.
   - Finally, the new event is added to `singleBooked`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: ["MyCalendarTwo", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
       [[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
```

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We call `MyCalendarTwo()`. This initializes an instance of the class with empty `singleBooked` and `doubleBooked` lists.

2. **First Booking**: 
   - Call `book(10, 20)`.
   - No double bookings yet, so this event is added directly to `singleBooked`.
   - `singleBooked = [[10, 20]]`
   - Output: `true`.

3. **Second Booking**: 
   - Call `book(50, 60)`.
   - No overlap with the existing booking *[10, 20)*, so the event is added to `singleBooked`.
   - `singleBooked = [[10, 20], [50, 60]]`
   - Output: `true`.

4. **Third Booking**: 
   - Call `book(10, 40)`.
   - It overlaps with the first booking *[10, 20)*, so the overlapping portion *[10, 20)* is added to `doubleBooked`.
   - No triple booking occurs, so the event is added to `singleBooked`.
   - `singleBooked = [[10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40]]`
   - `doubleBooked = [[10, 20]]`
   - Output: `true`.

5. **Fourth Booking**: 
   - Call `book(5, 15)`.
   - It overlaps with the `doubleBooked` interval *[10, 20)*, specifically the *[10, 15)* portion.
   - This would result in a triple booking, so we return `false`.
   - Output: `false`.

6. **Fifth Booking**: 
   - Call `book(5, 10)`.
   - No triple bookings will occur, as the new event ends before the double-booked interval starting at 10.
   - The event is added to `singleBooked`.
   - `singleBooked = [[10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 10]]`
   - Output: `true`.

7. **Sixth Booking**: 
   - Call `book(25, 55)`.
   - This event overlaps with the third booking *[10, 40)* and the second booking *[50, 60)*.
   - The overlap between *[25, 40)* and *[25, 55)* is added to `doubleBooked`, but no triple bookings occur.
   - The event is added to `singleBooked`.
   - `singleBooked = [[10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 10], [25, 55]]`
   - `doubleBooked = [[10, 20], [25, 40]]`
   - Output: `true`.

### Final Output:
The resulting output is: `[null, true, true, true, false, true, true]`.

This approach effectively handles up to 1000 bookings without causing triple bookings.
