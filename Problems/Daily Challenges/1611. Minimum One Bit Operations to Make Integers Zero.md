[1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-one-bit-operations-to-make-integers-zero/)

# Intuition

This problem is equivalent to finding the number of steps needed to reach `0` from `n` using **Gray code transformations**.

Key insight:

* Each operation changes bits in a pattern similar to transitions between consecutive Gray codes.
* The number of operations needed to transform `n` into `0` equals the position of `n` in the **Gray code sequence** (where Gray code is derived from binary numbers).

**Gray Code Property**:

* Binary number `x` → Gray code `x ⊕ (x >> 1)`
* To find the step number (reverse Gray code), we repeatedly XOR `n` with right-shifted versions of itself until it becomes zero.

Thus, the minimum number of operations = **binary to gray decoding of `n`**.

---

# Approach

1. We want to find the *index* of `n` in the Gray code sequence.
2. To decode a Gray code back to binary:

   * Let `result = n`
   * While shifting `n` right repeatedly, XOR with the shifted value to accumulate the original binary number.
3. The decoded binary number gives the number of steps (operations).

This decoding effectively counts the minimal transformations required.

# Time Complexity

* Each iteration shifts `n` right until it becomes `0` → `O(log n)` time.
* Constant space.

# Code

```typescript
function minimumOneBitOperations(n: number): number {
    let res = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        res ^= n;
        n >>= 1;
    }
    return res;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

```
n = 3
Binary: 11
```

Steps:

* res = 0, n = 3
  → res ^= 3 → res = 3
  → n >>= 1 → n = 1
* res ^= 1 → res = 2
  → n >>= 1 → n = 0

Output = 2
Matches the example (`"11" -> "01" -> "00"`).


#### Example 2:

```
n = 6
Binary: 110
```

Steps:

* res = 0, n = 6
  → res ^= 6 → res = 6
  → n >>= 1 → n = 3
* res ^= 3 → res = 5
  → n >>= 1 → n = 1
* res ^= 1 → res = 4
  → n >>= 1 → n = 0

Output = 4
Matches the example.
