[179. Largest Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to arrange a list of non-negative integers to form the largest possible number when concatenated. The key insight is to determine the order of numbers based on their concatenation results rather than their individual values.

# Approach

1. **Convert all integers to strings**: This allows us to easily concatenate and compare the combined results.
2. **Sort the array**: We need to define a custom comparator for the sort function such that for any two numbers `x` and `y`, they should be ordered as `x` before `y` if the concatenated string `x+y` is greater than `y+x`.
3. **Concatenate the sorted numbers**: After sorting, concatenate all numbers to form the final result.
4. **Handle edge cases**: If the largest number is `0`, the result should be `"0"` (e.g., for input `[0, 0]`).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, where `n` is the number of elements in the list. This is due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of elements in the list. This is for storing the string representations of the numbers and the sorted array.

# Code
```typescript
function largestNumber(nums: number[]): string {
    if (nums.length === 0) return "";
    
    const strNums = nums.map(num => num.toString());
    strNums.sort((a, b) => (b + a).localeCompare(a + b));
    const result = strNums.join('');
    
    return result[0] === '0' ? '0' : result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Conversion to Strings**:
   - We start by converting all numbers to strings to facilitate easy concatenation and comparison.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - The custom comparator in the `sort` method uses string concatenation to compare which combination results in a larger number.
   - For two strings `a` and `b`, we compare `b + a` with `a + b`. If `b + a` is greater, `b` should come before `a`.

3. **Concatenation**:
   - After sorting, we concatenate the sorted string numbers.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the first character of the result is `0`, it means all numbers were zeros, and thus the result should be `"0"`.
