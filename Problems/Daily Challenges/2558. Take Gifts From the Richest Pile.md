[2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile](https://leetcode.com/problems/take-gifts-from-the-richest-pile/)
# Intuition:

The problem revolves around repeatedly reducing the largest pile of gifts, leaving behind a fraction of the original pile (the floor of its square root). The task is to compute the sum of all gifts remaining after performing this operation `k` times.

Using a **max-heap** data structure allows us to efficiently keep track of the largest pile and quickly reduce it in every step. A max-heap ensures the largest element is always accessible in ***O(1)***, and adding or removing elements is ***O(log n)***.

# Approach:

1. **Max-Heap Construction**:
    - Convert the input array `gifts` into a max-heap. In many programming languages, including TypeScript, heaps are implemented as min-heaps, so we simulate a max-heap by pushing the negative of each number.
2. **Perform K Operations**:
    - For `k` iterations, pop the largest pile from the heap, calculate the floor of its square root, and push the reduced value back into the heap.
3. **Sum Up Remaining Gifts**:
    - After performing all operations, sum up the absolute values of the numbers remaining in the heap.
4. **Edge Cases**:
    - If all piles have a single gift, the sum remains unchanged since the square root of 1 is 1.
    - If kk is large but piles quickly diminish to minimal values, the result will depend on the original distribution.

# Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Constructing the heap: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the size of `gifts`.
    - Performing *k* operations: ***O(k log n)*** for extracting and re-adding elements to the heap.
    - Total: ***O(n + k log n)***.
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - The heap requires ***O(n)*** space.

# Code:

```typescript
function remainingGifts(gifts: number[], k: number): number {
    // Create a max-heap by storing negative values (since JS supports min-heaps by default)
    const maxHeap: number[] = gifts.map(gift => -gift);
    // Heapify: sort the array into heap order
    maxHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Simulates max-heap

    // Perform K operations
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        // Extract the largest element (smallest negative number)
        const maxGift = -maxHeap.shift()!;
        // Calculate the new number of gifts left behind
        const reducedGift = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(maxGift));
        // Add the reduced value back to the heap
        maxHeap.push(-reducedGift);
        // Re-heapify to maintain heap order
        maxHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    // Sum up the remaining gifts
    return maxHeap.reduce((sum, gift) => sum - gift, 0); // Convert negatives back to positives
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**:

#### **Example 1**:

**Input**:

```typescript
gifts = [25,64,9,4,100];
k = 4;
```

**Execution**:

1. Convert gifts to max-heap: `[-100, -64, -9, -4, -25]`.
2. Iteration 1:
    - Extract `100`, calculate floor(100)=10(√100) = 10, insert back.
    - Heap: `[-64, -25, -9, -4, -10]`.
3. Iteration 2:
    - Extract `64`, calculate floor(64)=8(√64) = 8, insert back.
    - Heap: `[-25, -10, -9, -4, -8]`.
4. Iteration 3:
    - Extract `25`, calculate floor(25)=5(√25) = 5, insert back.
    - Heap: `[-10, -8, -9, -4, -5]`.
5. Iteration 4:
    - Extract `10`, calculate floor(10)=3(√10) = 3, insert back.
    - Heap: `[-9, -8, -5, -4, -3]`.
6. Remaining gifts: 9+8+5+4+3=29.

**Output**:

```typescript
29
```

#### **Example 2**:

**Input**:

```typescript
gifts = [1,1,1,1];
k = 4;
```

**Execution**:

1. Convert gifts to max-heap: `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`.
2. kk iterations:
    - Each time, extract `1`, calculate floor(1)=1(√1) = 1, insert back.
    - Heap remains unchanged.
3. Remaining gifts: 1+1+1+1=4.

**Output**:

```typescript
4
```

### **Key Insights**:

- The max-heap ensures efficient access to the largest pile for reduction in every operation.
- Using the floor of the square root guarantees that pile sizes monotonically decrease, leading to convergence.
- The difference in results depends on the initial distribution of piles and the number of operations kk.
