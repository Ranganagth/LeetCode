[1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-with-x-elements-greater-than-or-equal-x/)

# Intuition
To determine if an array `nums` is special, we need to find a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`. 

# Approach
1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array in non-decreasing order. This helps in easily counting how many numbers are greater than or equal to a given number.
2. **Iterate Through Possible Values of x**: Iterate through each possible value of `x` from 1 to the length of the array `nums`.
3. **Check the Condition**: For each possible value of `x`, check if there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`. This can be done efficiently by utilizing the sorted property of the array.
4. **Return the Result**: If such an `x` is found, return it. Otherwise, return `-1`.

# Explanation
1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting helps in making the counting of elements that are greater than or equal to `x` more efficient.
2. **Counting Elements**: For each possible value of `x`, count how many elements in the sorted array are greater than or equal to `x`. This is done by checking the elements from the end of the sorted array.
3. **Condition Check**: If exactly `x` elements are found to be greater than or equal to `x`, return `x`. If no such `x` exists, return `-1`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step, where `n` is the length of the array. The subsequent iteration and counting steps are ***O(n)***.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(1)*** if we do not consider the space used by the sorting algorithm, which is typically ***O(log n)*** due to recursion or stack space used by the sorting algorithm.

# Code
```typescript
function specialArray(nums: number[]): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = nums.length;

    for (let x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0 && nums[i] >= x; i--) {
            count++;
        }
        if (count === x) {
            return x;
        }
    }

    return -1;
};

```
