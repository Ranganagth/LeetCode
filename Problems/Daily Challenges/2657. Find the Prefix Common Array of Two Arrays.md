[2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays/)

# Intuition

The problem requires calculating how many numbers are common between two permutations, *A* and *B*, up to each index *i*. These common elements should have already appeared in both arrays at or before index *i*.

To solve this efficiently:
1. **Tracking Seen Elements**: Maintain sets to track numbers seen in *A* and *B* as we iterate through the arrays.
2. **Commonality Check**: At each index *i*, calculate the intersection of the numbers seen so far in *A* and *B*.
3. **Store Results**: Count the size of this intersection to get *C[i]*.

Given the small constraint (*n ≤ 50*), a direct simulation with sets is optimal.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create two sets to track the elements seen so far in *A* and *B*.
    - Initialize the prefix common array *C* with zeros.
	
2. **Iterate Through Arrays**:
    - At each index *i*:
        - Add A[i] to the set of elements seen in *A*.
        - Add B[i] to the set of elements seen in *B*.
        - Compute the intersection of the two sets to determine how many elements are common.
        - Store the size of the intersection in *C[i]*.
		
3. **Output *C***:
    - Return the prefix common array.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Each intersection operation costs *O(n)*, and we do it *n* times. Thus, ***O(n^2)***.
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Two sets are maintained, each with a maximum size of *n*. Thus, ***O(n)***.

Given *n ≤ 50*, this is efficient.

# Code

```typescript
function findThePrefixCommonArray(A: number[], B: number[]): number[] {
    const n = A.length;
    const seenA = new Set<number>();
    const seenB = new Set<number>();
    const prefixCommonArray: number[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        seenA.add(A[i]);
        seenB.add(B[i]);

        // Compute the intersection of seenA and seenB
        let commonCount = 0;
        for (const num of seenA) {
            if (seenB.has(num)) {
                commonCount++;
            }
        }

        prefixCommonArray.push(commonCount);
    }

    return prefixCommonArray;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const A = [1, 3, 2, 4];
const B = [3, 1, 2, 4];
console.log(findThePrefixCommonArray(A, B)); // Output: [0, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Initialize seenA = {}, seenB = {},C = [].
2. Iteration:
    - i = 0:
        - seenA = {1}, seenB = {3}.
        - Common = {}\{\}, C[0]=0C[0] = 0.
    - i = 1:
        - seenA = {1, 3}, seenB = {1, 3}.
        - Common = {1, 3}, C[1] = 2.
    - i = 2:
        - seenA = {1, 3, 2}, seenB = {1, 3, 2}.
        - Common = {1, 3, 2}, C[2] = 3.
    - i = 3:
        - seenA = {1, 3, 2, 4}, seenB = {1, 3, 2, 4}.
        - Common = {1, 3, 2, 4}, C[3] = 4.

**Output**: [0,2,3,4][0, 2, 3, 4].

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const A = [2, 3, 1];
const B = [3, 1, 2];
console.log(findThePrefixCommonArray(A, B)); // Output: [0, 1, 3]
```

**Walkthrough**:
1. Initialize seenA = {}, seenB = {}, {C} = [].
2. Iteration:
    - i = 0:
        - seenA = {2}, seenB = {3}.
        - Common = {}, C[0] = 0.
    - i = 1:
        - seenA = {2, 3}, seenB = {3, 1}.
        - Common = *{3}*, C[1] = 1.
    - i = 2:
        - seenA = {2, 3, 1}, seenB = {3, 1, 2}.
        - Common = {1,2,3}\{1, 2, 3\}, C[2]=3C[2] = 3.

**Output**: [0,1,3][0, 1, 3].

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Minimal Input**:
    - A = [1], B = [1].
    - Output: [1][1].
	
2. **No Common Elements Initially**:
    - A = [1, 2, 3], B = [4, 5, 6].
    - Output: [0,0,0][0, 0, 0].
	
3. **Fully Overlapping Permutations**:
    - A = [1, 2, 3], B = [1, 2, 3].
    - Output: [1,2,3][1, 2, 3].
