[861. Score After Flipping Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-after-flipping-matrix/)

# Intuition
To maximize the score, we want to ensure that the most significant bit (leftmost bit) of each binary number is set to 1. We can achieve this by flipping rows or columns to ensure that the first element of each row is 1. After doing this, we can flip the columns if necessary to maximize the score.

# Approach
1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the current score.
2. Traverse through each column. If the count of 0s in the column is greater than the count of 1s, flip the column.
3. After ensuring that the most significant bit of each binary number is set to 1, traverse through each row. If the first element of the row is 0, flip the row.
4. Calculate the score after flipping rows and columns.
5. Return the calculated score.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(m Ã— n)***, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
function matrixScore(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (grid[i][0] === 0) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                grid[i][j] ^= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        let countOnes = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                countOnes++;
            }
        }
        if (countOnes < m - countOnes) {
            for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                grid[i][j] ^= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                result += Math.pow(2, n - j - 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
