1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

# Intuition:

The key insight is that the parity (even or odd) of the number of vowels can be tracked using a bitmask. Each vowel can be represented by a bit in a 5-bit integer. This approach allows us to efficiently determine when a substring contains an even number of all vowels.

### Key Observations:

1. **Vowel Representation**:
   - We use a 5-bit integer to represent the number of occurrences (parity) of vowels in the current substring. Each bit corresponds to one vowel:
     - 'a' -> 1st bit (00001)
     - 'e' -> 2nd bit (00010)
     - 'i' -> 3rd bit (00100)
     - 'o' -> 4th bit (01000)
     - 'u' -> 5th bit (10000)
2. **Bitmask for Parity**:
   - At any given point in the string, the current "state" of vowel parities is represented by the bitmask, where each bit tells whether the number of a particular vowel is even (bit=0) or odd (bit=1).
3. **State Matching**:
   - If the current bitmask is the same as a previously seen bitmask, it means that the substring between these two indices contains an even number of each vowel, because the bitmask hasn't changed.

# Approach:

1. **Initialize a bitmask `state = 0`** to track the parity of vowels (all even at the start).
2. **Use a hash map `stateToIndex`** to store the first occurrence of each state. This allows us to calculate the longest substring where the vowels have even counts.
3. **Traverse the string**:
   - For each character, update the bitmask if the character is a vowel.
   - If the current state has been seen before, calculate the length of the substring from the first occurrence of that state to the current index.
   - Update the hash map if the current state is encountered for the first time.
4. **Track the maximum length** of all valid substrings where vowels have even counts.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: _O(n)_, where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once and perform **_O(1)_** operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: **_O(1)_**, because the bitmask has only 32 possible states (since we are using 5 bits for 5 vowels).

# Code:

```typescript
function findTheLongestSubstring(s: string): number {
  const vowels = { a: 0, e: 1, i: 2, o: 3, u: 4 };
  let state = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;
  const stateToIndex = new Map<number, number>();
  stateToIndex.set(0, -1);

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    const char = s[i];
    if (char in vowels) {
      state ^= 1 << vowels[char];
    }

    if (stateToIndex.has(state)) {
      maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - stateToIndex.get(state)!);
    } else {
      stateToIndex.set(state, i);
    }
  }

  return maxLength;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Vowel Representation**:

   - We create a map `vowels` to assign each vowel a bit position.
   - The bitmask `state` represents whether each vowel has been seen an even or odd number of times. For example:
     - `state = 00000` means all vowels have been seen an even number of times.
     - `state = 00011` means 'a' and 'e' have been seen an odd number of times, while the other vowels have been seen an even number of times.

2. **State Transitions**:

   - As we traverse the string, we update the bitmask `state` when we encounter a vowel. This is done using XOR (`^`), which toggles the corresponding bit in the bitmask.

3. **State Tracking**:

   - The first time we see a particular state, we record its index in the map `stateToIndex`.
   - If we encounter the same state later, the substring between the two indices has an even number of all vowels, because the bitmask hasnâ€™t changed.

4. **Max Length**:
   - For every state that we've seen before, we calculate the length of the substring and update `maxLength` if it's the longest so far.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

Input: `s = "eleetminicoworoep"`

- Initial state: `00000`
- At index 0: 'e' -> toggle 2nd bit -> `00010`
- At index 1: 'l' -> no change
- At index 2: 'e' -> toggle 2nd bit again -> `00000` (seen before at -1)
- Substring from -1 to 2 is valid (length 3)
- Continue updating bitmask for each vowel and check for the longest valid substring.
- Final answer: `13`, corresponding to the substring `"leetminicowor"`.

#### Example 2:

Input: `s = "leetcodeisgreat"`

- Initial state: `00000`
- At index 0: 'l' -> no change
- At index 1: 'e' -> toggle 2nd bit -> `00010`
- At index 2: 'e' -> toggle 2nd bit again -> `00000`
- Substring from -1 to 2 is valid (length 3)
- Longest valid substring is `"leetc"` with length 5.

#### Example 3:

Input: `s = "bcbcbc"`

- No vowels are present, so the entire string is valid. The result is `6`.

### Conclusion:

This approach efficiently tracks vowel parity using a bitmask and a hash map to find the longest substring where all vowels appear an even number of times. The time complexity is O(n), which makes it well-suited for large inputs, up to the constraint of 500,000 characters.
