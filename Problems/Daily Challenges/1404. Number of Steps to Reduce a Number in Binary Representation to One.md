[1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of reducing the binary representation of an integer to 1 by following the given rules. By examining the binary string, we can determine whether the current number is odd or even and apply the appropriate operation. This approach avoids converting the entire binary string to a decimal number, which can be inefficient for large inputs.

# Approach
1. Start from the rightmost bit of the binary string (least significant bit).
2. Initialize a step counter to keep track of the number of operations performed.
3. Iterate through the binary string from right to left:
   - If the current bit is `1` and it is not the last bit, add 1 to the current number (set the current bit to `0` and handle the carry to the next bit).
   - If the current bit is `0`, divide the current number by 2 (simply move to the next bit).
4. Continue the process until we reach the leftmost bit.
5. Return the step counter.

# Explanation
- When the current bit is `1` and it is not the last bit, adding 1 will change it to `0` and may cause a carry to the next bit, which is handled by iterating further.
- When the current bit is `0`, dividing by 2 is equivalent to moving to the next bit.
- This process simulates the division and addition operations directly on the binary string without converting it to a decimal number.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the binary string `s`. Each bit is processed at most once.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```TypeScript
function numSteps(s: string): number {
    let steps = 0;
    let carry = 0;

    for (let i = s.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            if (carry === 1) {
                steps++;
            } else {
                carry = 1;
                steps += 2;
            }
        } else {
            if (carry === 1) {
                steps += 2;
            } else {
                steps++;
            }
        }
    }

    if (carry === 1) {
        steps++;
    }

    return steps;
};
