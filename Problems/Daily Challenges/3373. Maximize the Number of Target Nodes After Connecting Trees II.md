[3373. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-number-of-target-nodes-after-connecting-trees-ii/)

# Intuition

In this problem, a node `u` is considered *target* to another node `v` **if the distance between them (number of edges) is even**.

The key observation is that in a **tree**, any two nodes have exactly one unique path between them. Thus, we can **partition the tree into two sets based on distance parity**:
* Nodes at **even** distance from a root
* Nodes at **odd** distance from the root

Connecting nodes across two such trees shifts the parity of distances, depending on where the new edge connects. Since the distance of a node from another changes parity if we traverse through an edge, our solution hinges on:
* Knowing the count of nodes at even/odd depths in both trees
* Maximizing the sum of such counts after considering parity flips

# Approach

1. **Preprocess Tree1 and Tree2**:
   * For both trees, do a **DFS traversal** to compute how many nodes are at **even** and **odd** depth levels.
     * This gives: `even1`, `odd1`, `even2`, `odd2`

2. **Compute Target Nodes for Each Node in Tree1**:
   * For each node `i` in Tree1:
     * Let `i` be at depth `d`. The parity of `d` determines:
       * If connected to an **even-depth** node in Tree2: parity remains the same.
       * If connected to an **odd-depth** node in Tree2: parity flips.
     * So:
       * If `d` is even:
         * Connect to even node in Tree2 → reachable nodes = `even1 + even2`
         * Connect to odd node in Tree2 → reachable nodes = `even1 + odd2`
       * If `d` is odd:
         * Connect to even node in Tree2 → reachable nodes = `odd1 + even2`
         * Connect to odd node in Tree2 → reachable nodes = `odd1 + odd2`
     * Pick the **maximum** of the two.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity**:
  * `O(n + m)`: We traverse each tree once using DFS to compute depth parities.
  * `O(n)`: To compute the final answer array based on depth parity.
  
* **Space Complexity**:
  * `O(n + m)` for adjacency lists and depth arrays.

# Code

```ts
function maxTargetNodes(edges1: number[][], edges2: number[][]): number[] {
    const buildGraph = (edges: number[][], size: number): Map<number, number[]> => {
        const graph = new Map<number, number[]>();
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) graph.set(i, []);
        for (const [u, v] of edges) {
            graph.get(u)!.push(v);
            graph.get(v)!.push(u);
        }
        return graph;
    };

    const computeDepths = (graph: Map<number, number[]>, size: number): { depth: number[], even: number, odd: number } => {
        const depth: number[] = Array(size).fill(-1);
        const dfs = (node: number, d: number, parent: number) => {
            depth[node] = d;
            for (const neighbor of graph.get(node) || []) {
                if (neighbor !== parent) {
                    dfs(neighbor, d + 1, node);
                }
            }
        };
        dfs(0, 0, -1);
        let even = 0, odd = 0;
        for (const d of depth) {
            if (d % 2 === 0) even++;
            else odd++;
        }
        return { depth, even, odd };
    };

    const n = edges1.length + 1;
    const m = edges2.length + 1;

    const graph1 = buildGraph(edges1, n);
    const graph2 = buildGraph(edges2, m);

    const { depth: depth1, even: even1, odd: odd1 } = computeDepths(graph1, n);
    const { even: even2, odd: odd2 } = computeDepths(graph2, m);

    const answer: number[] = Array(n);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (depth1[i] % 2 === 0) {
            answer[i] = Math.max(even1 + even2, even1 + odd2);
        } else {
            answer[i] = Math.max(odd1 + even2, odd1 + odd2);
        }
    }
    return answer;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### Input:

```ts
edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]]
edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]]
```

* Tree1 nodes: 0–4
* Tree2 nodes: 0–7
* Distance (depth) parity is precomputed for both trees.

#### Depth Classification:

* `depth1 = [0,1,1,2,2]` → even1 = 3 (nodes 0,3,4), odd1 = 2 (nodes 1,2)
* Assume `even2 = 4`, `odd2 = 4` (depending on structure)

Now for each node `i` in Tree1:

* For node 0 (even):

  * Max nodes = max(3+4, 3+4) = 7
* For node 1 (odd):

  * Max nodes = max(2+4, 2+4) = 6
    ... and so on.

#### Output:

```ts
[8, 7, 7, 8, 8]
```

(Actual values depend on depth distributions in Tree2.)

### **Summary**

This problem efficiently reduces to a **depth parity classification**. Since distances determine the parity, and parity determines whether a node is a "target", we avoid expensive BFS or DFS per query by precomputing even/odd distributions. This is a powerful example of how properties of **trees** and **parity** can be leveraged for optimal solutions.
