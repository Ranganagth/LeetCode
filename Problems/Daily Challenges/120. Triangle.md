[120. Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/triangle/)

# Intuition

* At each step, you can move **down** or **down-right** to the next row.
* To minimize the path sum, at every number you should pick the smaller of the two choices from the row below.
* This naturally suggests a **Dynamic Programming** approach.

Instead of starting from the top and exploring all paths (which would be exponential), we start from the **bottom row** and work our way upward:

* At each element in row `i`, update it as:

  ```
  triangle[i][j] = triangle[i][j] + min(triangle[i+1][j], triangle[i+1][j+1])
  ```
* This way, each cell represents the **minimum path sum starting from that cell down to the bottom**.
* The top element `triangle[0][0]` will eventually contain the result.

---

# Approach

1. Start from the **second-to-last row** (`n-2`) and move upward.
2. For each element at `(i, j)`, update it by adding the **minimum of its two children** in the next row.
3. Continue until the top.
4. Return `triangle[0][0]`.

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n^2)` where `n` is number of rows (each row has at most `n` elements).

* **Space:**
  * If modifying the input: `O(1)` extra space.
  * If preserving the input: `O(n)` for a DP array.

# Code

```typescript
function minimumTotal(triangle: number[][]): number {
    const n = triangle.length;

    // Start from the second last row and go upwards
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            triangle[i][j] += Math.min(triangle[i + 1][j], triangle[i + 1][j + 1]);
        }
    }

    return triangle[0][0];
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

Input:

```
triangle = [[2],
            [3,4],
            [6,5,7],
            [4,1,8,3]]
```

* Start from row `2`:

  ```
  [6,5,7]
  ↓
  [6+min(4,1), 5+min(1,8), 7+min(8,3)]
  = [7, 6, 10]
  ```

  Triangle now:

  ```
  [2]
  [3,4]
  [7,6,10]
  [4,1,8,3]
  ```

* Next row `1`:

  ```
  [3,4]
  ↓
  [3+min(7,6), 4+min(6,10)]
  = [9, 10]
  ```

  Triangle now:

  ```
  [2]
  [9,10]
  [7,6,10]
  [4,1,8,3]
  ```

* Next row `0`:

  ```
  [2]
  ↓
  [2+min(9,10)] = [11]
  ```

Final answer = **11**.
