[2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-good-subarrays/)

# Intuition

We are asked to count subarrays where **at least `k` pairs of equal elements** exist. A pair is counted when `arr[i] == arr[j]` and `i < j`.

Instead of checking all possible subarrays (which is too slow for large input), we use a **sliding window** approach. We count, for each window, how many such pairs exist using a **frequency map**, and then count how many windows end at `right` and are good (i.e., have at least `k` such pairs).

# Approach

1. Use a **sliding window** with two pointers `left` and `right`.
2. Maintain a **map** (or object) `count` to store the frequency of elements in the window.
3. Keep track of the **number of equal pairs** in the current window. For each `nums[right]`:
   - Before inserting, if `count[x] = c`, then inserting one more creates `c` additional pairs (since `x` already exists `c` times).
4. Shrink the window from the left until the number of pairs is **less than k**.
5. For each position `right`, the number of **good subarrays ending at `right`** is equal to the number of possible starting indices `left`, i.e., `(left)` windows ending at `right` are good.
6. Sum all such good subarrays.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - Each element is added/removed from the window at most once.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`  
  - In worst case, we might store frequencies for all elements.

# Code

```ts
function countGood(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let count = new Map<number, number>();
    let pairCount = 0;
    let result = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        const val = nums[right];
        const current = count.get(val) ?? 0;

        // Adding current element to window
        pairCount += current;
        count.set(val, current + 1);

        // Shrink window from left if pairs >= k
        while (pairCount >= k) {
            // All subarrays from left to right are valid
            result += nums.length - right;

            // Remove from left
            const leftVal = nums[left];
            const leftCount = count.get(leftVal)!;
            pairCount -= leftCount - 1; // Removing one reduces pair count
            count.set(leftVal, leftCount - 1);
            left++;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input**:  
```ts
nums = [3,1,4,3,2,2,4], k = 2
```

**Valid good subarrays (with at least 2 equal pairs)**:

- [3,1,4,3,2,2] → pairs: (3,3), (2,2)
- [3,1,4,3,2,2,4] → pairs: (3,3), (2,2), (4,4)
- [1,4,3,2,2,4] → pairs: (2,2), (4,4)
- [4,3,2,2,4] → pairs: (2,2), (4,4)

Total = `4`

**Output**: `4`

### **Summary**

This problem is a perfect use-case for the **sliding window** technique with real-time frequency counting. Instead of generating all subarrays, we maintain window validity efficiently by tracking frequency-based pair counts. This keeps the solution scalable for large arrays.
