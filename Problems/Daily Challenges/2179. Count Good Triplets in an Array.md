[2179. Count Good Triplets in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets-in-an-array/)

# Intuition

We are given two permutations of integers `[0, 1, ..., n-1]`. The goal is to count how many triplets `(x, y, z)` exist such that:
- The elements are in increasing order **in terms of index** in **both** arrays.    

This is similar to finding common subsequences of length 3 with increasing index order. The idea is to **map the positions of one array** and **analyze the order** based on that.

# Approach

1. **Map positions of `nums2`**:  
    Create a `position` map such that `position[v] = index of v in nums2`.
    
2. **Transform `nums1` to `mapped`**:  
    Replace each element `v` in `nums1` with `position[v]`. This gives us a sequence where a "good triplet" corresponds to an increasing triplet in the `mapped` array.
    
3. **Use Fenwick Tree (BIT)**:
    - We want to count, for each middle element `y`, how many elements before `y` are smaller (count of `x` such that `x < y` in both arrays).      
    - And how many elements after `y` are larger (count of `z` such that `y < z` in both arrays).
    
4. **Two Fenwick Trees**:
    - `leftTree`: Counts how many elements before the current index have value less than current.    
    - `rightTree`: Initialized with all 1s. As we iterate, we subtract 1 when we reach an index so that the tree reflects remaining elements after current.
    
5. **For each position `i`**:
    - Query `leftTree` for count of elements less than `mapped[i]` seen so far.        
    - Query `rightTree` for count of elements greater than `mapped[i]` to the right.
    - Multiply the two counts to get number of good triplets with `mapped[i]` as the middle element.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`
    - Each Fenwick Tree operation (update/query) takes `O(log n)`.    
    - We perform `O(n)` operations for prefix and suffix scans.
    
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`
    - For mapping, Fenwick Trees, and transformed arrays
	
# Code

```ts
class FenwickTree {
    tree: number[];
    size: number;

    constructor(n: number) {
        this.size = n;
        this.tree = Array(n + 2).fill(0);
    }

    update(i: number, delta: number) {
        i += 1;
        while (i < this.tree.length) {
            this.tree[i] += delta;
            i += i & -i;
        }
    }

    query(i: number): number {
        i += 1;
        let sum = 0;
        while (i > 0) {
            sum += this.tree[i];
            i -= i & -i;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    queryRange(l: number, r: number): number {
        return this.query(r) - this.query(l - 1);
    }
}

function goodTriplets(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {
    const n = nums1.length;
    const pos = Array(n);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        pos[nums2[i]] = i;
    }

    const mapped = nums1.map(v => pos[v]);

    const leftTree = new FenwickTree(n);
    const rightTree = new FenwickTree(n);

    // Initialize rightTree with all counts = 1
    for (let v of mapped) {
        rightTree.update(v, 1);
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const mid = mapped[i];
        rightTree.update(mid, -1); // remove current from rightTree
        const leftCount = leftTree.query(mid - 1);
        const rightCount = rightTree.queryRange(mid + 1, n - 1);
        result += leftCount * rightCount;
        leftTree.update(mid, 1);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Example Input**:

```ts
nums1 = [4,0,1,3,2]
nums2 = [4,1,0,2,3]
```

**Step-by-step**:

1. `position` of elements in `nums2`:
    ```
    4 → 0, 1 → 1, 0 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4
    ```
    
2. `mapped = nums1.map(v => position[v])`:
    ```
    mapped = [0, 2, 1, 4, 3]
    ```
    
3. As we iterate each index, for each `mapped[i]` as middle:
    - Count elements left of it that are smaller (`leftCount`)        
    - Count elements right of it that are greater (`rightCount`)        
    - Multiply and accumulate into result   
	
4. Final result = `4`

### **Summary**

Using coordinate transformation and Fenwick Trees, we efficiently count increasing triplets that maintain relative order in both permutations. This is a classic use of indexed trees for counting range-based orderings in sublinear time per operation.
