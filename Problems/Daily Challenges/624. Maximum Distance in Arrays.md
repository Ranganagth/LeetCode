[624. Maximum Distance in Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-distance-in-arrays/)

# Intuition:
Given multiple sorted arrays, the goal is to find the maximum distance between two integers picked from two different arrays. The "distance" is defined as the absolute difference between these two integers. Since each array is sorted in ascending order, the largest number in any array is the last element, and the smallest number is the first element. Therefore, to maximize the distance, you want to either:
1. Subtract the smallest element of one array from the largest element of another array.
2. Track the overall smallest and largest elements as you iterate through the arrays.

# Approach:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `max_distance`: To keep track of the maximum distance found.
   - `min_val`: The smallest element encountered so far, initialized with the smallest element of the first array.
   - `max_val`: The largest element encountered so far, initialized with the largest element of the first array.

2. **Iterate Through the Arrays**:
   - For each array (starting from the second one), calculate two potential distances:
     - Distance between the current array's maximum value and the minimum value seen so far (`current_max - min_val`).
     - Distance between the maximum value seen so far and the current array's minimum value (`max_val - current_min`).
   - Update `max_distance` with the maximum of these two distances.
   - Update `min_val` and `max_val` based on the current array's minimum and maximum values.

3. **Return the Maximum Distance**: After iterating through all arrays, return the `max_distance`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m)***, where m is the number of arrays. This is because we only make a single pass through the list of arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code:

```typescript
function maxDistance(arrays: number[][]): number {
    let max_distance = 0;
    let min_val = arrays[0][0];
    let max_val = arrays[0][arrays[0].length - 1];

    for (let i = 1; i < arrays.length; i++) {
        const current_min = arrays[i][0];
        const current_max = arrays[i][arrays[i].length - 1];

        max_distance = Math.max(max_distance, Math.abs(current_max - min_val), Math.abs(max_val - current_min));

        min_val = Math.min(min_val, current_min);
        max_val = Math.max(max_val, current_max);
    }

    return max_distance;
};

```
## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(maxDistance([[1,2,3],[4,5],[1,2,3]])); // Output: 4
console.log(maxDistance([[1],[1]])); // Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Setup**: We start by initializing the minimum and maximum values using the first array's minimum and maximum.
- **Iteration**: For each subsequent array, calculate the maximum possible distance using the current array's minimum and maximum compared to the global min and max.
- **Update**: Update the global min and max to include the current array's min and max.
- **Final Answer**: The maximum distance after iterating through all arrays is returned.
