[1482. Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-days-to-make-m-bouquets/)

# Intuition

1. **Binary Search on Days**:
   - Since the minimum number of days required to make `m` bouquets is bounded by the range of bloom days, we can use binary search to efficiently find this minimum.
   - The search space for the number of days ranges from the minimum day in `bloomDay` to the maximum day in `bloomDay`.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For a given day, we need to check if we can make `m` bouquets using the flowers that have bloomed by that day.
   - This can be done by iterating through the `bloomDay` array and counting the number of valid bouquets we can form.

# Approach

1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - Set the left boundary (`left`) to the minimum value in `bloomDay`.
   - Set the right boundary (`right`) to the maximum value in `bloomDay`.

2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - For each mid-point (`mid`) in the binary search, use a helper function to check if we can form at least `m` bouquets by day `mid`.
   - Adjust the binary search boundaries based on the feasibility check.

3. **Feasibility Helper Function**:
   - Iterate through the `bloomDay` array.
   - Count consecutive bloomed flowers that can form a bouquet.
   - Reset the count if a flower hasn't bloomed by the given day.
   - Increment the bouquet count each time we have `k` consecutive bloomed flowers.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log D)***, where *n* is the length of `bloomDay` and *D* is the range of bloom days.
  - The binary search takes ***O(log D)***.
  - Each feasibility check takes ***O(n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function minDays(bloomDay: number[], m: number, k: number): number {
    const n = bloomDay.length;
    
    if (m * k > n) {
        return -1;
    }

    function canMakeBouquets(day: number): boolean {
        let bouquets = 0;
        let flowers = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (bloomDay[i] <= day) {
                flowers++;
                if (flowers === k) {
                    bouquets++;
                    flowers = 0;
                    if (bouquets >= m) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                flowers = 0;
            }
        }

        return bouquets >= m;
    }

    let left = Math.min(...bloomDay);
    let right = Math.max(...bloomDay);

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canMakeBouquets(mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};

```
