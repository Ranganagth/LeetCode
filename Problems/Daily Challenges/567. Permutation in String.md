[567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

# Intuition:

We are tasked with determining if one of the permutations of string `s1` is a substring of string `s2`. A permutation of a string is a rearrangement of its characters, and the task is to check whether any such rearrangement exists as a contiguous substring within `s2`.

### Key Observations:

1. **Permutation Properties**:
   - A permutation of `s1` must have the same length and characters (with the same frequency) as `s1`. Therefore, the problem boils down to checking if any substring of `s2` of length equal to `s1` has the same frequency of characters as `s1`.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Instead of generating all permutations of `s1` (which would be inefficient), we can use a sliding window of size equal to `s1.length` and slide it across `s2`. For each window, we can check if the frequency of characters in the window matches the frequency of characters in `s1`.

3. **Character Frequency Matching**:
   - We'll maintain a frequency count of characters for both `s1` and the current window in `s2`. If the frequency counts match at any point, it means we have found a permutation of `s1` in `s2`.

# Approach:

1. **Frequency Count Arrays**:
   - We can use two arrays (or hashmaps) to track the frequency of each character in `s1` and the current window in `s2`.
   
2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Start with the first `s1.length` characters in `s2`, and compare the frequency counts. Then, slide the window one character at a time across `s2` by updating the frequency counts (adding the new character that enters the window and removing the old character that leaves the window).
   
3. **Comparison**:
   - At each step, compare the frequency arrays for the current window and `s1`. If they match, return `true`. If no match is found after scanning `s2`, return `false`.

# Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` is the length of `s2` and `m` is the length of `s1`. This is because we scan through `s2` once and perform character frequency comparisons in constant time (as the alphabet size is constant).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we use fixed-size arrays (or hashmaps) of size 26 to store the frequency of characters (for lowercase English letters).

# Code:

```typescript
function checkInclusion(s1: string, s2: string): boolean {
    const n = s1.length;
    const m = s2.length;

    if (n > m) return false;

    const s1Freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const s2Freq = new Array(26).fill(0);

    const charIndex = (char: string) => char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        s1Freq[charIndex(s1[i])]++;
        s2Freq[charIndex(s2[i])]++;
    }

    const matches = (arr1: number[], arr2: number[]) => {
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (arr1[i] !== arr2[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    };

    if (matches(s1Freq, s2Freq)) return true;

    for (let i = n; i < m; i++) {
        s2Freq[charIndex(s2[i])]++;

        s2Freq[charIndex(s2[i - n])]--;

        if (matches(s1Freq, s2Freq)) return true;
    }

    return false;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize two arrays, `s1Freq` and `s2Freq`, of size 26 to store the frequency of each character in `s1` and the current window in `s2`, respectively. The index of each character is calculated using the `charIndex` helper function (`a=0`, `b=1`, ..., `z=25`).

2. **Initial Frequency Count**:
   - We count the frequency of characters in `s1` and the first `n` characters (where `n` is the length of `s1`) of `s2`.

3. **Frequency Comparison**:
   - After initializing the frequency arrays, we check if the initial window in `s2` matches the frequency of `s1`. If they match, it means we have found a permutation of `s1` in `s2`, so we return `true`.

4. **Sliding the Window**:
   - If the initial window doesn't match, we slide the window one character at a time across `s2`. At each step, we:
     - Add the new character that enters the window.
     - Remove the old character that leaves the window.
     - Compare the updated frequency arrays.

5. **Final Check**:
   - If we find a matching window during the sliding process, we return `true`. If no match is found by the time we finish sliding through `s2`, we return `false`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidbaooo"`
- **Initial Frequency Count**:
  - `s1Freq` = [1, 1, 0, ..., 0] (for 'a' and 'b')
  - Initial window in `s2 = "ei"` → `s2Freq` = [0, 0, 1, ..., 1] (for 'e' and 'i')
- **Sliding the Window**:
  - Window = "eid" → `s2Freq` = [0, 0, 1, ..., 1] (no match)
  - Window = "idb" → `s2Freq` = [1, 1, 0, ..., 1] (matches `s1Freq`)
- Output: `true`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `s1 = "ab"`, `s2 = "eidboaoo"`
- **Initial Frequency Count**:
  - `s1Freq` = [1, 1, 0, ..., 0] (for 'a' and 'b')
  - Initial window in `s2 = "ei"` → `s2Freq` = [0, 0, 1, ..., 1] (for 'e' and 'i')
- **Sliding the Window**:
  - No window matches the frequency of `s1`.
- Output: `false`

### Conclusion:

The sliding window technique with character frequency comparison efficiently checks for a permutation of `s1` in `s2`. The solution runs in ***O(n + m)***, making it scalable for large inputs.
