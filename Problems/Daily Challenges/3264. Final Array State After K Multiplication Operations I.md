[3264. Final Array State After K Multiplication Operations I](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-array-state-after-k-multiplication-operations-i/)

# Intuition

The problem involves finding and modifying the minimum element of an array multiple times, while considering the constraints:
1. The array has at most 100 elements, so we can afford to linearly search for the minimum element.
2. Each operation selects the first occurrence of the minimum value and replaces it with its product with the multiplier.
By simulating the process step-by-step for kk operations, the problem can be solved efficiently without requiring advanced data structures.
# Approach

1. **Iterative Simulation**:    
    - Perform kk iterations, during each of which:
        - Identify the **minimum element** in the array (scan through it).
        - Replace the first occurrence of this minimum with its product with the multiplier.
2. **Replacement**:
    - After finding the index of the minimum, update the array value at that index.
3. **Return Final Array**:
    - After kk operations, return the modified array.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:    
    - For each of the kk operations, we scan the array once to find the minimum element.
    - Let *n* be the size of the array.
    - Total time complexity: **O(k ⋅ n)**. Given constraints **(n ≤ 100, k≤10)**, this is efficient.

2. **Space Complexity**:
    - ***O(1)*** additional space, as the operations are performed in place.

# Code

```typescript
function getFinalState(nums: number[], k: number, multiplier: number): number[] {
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        // Find the index of the first minimum element
        let minIndex = 0;
        for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }
        // Multiply the minimum element by the multiplier
        nums[minIndex] *= multiplier;
    }
    return nums;
}
```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

```typescript
const nums = [2, 1, 3, 5, 6];
const k = 5;
const multiplier = 2;
console.log(modifyArray(nums, k, multiplier)); // Output: [8, 4, 6, 5, 6]
```

**Steps**:

1. Initial Array: `[2, 1, 3, 5, 6]`
2. Operation 1: Find minimum *1*, replace it with **1 × 2 = 2**: `[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]`
3. Operation 2: Find minimum *2* (first occurrence), replace it with **2 × 2 = 4**: `[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]`
4. Operation 3: Find minimum *2*, replace it with **2 × 2 = 4**: `[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]`
5. Operation 4: Find minimum *3*, replace it with **3 × 2 = 6**: `[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]`
6. Operation 5: Find minimum *4*, replace it with **4 × 2 = 8**: `[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]`

**Final Array**: `[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]`

#### **Example 2**

```typescript
const nums = [1, 2];
const k = 3;
const multiplier = 4;
console.log(modifyArray(nums, k, multiplier)); // Output: [16, 8]
```

**Steps**:

1. Initial Array: `[1, 2]`
2. Operation 1: Find minimum *1*, replace it with **1 × 4 = 4**: `[4, 2]`
3. Operation 2: Find minimum *2*, replace it with **2 × 4 = 8**: `[4, 8]`
4. Operation 3: Find minimum *4*, replace it with **4 × 4 = 16**: `[16, 8]`

**Final Array**: `[16, 8]`

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Element Array**:
    - Input: `nums = [5], k = 3, multiplier = 2`
    - Output: `[40]` (Repeated multiplication on the same element)
2. **All Elements Equal**:
    - Input: `nums = [3, 3, 3], k = 2, multiplier = 3`
    - Output: `[27, 9, 3]` (First occurrence is updated repeatedly)
3. **Large k**:
    - Input: `nums = [2, 1, 2], k = 10, multiplier = 2`
    - Ensure no runtime issues despite multiple iterations.

This approach efficiently handles all cases and provides the correct result.
