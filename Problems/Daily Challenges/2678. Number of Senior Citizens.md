[2678. Number of Senior Citizens](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/)

# Intuition

Given the constraints of the problem, the task is to parse specific parts of each string to determine the age of each passenger. Since the format of each string is fixed and the age information is always located at the same positions, we can directly extract the age and convert it to an integer. The goal is to count how many of these ages are greater than 60.

# Approach

1. **Extract Age Information**: For each string in the `details` array, extract the characters at the 11th and 12th positions (0-based index 10 and 11) to get the age.
2. **Convert to Integer**: Convert the extracted substring representing the age to an integer.
3. **Check the Condition**: Check if the age is greater than 60.
4. **Count Valid Ages**: Maintain a counter to keep track of how many passengers meet the age condition.
5. **Return the Count**: After processing all the strings, return the count.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the number of strings in the `details` array. We iterate through each string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we only use a few extra variables for counting and parsing.

# Code 

```typescript
function countSeniorPassengers(details: string[]): number {
    let seniorCount = 0;

    for (const detail of details) {
        const age = parseInt(detail.slice(11, 13));
        if (age > 60) {
            seniorCount++;
        }
    }

    return seniorCount;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(countSeniorPassengers(["7868190130M7522", "5303914400F9211", "9273338290F4010"])); // Output: 2
console.log(countSeniorPassengers(["1313579440F2036", "2921522980M5644"])); // Output: 0
```

### Explanation of Examples


* **Example 1**:
	Consider the input: `["7868190130M7522", "5303914400F9211", "9273338290F4010"]`.

1. **First string**: `"7868190130M7522"`
   - Age substring: `"75"`
   - Convert to integer: `75`
   - Check condition: `75 > 60` (True)
   - Increment counter: `counter = 1`

2. **Second string**: `"5303914400F9211"`
   - Age substring: `"92"`
   - Convert to integer: `92`
   - Check condition: `92 > 60` (True)
   - Increment counter: `counter = 2`

3. **Third string**: `"9273338290F4010"`
   - Age substring: `"40"`
   - Convert to integer: `40`
   - Check condition: `40 > 60` (False)
   - Counter remains: `counter = 2`

Final output: `2`

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `["1313579440F2036", "2921522980M5644"]`
   - The ages extracted are `20` and `56`.
   - No passengers are over `60`.
   - Output: `0`
