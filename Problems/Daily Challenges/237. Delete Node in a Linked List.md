[Delete Node in a Linked List - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-05)

# Intuition
To delete a node from a singly-linked list, we can simply copy the value of the next node to the node to be deleted and then delete the next node.

# Approach
1. Copy the value of the next node to the node to be deleted.
2. Set the next pointer of the node to be deleted to the node next to the next node.
3. The node is now effectively removed from the linked list.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(1)***
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
        this.next = next === undefined ? null : next;
    }
}

function deleteNode(node: ListNode | null): void {
    if (!node || !node.next) return;

    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
};
```
