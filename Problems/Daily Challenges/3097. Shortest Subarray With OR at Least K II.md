[3097. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-subarray-with-or-at-least-k-ii/)

# Intuition

The key to optimizing the solution lies in reducing the amount of bitwise operations performed when updating the bitwise OR value, `s`, of a subarray. Instead of recalculating `s` completely for each subarray, we keep track of the count of each bit in the subarray. This allows us to efficiently manage the bitwise OR as we slide our window through `nums`.

The idea is:
1. Expand the window by including elements from the right.
2. Track the number of set bits at each position across the elements in the current window using an array, `cnt`.
3. If the bitwise OR of the current window, `s`, meets or exceeds `k`, we try to minimize the window by incrementing `i` (the start of the window).
4. If a bit count drops to zero as we increment `i`, adjust `s` by toggling off that bit.

# Approach

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `ans` with a value greater than the array length (infinity-like), representing the minimum length of the subarray that satisfies the condition.
   - Use an array `cnt` of size `32` (for each bit position) to keep track of how many times each bit is set within the current window.

2. **Expand the Window (`j`):**
   - For each `nums[j]`, add it to `s` using a bitwise OR.
   - Update the `cnt` array to count each bit position that is set in `nums[j]`.

3. **Shrink the Window (`i`):**
   - If `s >= k`, record the length of the current window (`j - i + 1`) as `ans`.
   - Increment `i` to try to minimize the window while maintaining `s >= k`.
   - When incrementing `i`, decrease the bit counts in `cnt`. If a bit count becomes zero, toggle off that bit in `s`.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - If `ans` was updated, return it as the minimum length; otherwise, return `-1` if no valid subarray was found.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n * 32)***, where `n` is the length of `nums`. For each `nums[j]`, we iterate over a fixed number of bits (32), making this effectively `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(32) = O(1)***, because `cnt` has a fixed size.

# Code:

```typescript
function minimumSubarrayLength(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    let ans = n + 1;
    const cnt: number[] = new Array<number>(32).fill(0);
    let s = 0;

    for (let i = 0, j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        s |= nums[j];

        for (let h = 0; h < 32; ++h) {
            if ((nums[j] >> h) & 1) {
                ++cnt[h];
            }
        }

        while (s >= k && i <= j) {
            ans = Math.min(ans, j - i + 1);
            for (let h = 0; h < 32; ++h) {
                if ((nums[i] >> h) & 1) {
                    if (--cnt[h] === 0) {
                        s ^= (1 << h);
                    }
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
    }

    return ans === n + 1 ? -1 : ans;
};

```

### Explanation Walkthrough

#### Example 1: `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `k = 2`

1. **Initialize:**  
   - `s = 0`, `ans = 4`, `cnt = [0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (32 elements).

2. **Right Pointer Expansions:**  
   - `j = 0`: `s |= 1` → `s = 1`. Update `cnt[0] += 1`.
   - `j = 1`: `s |= 2` → `s = 3` (meets `k = 2`). Update `cnt[1] += 1`.

3. **Shrink Window (i = 0):**  
   - `ans = 2`, `i = 1`. Update `cnt[0] = 0`, so `s ^= 1` → `s = 2`.
   - `ans = 1`.

4. **Final Answer:** `ans = 1` (shortest subarray is `[3]`).

#### Example 2: `nums = [2, 1, 8]`, `k = 10`

1. **Initialize:**  
   - `s = 0`, `ans = 4`, `cnt = [0, ..., 0]`.

2. **Right Pointer Expansions:**  
   - `j = 0`: `s |= 2` → `s = 2`.
   - `j = 1`: `s |= 1` → `s = 3`.
   - `j = 2`: `s |= 8` → `s = 11` (meets `k = 10`).

3. **Shrink Window (i = 0):**  
   - `ans = 3`. Update `cnt`, toggle bits as necessary.
   - Final Answer: `3` (subarray `[2, 1, 8]`).

### Explanation

This solution efficiently manages the bitwise OR of a sliding window by tracking bit counts, allowing quick updates as elements enter or exit the window. This minimizes the length of operations needed to find the shortest valid subarray.
