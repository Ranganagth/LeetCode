[3333. Find the Original Typed String II](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-ii/)

### Problem Summary

Alice types a string `word`, but she might have **pressed a key too long**, which results in **repeating characters**. You are given a number `k`, and the task is to **count the number of possible original strings (of length ≥ `k`)** that she might have meant to type.

A character group (like `"aaa"`) could have been intended as `"a"`, `"aa"`, or `"aaa"` — **any prefix** of the group. You want to compute the total number of such combinations where the final string has **length ≥ `k`**.

Return the result **modulo 10⁹ + 7**.

# Intuition

* We treat each contiguous block of same characters (e.g., `"aaa"`) as one group.
* Each group of length `x` can be reduced to **any length from 1 to x** → **`x` choices**.
* So the **total number of possible combinations** is the **product of group sizes**.
* Now we must subtract combinations that result in strings of length `< k`.

---

# Approach

1. **Count character groups:**
   * Traverse the string and record lengths of consecutive character groups.
   * e.g., `"aabbcc"` → groups: `[2, 2, 2]`

2. **Calculate total combinations:**
   * Multiply group sizes: `2 * 2 * 2 = 8`

3. **Use DP to count how many combinations have length `< k`:**
   * `f[j]` = number of combinations that produce strings of length `j`.
   * `g[j]` = prefix sum of `f[j]` for efficient range updates.
   * For each group, use previous `g` to build the new `f`.

4. **Answer = total combinations - combinations with length < k**

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(k * G)`
  Where `G` = number of character groups (≤ `n`)

* **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`
  For storing DP arrays

# Code

```ts
function possibleStringCount(word: string, k: number): number {
    const mod: number = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = word.length;
    const freq: number[] = [];

    // Step 1: Group consecutive characters
    let cnt = 1;
    for (let i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        if (word[i] === word[i - 1]) {
            ++cnt;
        } else {
            freq.push(cnt);
            cnt = 1;
        }
    }
    freq.push(cnt);

    // Step 2: Total combinations (product of each group size)
    let ans = 1;
    for (const count of freq) {
        ans = (ans * count) % mod;
    }

    // Step 3: If group count >= k, all strings will be ≥ k
    if (freq.length >= k) return ans;

    // Step 4: DP to count strings with length < k
    let f: number[] = new Array(k).fill(0);
    let g: number[] = new Array(k).fill(1);  // prefix sums
    f[0] = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < freq.length; ++i) {
        const f_new: number[] = new Array(k).fill(0);
        for (let j = 1; j < k; ++j) {
            f_new[j] = g[j - 1];
            if (j - freq[i] - 1 >= 0) {
                f_new[j] = (f_new[j] - g[j - freq[i] - 1] + mod) % mod;
            }
        }
        const g_new: number[] = new Array(k).fill(0);
        g_new[0] = f_new[0];
        for (let j = 1; j < k; ++j) {
            g_new[j] = (g_new[j - 1] + f_new[j]) % mod;
        }
        f = f_new;
        g = g_new;
    }

    // Step 5: Answer = total - strings of length < k
    return (ans - g[k - 1] + mod) % mod;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

```ts
word = "aabbccdd", k = 7
groups = [2, 2, 2, 2]
Total combinations = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16
Using DP, combinations with length < 7 = 11
Answer = 16 - 11 = 5
```

#### Example 2:

```ts
word = "aabbccdd", k = 8
Only one possible string of full length
Answer = 1
```

#### Example 3:

```ts
word = "aaabbb", k = 3
groups = [3, 3]
Total = 3 * 3 = 9
Combinations with length < 3 = 1
Answer = 9 - 1 = 8
```

---

### **Summary**

* Uses **grouping** and **dynamic programming** to count valid subsequences.
* Fast and memory efficient even for `word.length = 5 * 10⁵`.
* Subtracts unwanted short combinations from total.
