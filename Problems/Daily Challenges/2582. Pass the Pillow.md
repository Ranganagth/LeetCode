[2582. Pass the Pillow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/)

# Intuition

The problem involves passing a pillow back and forth among `n` people in a line. The direction changes whenever the pillow reaches either end of the line. This can be visualized as a sequence where the direction of passing the pillow alternates between forward and backward as it reaches the end of the line.

# Approach

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the passing of the pillow:

1. **Determine the Total Length of the Cycle**: 
   - A full cycle consists of the pillow being passed from the first person to the last person and then back to the first person. This is `2n - 2` seconds long (since the pillow is passed `n-1` times to the last person and then `n-1` times back to the first person).

2. **Calculate the Effective Time**:
   - Since the passing is cyclic, we can reduce the problem by taking the time modulo the cycle length: `effective_time = time % (2n - 2)`.

3. **Simulate the Passing**:
   - Depending on the `effective_time`, we can determine if the pillow is in the forward or backward pass:
     - If `effective_time` is less than `n`, the pillow is still moving forward.
     - Otherwise, it has reached the end and is moving backward.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)*** because the solution involves a few arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

# Code
```typescript
function findPillowHolder(n: number, time: number): number {
    const cycleLength = 2 * n - 2;
    const effectiveTime = time % cycleLength;

    if (effectiveTime < n) {
        return effectiveTime + 1;
    } else {
        return 2 * n - 1 - effectiveTime;
    }
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Cycle Length Calculation**:
   - `const cycleLength = 2 * n - 2;` calculates the length of a complete cycle (forward and backward pass).

2. **Effective Time Calculation**:
   - `const effectiveTime = time % cycleLength;` reduces the problem to within a single cycle using the modulo operation.

3. **Simulating the Passing**:
   - If `effectiveTime < n`, it means the pillow is still moving forward, so the holder's index is `effectiveTime + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the pillow is moving backward, and the holder's index can be calculated as `2 * n - 1 - effectiveTime`.
