[2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-1d-array-into-2d-array/)

# Intuition

The problem is essentially about reshaping a 1D array into a 2D array. The key point to note is that reshaping is only possible if the total number of elements in the 1D array matches the required number of elements in the 2D array (`m * n`). If the lengths don't match, it's impossible to reshape the array, and we should return an empty array.

# Approach

1. **Check Feasibility**: First, ensure that the length of the `original` array matches `m * n`. If not, return an empty array.

2. **Reshape the Array**: If the length matches, we can proceed to fill the 2D array row by row.
   - Loop through the `original` array, and for each group of `n` elements, create a new row in the 2D array.

3. **Return the Result**: Once all elements are arranged into rows, return the resulting 2D array.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** because we iterate over the entire `original` array once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** for storing the 2D array.

# Code:

```typescript
function construct2DArray(original: number[], m: number, n: number): number[][] {
    if (original.length !== m * n) {
        return [];
    }

    const result: number[][] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        const row: number[] = [];
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            row.push(original[i * n + j]);
        }
        result.push(row);
    }

    return result;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(construct2DArray([1,2,3,4], 2, 2)); // Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
console.log(construct2DArray([1,2,3], 1, 3));   // Output: [[1, 2, 3]]
console.log(construct2DArray([1,2], 1, 1));     // Output: []
```

### Explanation

- **Feasibility Check**: We first check if the total number of elements required in the 2D array (which is `m * n`) matches the number of elements in the `original` array. If not, we immediately return an empty array.
  
- **Row Formation**: For each row `i` in the 2D array, we loop over `n` columns and pick elements from the `original` array starting at the index `i * n`. These elements are added to a new row which is then pushed to the result.

- **Result**: After looping through all elements, the `result` 2D array contains all elements arranged row by row, as required.
