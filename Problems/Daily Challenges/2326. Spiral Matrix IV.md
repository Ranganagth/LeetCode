[2326. Spiral Matrix IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/)

# Intuition

We need to fill an `m x n` matrix with values from a linked list in spiral order. Spiral order means starting from the top-left corner, moving right across the row, then down the rightmost column, then left across the bottom row, and finally up the leftmost column, repeating the process inwards until the entire matrix is filled. If the linked list runs out of values before the matrix is full, we need to fill the remaining cells with `-1`.

# Approach

1. **Matrix Initialization**: Start by creating an empty `m x n` matrix filled with `-1`. This ensures that we can directly fill values from the linked list and mark unfilled cells with `-1`.
    
2. **Traverse the Linked List**: Begin at the top-left of the matrix and traverse it in spiral order:
    
    - First, move **right** along the top row.
    - Then move **down** along the right column.
    - Then move **left** along the bottom row.
    - Finally, move **up** along the left column.
    - Continue shrinking the boundaries and repeat this process until the matrix is filled or the linked list is exhausted.
3. **Fill Matrix**: As we traverse the matrix in spiral order, insert values from the linked list into the matrix. Once the linked list is exhausted, continue filling any remaining spaces with `-1`.
    
4. **Boundary Updates**: Adjust the boundaries after each complete traversal of a row or column. For example, after moving right across the top row, the top boundary should move down one row.
    

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We traverse the matrix once to fill it.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, for storing the matrix.

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function spiralMatrix(m: number, n: number, head: ListNode | null): number[][] {
    const matrix: number[][] = new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(-1));

    let top = 0, bottom = m - 1;
    let left = 0, right = n - 1;
    
    let current = head;

    while (current !== null && top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        for (let i = left; i <= right && current !== null; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = current.val;
            current = current.next;
        }
        top++;
        
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom && current !== null; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = current.val;
            current = current.next;
        }
        right--;
        
        for (let i = right; i >= left && current !== null; i--) {
            matrix[bottom][i] = current.val;
            current = current.next;
        }
        bottom--;
        
        for (let i = bottom; i >= top && current !== null; i--) {
            matrix[i][left] = current.val;
            current = current.next;
        }
        left++;
    }

    return matrix;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **ListNode Class**: Represents a node in the linked list with a `val` for its value and `next` for the next node pointer.
    
2. **Matrix Initialization**:
    
    - We first create a 2D array `matrix` of size `m x n` filled with `-1`. This will hold the final matrix with spiral order traversal.
3. **Spiral Traversal**:
    
    - We use four boundaries (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) to manage the shrinking area of the matrix that needs to be filled.
    - We begin by traversing the top row from left to right, then move down the rightmost column, then left across the bottom row, and finally up the leftmost column.
    - After each traversal, we shrink the boundaries inward by adjusting the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
4. **Linked List Traversal**: As we move through the matrix in spiral order, we assign the values from the linked list to the matrix cells. When the linked list runs out of nodes, we stop updating and leave the rest of the matrix cells as `-1`.
    
5. **Return**: The final matrix, filled in spiral order, is returned as the output.
    

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

Input: `m = 3, n = 5`, `head = [3,0,2,6,8,1,7,9,4,2,5,5,0]`

- Matrix initialization:
```typescript
[[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
 [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]
```

* Spiral fill:
1. First row: `[3, 0, 2, 6, 8]`
2. Right column: `[1]`
3. Bottom row (reversed): `[7, 9, 4]`
4. Left column (reversed): `[5, 5]`
5. Remaining row: `[0, 2]`

Result:
```typescript
[[3, 0, 2, 6, 8],
 [5, 0, -1, -1, 1],
 [5, 2, 4, 9, 7]]
```

#### Example 2:

Input: `m = 1, n = 4`, `head = [0, 1, 2]`

- Matrix initialization:
```typescript
[[-1, -1, -1, -1]]
```

* Spiral fill:

1. First row: `[0, 1, 2]`
2. Remaining element: `[-1]`

Result:
```typescript
[[0, 1, 2, -1]]
```
