[78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)

# Intuition
The idea is to use recursion to explore two choices for each element in the array: either include the element in the current subset or exclude it. By making these choices recursively for all elements, we can generate all possible subsets.

# Approach
1. **Recursive Backtracking**: Start with an empty subset and consider each element in the array. For each element, decide to either:
   - Include it in the current subset.
   - Exclude it from the current subset.
2. **Base Case**: When we have considered all elements, add the current subset to the list of all subsets.
3. **Recursive Step**: Move to the next element and repeat the process.

# Explanation
1. **Helper Function `backtrack`**:
   - Takes the current starting index `start` and the current subset `currentSubset`.
   - Adds the current subset to the `result` list.
   - Iterates through the remaining elements starting from `start`, adds each element to the current subset, and recursively calls `backtrack` with the next starting index.
   - After the recursive call, removes the last element to backtrack and explore other possibilities.
2. **Initial Call**: The recursion starts with the starting index `0` and an empty subset.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ ⋅ n)***, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. There are `2ⁿ` subsets, and generating each subset takes ***O(n)*** time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ ⋅ n)*** to store all subsets.

# Code
```typescript
function subsets(nums: number[]): number[][] {
    const result: number[][] = [];
    
    const backtrack = (start: number, currentSubset: number[]) => {
        result.push([...currentSubset]);
        
        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentSubset.push(nums[i]);
            backtrack(i + 1, currentSubset);
            currentSubset.pop();
        }
    };
    
    backtrack(0, []);
    return result;
};

```
