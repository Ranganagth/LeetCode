[1861. Rotating the Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotating-the-box/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of simulating gravity and rotating the box:
1. **Gravity Simulation**: Stones (`#`) fall downward until stopped by an obstacle (`*`) or the bottom of the box.
2. **Matrix Rotation**: After simulating gravity for each row, rotate the entire matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

This involves two main operations: simulating the fall of stones within rows and transforming the matrix to achieve the desired rotation.

# Approach

1. **Simulate Gravity**:    
    - For each row, treat it as a "fall zone" for stones.
    - Traverse the row backward to let stones fall down:
        - Use a pointer to track the current position where a stone can fall.
        - Obstacles (`*`) stop the movement of stones and reset the pointer.
2. **Rotate the Matrix**:
    - After processing all rows, rotate the matrix clockwise:
        - Transpose the matrix.
        - Reverse each row of the transposed matrix.
3. **Return the Result**:
    - The result is the rotated matrix where all stones have fallen due to gravity.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: ***O(m×n)***
    - Gravity simulation for all rows: ***O(m×n)***.
    - Matrix rotation (transpose + reverse): ***O(m×n)***.
2. **Space Complexity**: ***O(m×n)***
    - Space required for the rotated matrix.

# Code 

```typescript
function rotateTheBox(box: string[][]): string[][] {
    const m = box.length;
    const n = box[0].length;

    // Simulate gravity for each row
    for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
        let empty = n - 1; // Pointer to where the next stone can fall
        for (let col = n - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
            if (box[row][col] === '#') {
                // Move the stone to the last empty spot
                box[row][col] = '.';
                box[row][empty] = '#';
                empty--;
            } else if (box[row][col] === '*') {
                // Reset the empty spot pointer at the obstacle
                empty = col - 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
    const rotated: string[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m).fill('.'));
    for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            rotated[col][m - 1 - row] = box[row][col];
        }
    }

    return rotated;
};

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

**Input**:

```text
box = [["#",".","#"]]
```

**Steps**:

1. Simulate gravity: 
    - Row 0: Stones fall to the bottom → `["#","#","."]`.
2. Rotate clockwise:
    - Transpose → `["#"], ["#"], ["."]`.
**Output**:
```text
[["."],
 ["#"],
 ["#"]]
```

#### Example 2

**Input**:

```text
box = [
    ["#",".","*","."],
    ["#","#","*","."]
]
```

**Steps**:

1. Simulate gravity:    
    - Row 0: `["#",".","*","."]` → `[".",".","*","#"]`.
    - Row 1: `["#","#","*","."]` → `[".",".","*","#"]`.
2. Rotate clockwise:
    - Transpose → `["#","#"], [".","."], ["*","*"], [".","."]`.
**Output**:
```text
[["#","."],
 ["#","#"],
 ["*","*"],
 [".","."]]
```

#### Example 3

**Input**:

```text
box = [
    ["#","#","*",".","*","."],
    ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
    ["#","#","#",".","#","."]
]
```

**Steps**:

1. Simulate gravity:    
    - Row 0: `["#","#","*",".","*","."]` → `["#","#","*",".","*","."]` (no change).
    - Row 1: `["#","#","#","*",".","."]` → `[".","#","#","*",".","#"]`.
    - Row 2: `["#","#","#",".","#","."]` → `[".","#","#",".","#","#"]`.
2. Rotate clockwise:
    - Transpose → Rotate → Output as below.
**Output**:
```text
[[".","#","#"],
 [".","#","#"],
 ["#","#","*"],
 ["#","*","."],
 ["#",".","*"],
 ["#",".","."]]
```

### Key Insights

- Gravity is simulated independently for each row.
- Rotating the matrix involves a standard transpose and reverse operation.
- The approach ensures correctness while maintaining efficiency.
