[2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-subsequence-of-length-k-with-the-largest-sum/)

### Problem Understanding

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to return a **subsequence of length `k`** that gives the **maximum possible sum**.

A **subsequence** means the **original order must be preserved**, even if you skip elements.

---

# Intuition

To get the maximum sum, you obviously want the **k largest elements** from `nums`. But since you need to **preserve the order**, you **cannot sort and return the top k elements directly**. You must find **which k largest elements appear earliest in the original order**.

---

# Approach

1. **Get the k largest values** and store them with counts.
2. **Traverse the array** and collect elements if they are in the top k values (until the needed frequency is satisfied), preserving the order.

### Step-by-Step Example

Input: `nums = [2, 1, 3, 3]`, `k = 2`

* Top 2 largest elements: `[3, 3]`
* Traverse `nums`:

  * 2 → not in top 2 → skip
  * 1 → not in top 2 → skip
  * 3 → take it
  * 3 → take it
    Output: `[3, 3]`

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **O(n log k)** to get k largest elements using a heap (or O(n log n) via sort).
* **O(n)** to traverse and collect.
* **Overall**: `O(n log n)` due to sorting.

---

# Code

```ts
function maxSubsequence(nums: number[], k: number): number[] {
    // Pair elements with their indices
    const indexed = nums.map((val, idx) => [val, idx]);
    // Sort by value descending, and take top k
    indexed.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
    const topK = indexed.slice(0, k);
    // Sort those top k elements by original index to preserve order
    topK.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    // Return only values
    return topK.map(pair => pair[0]);
};

```

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 2:

```ts
nums = [-1, -2, 3, 4], k = 3
```

* Top 3 values: `[4, 3, -1]`
* Their indices: `[(4, 3), (3, 2), (-1, 0)]`
* Sorted by index: `[(0, -1), (2, 3), (3, 4)]`
* Output: `[-1, 3, 4]`

---

### **Summary**

This problem is a **greedy + sorting** based solution where:

* You select the top `k` values,
* But **retain the original order** by tracking indices.

This ensures correctness both in terms of **sum** and **subsequence definition**.
