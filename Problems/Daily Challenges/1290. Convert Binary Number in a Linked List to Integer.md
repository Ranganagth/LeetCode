[1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

# Intuition

Each node in the singly linked list represents a **bit** of a binary number, with the **most significant bit at the head**.
We can think of it like reading the binary number from left to right, building the decimal value as we go.

For example, for the list `[1, 0, 1]`, the binary is `101`:
* Start with `0`
* Shift left and add each bit:
  `((0 << 1) + 1) = 1`
  `((1 << 1) + 0) = 2`
  `((2 << 1) + 1) = 5`

---

# Approach

We:
1. Initialize `num = 0`
2. Traverse the list:
   * For each node: `num = (num << 1) | node.val`
   * This shifts all previous bits left (multiplies by 2) and adds the current bit

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  (where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list)

* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  (only constant variables used, no extra data structures)

# Code

```ts
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = val ?? 0;
        this.next = next ?? null;
    }
}

function getDecimalValue(head: ListNode | null): number {
    let num = 0;
    let current = head;

    while (current !== null) {
        num = (num << 1) | current.val;
        current = current.next;
    }

    return num;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `[1, 0, 1]`

* Start: `num = 0`
* Node 1 (`1`): `num = (0 << 1) | 1 = 1`
* Node 2 (`0`): `num = (1 << 1) | 0 = 2`
* Node 3 (`1`): `num = (2 << 1) | 1 = 5`
* ✅ Output: `5`

---

### **Summary**

This is a straightforward **bitwise accumulation** problem.
Using `(num << 1) | bit` mimics how binary numbers are constructed and converted to decimal — efficient and elegant.
