[2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-closest-node-to-given-two-nodes/)

# Intuition
Each node has at most **one outgoing edge**, forming a structure of **disjoint paths** and possibly **simple cycles**.  
To solve the problem, we need to:

- Identify **all nodes reachable** from `node1` and `node2`, and the **distance** to each.
- For every node reachable from both `node1` and `node2`, compute the **maximum of the two distances**.
- Choose the node with the **smallest such maximum**. If there’s a tie, choose the **smallest index**.

# Approach

1. **Compute Distance Maps**:
   - From `node1`, traverse the graph and record distance to each reachable node.
   - Do the same from `node2`.

2. **Scan for Common Nodes**:
   - Iterate over all nodes. If a node exists in both distance maps, compute `max(distance_from_node1, distance_from_node2)`.

3. **Track Optimal Result**:
   - Keep track of the node with the **minimum of the maximum distances**.
   - Update if a smaller max distance is found, or if the same max distance occurs at a lower node index.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  `O(n)` for each traversal (since each node has only one edge, no revisits), total `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  `O(n)` to store distances from both `node1` and `node2`.

# Code

```ts
function closestMeetingNode(edges: number[], node1: number, node2: number): number {
    const n = edges.length;

    const getDistances = (start: number): number[] => {
        const dist = Array(n).fill(-1);
        let current = start, d = 0;
        while (current !== -1 && dist[current] === -1) {
            dist[current] = d++;
            current = edges[current];
        }
        return dist;
    };

    const dist1 = getDistances(node1);
    const dist2 = getDistances(node2);

    let minDist = Infinity;
    let result = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dist1[i] !== -1 && dist2[i] !== -1) {
            const maxDist = Math.max(dist1[i], dist2[i]);
            if (maxDist < minDist || (maxDist === minDist && i < result)) {
                minDist = maxDist;
                result = i;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:
```ts
edges = [2, 2, 3, -1], node1 = 0, node2 = 1
```

- From node 0: path = [0 → 2 → 3], distances = [0, -, 1, 2]
- From node 1: path = [1 → 2 → 3], distances = [-, 0, 1, 2]

- Common reachable nodes = [2, 3]
  - Node 2: max(1, 1) = 1
  - Node 3: max(2, 2) = 2

Minimum max distance is 1, at node 2 → **Output: 2**


#### Example 2:
```ts
edges = [1, 2, -1], node1 = 0, node2 = 2
```

- From node 0: path = [0 → 1 → 2], distances = [0, 1, 2]
- From node 2: path = [2], distances = [-, -, 0]

- Common reachable node = 2
  - Node 2: max(2, 0) = 2

Only one common node → **Output: 2**

### **Summary**

This problem is a great example of efficient traversal and distance mapping in sparse graphs. The restriction that each node has at most one outgoing edge simplifies the traversal, allowing an `O(n)` time solution even with up to $10^5$ nodes.
