[1945. Sum of Digits of String After Convert](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-of-string-after-convert/)

# Intuition

The problem requires converting a string of lowercase letters into its corresponding integer representation and then reducing this integer by summing its digits multiple times. The goal is to obtain a single integer after `k` transformation steps. The process involves multiple steps: converting characters to their positions in the alphabet, summing digits, and repeating the summation process as needed.

# Approach

1. **Convert Characters to Integer Representation**:
   - Each character in the string `s` is mapped to its position in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'z' = 26).
   - This conversion gives us a sequence of digits which we then concatenate into a single large number.

2. **Sum the Digits**:
   - Once we have the large number (represented as a string), we repeatedly sum its digits.
   - This step is repeated `k` times.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, the output is the sum of the digits from the first transformation.
   - The transformation is stopped once we reach `k` transformations.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The initial conversion of characters to their positions is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string.
  - The digit summation, in the worst case, can involve summing a number with a length of up to `2n` digits. The summation process happens `k` times, so the overall complexity is ***O(n * k)***.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is ***O(n)*** due to the storage of the intermediate string and integer values.

# Code:

```typescript
function getLucky(s: string, k: number): number {
    let numStr = "";
    for (let char of s) {
        const position = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
        numStr += position.toString();
    }

    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum = 0;
        for (let digit of numStr) {
            sum += parseInt(digit, 10);
        }
        numStr = sum.toString();
    }

    return sum;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(getLucky("iiii", 1)); // Output: 36
console.log(getLucky("leetcode", 2)); // Output: 6
console.log(getLucky("zbax", 2)); // Output: 8
```

### Explanation

1. **Character to Number Conversion**:
   - We iterate over each character in the string `s` and convert it to its corresponding number. For example, 'a' becomes `1`, 'z' becomes `26`.

2. **Summing Digits**:
   - We perform the summation of digits for `k` iterations. In each iteration, we reset the `sum` to `0`, iterate over each character (digit) in the current string, convert it to an integer, and add it to `sum`.

3. **Return Final Result**:
   - After `k` iterations, the final `sum` is returned as the result.
