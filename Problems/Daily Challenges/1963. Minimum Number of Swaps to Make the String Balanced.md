[1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of balancing a string consisting of brackets using the minimum number of swaps, we need to identify unmatched brackets. Specifically, we should focus on how many opening brackets `[` are unmatched after processing the string, as these indicate how many closing brackets `]` are not properly matched.

# Approach

1. **Counting Unmatched Opening Brackets**:
   - Iterate through the string character by character.
   - Maintain a counter `openBrackets` to track the number of unmatched opening brackets (`[`). 
   - For every opening bracket `[` found, increment `openBrackets`.
   - For every closing bracket `]` found, if there are unmatched opening brackets (i.e., `openBrackets > 0`), decrement the `openBrackets` counter (indicating a match).

2. **Calculate Swaps**:
   - At the end of the iteration, if there are unmatched opening brackets left (`openBrackets > 0`), the number of swaps needed is equal to half of `openBrackets`. This is because each swap can fix two unmatched brackets.
   - If `openBrackets` is odd, rounding up is necessary to account for the last unmatched opening bracket.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string, as we only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we are using a fixed number of variables regardless of the input size.

# Code

```typescript
function minSwaps(s: string): number {
    let openBrackets: number = 0;
    let swaps: number = 0;

    for (let c of s) {
        if (c === '[') {
            openBrackets++;
        } 
        else if (openBrackets > 0) {
            openBrackets--;
        }
    }
  
    swaps = Math.ceil(openBrackets / 2);
  
    return swaps;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `openBrackets` set to 0 to track unmatched opening brackets and `swaps` set to 0 to count how many swaps are needed.

2. **Iterate through String**:
   - For each character:
     - If it is `[`, increment `openBrackets`.
     - If it is `]` and `openBrackets` is greater than 0, decrement `openBrackets` (indicating a match).
     - If it is `]` and `openBrackets` is 0, this closing bracket is unmatched and would eventually contribute to the number of swaps needed, although the code directly addresses this through tracking only unmatched opening brackets.

3. **Calculating Swaps**:
   - After iterating through the string, if any unmatched opening brackets remain, calculate the swaps needed by dividing `openBrackets` by 2 and rounding up to account for the case of an odd count.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `s = "][]["`
- **Iteration Steps**:
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 1
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 1
- **Final `openBrackets`**: 1
- **Swaps Calculation**: `Math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
- **Output**: `1`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `s = "]]][[["`
- **Iteration Steps**:
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 1
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 2
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 3
- **Final `openBrackets`**: 3
- **Swaps Calculation**: `Math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
- **Output**: `2`

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `s = "[]"`
- **Iteration Steps**:
  - `[`: `openBrackets` = 1
  - `]`: `openBrackets` = 0
- **Final `openBrackets`**: 0
- **Swaps Calculation**: `Math.ceil(0 / 2) = 0`
- **Output**: `0`

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of swaps needed to balance the string of brackets. By focusing on unmatched opening brackets and utilizing simple arithmetic, we achieve an optimal solution with both time and space efficiency. Thank you for providing the correct implementation, which reinforces the importance of understanding bracket balancing in programming challenges.
