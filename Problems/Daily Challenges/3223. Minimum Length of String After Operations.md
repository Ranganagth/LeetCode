[3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-length-of-string-after-operations/)

# Intuition

The goal is to determine the minimum length of the string after repeatedly removing matching pairs of characters around a specific character. This involves:

1. Finding characters in the string that are surrounded by the same character.
2. Removing the closest matching characters to the left and right of the chosen character.

Instead of simulating the operations directly (which would be computationally expensive for large strings), we can focus on calculating the effective contribution of each character.

# Approach

1. **Observation**:
    - The pairs of identical characters surrounding a central character can always be removed.
    - Characters that appear an **odd number of times** will leave one unremovable character in the final string.
    - Characters that appear an **even number of times** can all be removed.
	
2. **Steps**:
    - Count the frequency of each character using a `Map`.
    - For each character:
        - If its frequency is odd, one instance will remain in the final string.
        - If its frequency is even, all occurrences can be removed.
		
3. **Result**:
    - Sum the unremovable instances to compute the minimum length of the string.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string. Counting character frequencies and summing contributions both take linear time.
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - ***O(26) = O(1)***, as we only store counts for lowercase English letters.

# Code

```typescript
function minimumLength(s: string): number {
    const count = new Map<string, number>();

    // Count the frequency of each character in the string
    for (const char of s) {
        count.set(char, (count.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }

    let minLength = 0;

    // Calculate the minimum length
    for (const freq of count.values()) {
        minLength += freq % 2 === 0 ? 2 : 1;
    }

    return minLength;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "abaacbcbb";
console.log(minimumLength(s)); // Output: 5
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Count frequencies:
    - `a: 3`, `b: 4`, `c: 2`.
2. Contributions:
    - `a: 1` (odd, 1 remains).
    - `b: 2` (even, all removed).
    - `c: 2` (even, all removed).
3. Minimum length = *1 + 2 + 2 = 5*.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "aa";
console.log(minimumLength(s)); // Output: 2
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Count frequencies:
    - `a: 2`.
2. Contributions:
    - `a: 2` (even, all removed).
3. Minimum length = *2*.

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
const s = "aabbccddeeff";
console.log(minimumLength(s)); // Output: 12
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Count frequencies:
    - Each character appears twice.
2. Contributions:
    - All characters are removed.
3. Minimum length = *12*.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Character**:
    - Input: *s = "a"*.
    - Output: *1* (Cannot remove anything).
	
2. **All Characters Unique**:
    - Input: *s = "abcdef"*.
    - Output: *6* (No removable pairs).
	
3. **Large Input**:
    - Efficiently handles ss with length up to *2Ã—10^5*
