[2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to minimize the total number of moves required to seat each student in a unique seat. A move is defined as incrementing or decrementing the position of a student by 1. The optimal way to achieve this is to align students with seats that are closest to their current positions.

# Approach

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort both the `seats` and `students` arrays. This way, we can pair the smallest available seat with the smallest student position, the second smallest with the second smallest, and so on.
   - Sorting ensures that the overall movement is minimized because it pairs each student with the closest available seat in a greedy manner.

2. **Calculate Moves**:
   - After sorting, calculate the absolute difference between each paired seat and student.
   - Sum up these differences to get the total number of moves required.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting of the `seats` and `students` arrays.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space, not counting the input arrays.

# Code
```typescript
function minMovesToSeat(seats: number[], students: number[]): number {
    seats.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    students.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let totalMoves = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < seats.length; i++) {
        totalMoves += Math.abs(seats[i] - students[i]);
    }
    
    return totalMoves;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: The `sort` function is used to sort the `seats` and `students` arrays in ascending order.
2. **Total Moves Calculation**:
   - We initialize `totalMoves` to 0.
   - We iterate through the sorted arrays, calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `seats` and `students`, and accumulate these differences into `totalMoves`.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the total number of moves required to seat all students.
