[2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/)

### Problem Summary

We are given an integer array `nums`. We need to count the number of *hills* and *valleys*.

* A **hill** is when the number has the closest *non-equal* neighbors **both smaller** than it.
* A **valley** is when the number has the closest *non-equal* neighbors **both larger** than it.
* If there are repeated equal numbers, they all belong to the same hill or valley.

---

# Intuition

To simplify checking conditions:

* We must **ignore consecutive duplicate values** (since they form a plateau and share the same classification).
* Then we can compare each element to its immediate *previous* and *next* **non-equal** values.

---

# Approach

1. **Clean the array**: Remove consecutive duplicates so we can check hills/valleys with immediate neighbors.
2. **Iterate from index 1 to n-2** of the cleaned array:
   * If `nums[i] > nums[i - 1] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`: it's a hill.
   * If `nums[i] < nums[i - 1] && nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`: it's a valley.
3. **Count and return the number of hills and valleys.**

---

# Complexity 

* **Time:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array.
* **Space:** O(n) for storing the cleaned array.

---

# Code

```ts
function countHillValley(nums: number[]): number {
    const cleaned: number[] = [nums[0]];

    // Step 1: Remove consecutive duplicates
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== nums[i - 1]) {
            cleaned.push(nums[i]);
        }
    }

    let count = 0;

    // Step 2: Iterate and check for hills and valleys
    for (let i = 1; i < cleaned.length - 1; i++) {
        if (cleaned[i] > cleaned[i - 1] && cleaned[i] > cleaned[i + 1]) {
            count++; // Hill
        } else if (cleaned[i] < cleaned[i - 1] && cleaned[i] < cleaned[i + 1]) {
            count++; // Valley
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### Example 1:

```ts
Input: nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5]
// Cleaned: [2, 4, 1, 6, 5]
Indices to check: 1 to 3

Index 1 → 4 > 2 && 4 > 1 → Hill
Index 2 → 1 < 4 && 1 < 6 → Valley
Index 3 → 6 > 1 && 6 > 5 → Hill

=> Output: 3
```

#### Example 2:

```ts
Input: nums = [6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 1]
// Cleaned: [6, 5, 4, 1]

Index 1 → 5 < 6 && 5 > 4 → Neither
Index 2 → 4 < 5 && 4 > 1 → Neither

=> Output: 0
```
