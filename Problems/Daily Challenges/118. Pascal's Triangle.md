[118. Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

# Intuition
To generate Pascal's triangle up to `numRows`, we need to understand that each number in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it from the previous row. The first and last elements of each row are always `1`.

# Approach
We will use an iterative approach to generate Pascal's triangle:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the rows of Pascal's triangle.
2. Iterate from `1` to `numRows`, inclusive, to generate each row.
3. For each row, initialize a list to store its elements.
4. The first and last elements of each row are set to `1`.
5. For the elements between the first and last elements, calculate each element as the sum of the elements directly above it in the previous row.
6. Append each row to the list of Pascal's triangle rows.
7. Return the list of rows.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(numRows²)*** since we need to generate each element of each row, and there are numRows rows in total.
- Space complexity: ***O(numRows²)*** since we store all elements of Pascal's triangle.

# Code
```typescript
function generate(numRows: number): number[][] {
    const pascalsTriangle: number[][] = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
        const row: number[] = [];
        
        for (let j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
            if (j === 0 || j === i) {
                row.push(1);
            } else {
                row.push(pascalsTriangle[i - 1][j - 1] + pascalsTriangle[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }
        
        pascalsTriangle.push(row);
    }
    
    return pascalsTriangle;
};
