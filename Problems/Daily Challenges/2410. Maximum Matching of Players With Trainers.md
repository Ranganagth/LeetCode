[2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matching-of-players-with-trainers/)

# Intuition

We need to **maximize the number of player-trainer matchings** such that:
- A player `p` can only match with a trainer `t` if `p <= t`.
- Each player and each trainer can be used at most once.

This is a classic **greedy two-pointer matching** problem — similar to "Assign Cookies".

# Approach

1. **Sort both arrays** (`players` and `trainers`) in ascending order.
2. Use **two pointers** (`i` for players, `j` for trainers):
   - If `players[i] <= trainers[j]`, we have a valid match:
     - Move both pointers (`i++`, `j++`).
   - If not, trainer `j` can't satisfy player `i`:
     - Move trainer pointer (`j++`) to try the next trainer.
3. Count the number of successful matches.

This works because:
- Sorting helps us always try the **smallest possible trainer** that can match a player.
- Greedily assigning trainers ensures we save stronger trainers for more demanding players.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - `O(n log n + m log m)` for sorting, where `n = players.length`, `m = trainers.length`
  - `O(n + m)` for matching using two pointers  
  → Overall: **O(n log n + m log m)**

- **Space Complexity**:  
  - `O(1)` (in-place sorting if allowed, else `O(n + m)` for sorted arrays)

# Code

```ts
function matchPlayersAndTrainers(players: number[], trainers: number[]): number {
    players.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    trainers.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let i = 0, j = 0, matches = 0;

    while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
        if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
            matches++;
            i++;
            j++;
        } else {
            j++; // Trainer too weak, try next
        }
    }

    return matches;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:
```ts
players = [4, 7, 9]
trainers = [8, 2, 5, 8]
```

**Sorted**:
- players = [4, 7, 9]
- trainers = [2, 5, 8, 8]

**Matchings**:
- 4 → 5 
- 7 → 8 
- 9 → 8 (no more trainers left)

**Result**: 2 matches

### Constraints Justification

- With `n, m ≤ 10⁵`, the sorting approach is efficient and acceptable.
- The greedy method is optimal because matching weakest players first ensures maximum utilization of trainers.

---

### **Summary**

This problem reduces to a greedy resource allocation challenge. By:
- Sorting both arrays
- Using two pointers to greedily match smallest available pairs
We efficiently determine the **maximum number of valid matchings**.
