[2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii/)

### Problem Summary

You are given `n` rooms and a list of meetings as `[start, end)` intervals. You must **allocate rooms to meetings** using the following rules:
1. At the meeting's **start time**, assign the **lowest-numbered available room**.
2. If no room is free at that time, **delay the meeting** until the **earliest room becomes free**, and use that room.
3. The **duration** of the meeting stays the same even when delayed.
4. If multiple rooms are tied in the number of meetings held, return the **lowest-numbered room**.

---

# Intuition

This is a scheduling problem with dynamic resource assignment:

* We want to efficiently **track room availability** and assign them based on:
  * **Availability time**,
  * **Lowest room number** if tied.
  
* Use **two priority queues (min-heaps)**:
  * `freeRooms`: keeps available rooms, sorted by room number.
  * `busyRooms`: keeps ongoing meetings as `[endTime, room]`, sorted by `endTime`.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort meetings by start time**.
2. At each meeting’s start time:

   * **Free up rooms** whose meetings ended before the current time.
   * If a room is available in `freeRooms`, assign it.
   * If none, **delay the meeting** until the **earliest room frees**, and schedule it accordingly.
3. Track **number of meetings per room** using an array.
4. At the end, return the **room with the most meetings**, breaking ties with lowest index.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time: O(M log N)** where:
  * `M` = number of meetings
  * `N` = number of rooms
  * Each meeting triggers heap operations
  
* **Space: O(N + M)** for tracking room assignments and meeting info.

# Code

```ts
function mostBooked(n: number, meetings: number[][]): number {
    meetings.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const freeRooms: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) freeRooms.push(i);
    freeRooms.sort((a, b) => a - b); // ensure lowest room comes first

    const busyRooms: [number, number][] = []; // [endTime, roomNumber]
    const roomUsage = new Array(n).fill(0);

    let heapPush = (heap: [number, number][], val: [number, number]) => {
        heap.push(val);
        let i = heap.length - 1;
        while (i > 0) {
            let parent = Math.floor((i - 1) / 2);
            if (heap[parent][0] < heap[i][0] || (heap[parent][0] === heap[i][0] && heap[parent][1] < heap[i][1])) break;
            [heap[i], heap[parent]] = [heap[parent], heap[i]];
            i = parent;
        }
    };

    let heapPop = (heap: [number, number][]) => {
        const top = heap[0];
        const last = heap.pop()!;
        if (heap.length > 0) {
            heap[0] = last;
            let i = 0;
            while (true) {
                let left = 2 * i + 1, right = 2 * i + 2, smallest = i;
                if (left < heap.length && (heap[left][0] < heap[smallest][0] || (heap[left][0] === heap[smallest][0] && heap[left][1] < heap[smallest][1]))) {
                    smallest = left;
                }
                if (right < heap.length && (heap[right][0] < heap[smallest][0] || (heap[right][0] === heap[smallest][0] && heap[right][1] < heap[smallest][1]))) {
                    smallest = right;
                }
                if (smallest === i) break;
                [heap[i], heap[smallest]] = [heap[smallest], heap[i]];
                i = smallest;
            }
        }
        return top;
    };

    for (let [start, end] of meetings) {
        // Free up rooms
        while (busyRooms.length && busyRooms[0][0] <= start) {
            const [_, room] = heapPop(busyRooms);
            freeRooms.push(room);
        }

        freeRooms.sort((a, b) => a - b); // ensure room with lowest number is picked

        if (freeRooms.length > 0) {
            const room = freeRooms.shift()!;
            roomUsage[room]++;
            heapPush(busyRooms, [end, room]);
        } else {
            const [freeTime, room] = heapPop(busyRooms);
            const duration = end - start;
            const newEnd = freeTime + duration;
            roomUsage[room]++;
            heapPush(busyRooms, [newEnd, room]);
        }
    }

    let max = -1, res = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (roomUsage[i] > max) {
            max = roomUsage[i];
            res = i;
        }
    }
    return res;
};

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input:**

```ts
n = 2
meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
```

**Steps:**

1. Time 0 → Meeting 1 starts → Room 0 used
2. Time 1 → Meeting 2 starts → Room 1 used
3. Time 2/3 → Rooms full → Meeting 3 & 4 delayed
4. Time 5 → Room 1 frees → Meeting 3 starts → Room 1 (5–10)
5. Time 10 → Room 0 frees → Meeting 4 starts → Room 0 (10–11)

**Room Usage:** [2, 2] → Return **0** (lowest index with max usage)

---

### **Summary**

* Efficient room scheduling using **greedy with heaps**
* Adheres to complex conditions: **delayed meetings, room preference, earliest availability**
* Solves in **logarithmic time per meeting**, handling $10^5$ meetings comfortably.
