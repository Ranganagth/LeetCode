[1079. Letter Tile Possibilities](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-tile-possibilities/)

# Intuition

The task involves generating all possible non-empty sequences that can be created using the given tiles, considering that:
1. Letters can be repeated based on their frequency.
2. The order of letters matters (e.g., "AB" and "BA" are distinct).
3. Duplicate sequences should be avoided.

This is a permutation problem, and we can use **backtracking** to generate all possible combinations while keeping track of the frequency of each letter.

# Approach

1. **Frequency Counting**:
    - Use a frequency map or array to track how many times each letter appears in the input string.
	
2. **Backtracking**:
    - Generate sequences by trying to use each available letter.
    - Reduce the frequency of the chosen letter temporarily, and recursively attempt to extend the sequence.
    - Restore the frequency after the recursive call (backtrack).
	
3. **Base Case**:
    - Every time a sequence is formed (even partially), count it as a valid sequence.
	
4. **Avoid Duplicates**:
    - By iterating through the frequency map instead of the original string, duplicate sequences are naturally avoided.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Generating all subsequences involves exploring all permutations of the tiles, bounded by *O(k!)*, where kk is the length of the string.
    - In the worst case, *k = 7*, so ***O(7!) = 5040*** recursive calls.
	
- **Space Complexity**:
    - The recursion depth is ***O(k)***, where *k* is the length of the string.
    - Additional space is used for the frequency map, ***O(26)*** for uppercase English letters.

# Code

```typescript
function numTilePossibilities(tiles: string): number {
    const freq = new Map<string, number>();

    // Count the frequency of each letter
    for (const tile of tiles) {
        freq.set(tile, (freq.get(tile) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Backtracking function to generate sequences
    const backtrack = (): number => {
        let count = 0;

        for (const [letter, countRemaining] of freq.entries()) {
            if (countRemaining > 0) {
                // Use the current letter
                freq.set(letter, countRemaining - 1);

                // Count this sequence and extend further
                count += 1 + backtrack();

                // Backtrack: restore the letter's frequency
                freq.set(letter, countRemaining);
            }
        }

        return count;
    };

    return backtrack();
};

```

## **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
tiles = "AAB";
```

**Execution**:
5. Frequency map: `{ A: 2, B: 1 }`.
6. Backtracking:
    - Start with empty sequence.
    - Add "A" → Count subsequences: ["A"].
        - Add "A" again → ["AA"].
        - Add "B" → ["AAB"].
    - Backtrack and add "B" after the first "A" → ["AB"].
    - Backtrack to add "B" as the first letter → ["B"].
    - Add "A" → ["BA"].
    - Add "A" again → ["BAA"].
7. Total valid sequences: 8.

**Output**:

```typescript
numTilePossibilities("AAB"); // 8
```

### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
tiles = "AAABBC";
```

**Execution**:
8. Frequency map: `{ A: 3, B: 2, C: 1 }`.
9. Backtracking generates all valid sequences, avoiding duplicates by using the frequency map.
10. Total valid sequences: 188.

**Output**:

```typescript
numTilePossibilities("AAABBC"); // 188
```

### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
tiles = "V";
```

**Execution**:
11. Frequency map: `{ V: 1 }`.
12. Only one possible sequence: ["V"].

**Output**:

```typescript
numTilePossibilities("V"); // 1
```

## **Edge Cases**

13. **Single Letter**
    - Input: `"X"`
    - Output: `1` (only one sequence: `"X"`).
14. **All Identical Letters**:
    - Input: `"AAA"`
    - Output: `3` (sequences: `"A"`, `"AA"`, `"AAA"`).
	
15. **Maximum Input Length**:
    - Input: A string of 7 distinct letters (e.g., `"ABCDEFG"`).
    - Output: 2⁷ - 1 = 127 (all non-empty subsequences).
