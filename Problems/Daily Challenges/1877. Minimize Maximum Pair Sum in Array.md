[1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/)

# Intuition

We want to **pair numbers so that the largest pair sum is as small as possible**.

A key greedy insight:

* Large numbers should be paired with **small numbers**, not with other large ones.
* If two large numbers are paired together, they create a very large sum and dominate the maximum.

This is a classic **minimize the maximum** pairing problem.

## Greedy Strategy (Why It Works)

1. **Sort the array**
2. Pair:

   * Smallest with largest
   * Second smallest with second largest
   * And so on

This balances each pair and prevents any single pair from becoming too large.

This greedy strategy is **provably optimal**.

# Approach

1. Sort `nums` in ascending order
2. Initialize `maxSum = 0`
3. Use two pointers:

   * `left = 0`
   * `right = n - 1`
4. While `left < right`:

   * Compute `nums[left] + nums[right]`
   * Update `maxSum`
   * Move pointers inward
5. Return `maxSum`

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n log n)` (sorting dominates)
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra (in-place sort)

---

# Code

```ts
function minPairSum(nums: number[]): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    let maxSum = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, nums[left] + nums[right]);
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

# Example Walkthrough

## Example 1

```
nums = [3,5,2,3]
```

After sorting:

```
[2,3,3,5]
```

Pairs:

* (2,5) → 7
* (3,3) → 6

Maximum pair sum = **7**

## Example 2

```
nums = [3,5,4,2,4,6]
```

After sorting:

```
[2,3,4,4,5,6]
```

Pairs:

* (2,6) → 8
* (3,5) → 8
* (4,4) → 8

Maximum pair sum = **8**

---

## Final Insight

This is a **pure greedy + sorting** problem.

Pairing smallest with largest minimizes the worst-case pair sum, which is exactly what the problem asks for.
