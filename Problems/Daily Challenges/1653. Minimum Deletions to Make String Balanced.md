[1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/)

# Intuition

To make a string consisting of 'a' and 'b' balanced, we need to ensure that there are no 'b' characters before any 'a' characters. This means all 'a's should appear before all 'b's. The optimal way to achieve this with the minimum number of deletions is to track the count of 'a' and 'b' characters and determine the deletions required to ensure that all 'a's appear before all 'b's.

# Approach

1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. Maintain a count of 'a' and 'b' characters encountered so far.
3. For each character:
   - If it's 'b', increment the 'b' count.
   - If it's 'a', consider two options:
     - Delete this 'a' to maintain the current sequence of 'b's followed by 'a's. This means incrementing the `delete_a` count.
     - Delete all previous 'b's to make room for this 'a', which would mean the current number of 'b's encountered so far.
4. Keep track of the minimum deletions required at each step.
5. The result will be the minimum deletions needed to make the string balanced.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** because we only need to traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function minDeletionsToBalance(s: string): number {
    let count_a = 0;
    let count_b = 0;
    let deletions = 0;

    for (const char of s) {
        if (char === 'a') {
            count_a++;
        } else {
            count_b++;
        }
        deletions = Math.min(deletions + (char === 'a' ? 1 : 0), count_b);
    }

    return deletions;
};

```

## Example usage

```Typescript
console.log(minDeletionsToBalance("aababbab")); // Output: 2
console.log(minDeletionsToBalance("bbaaaaabb")); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `count_a` keeps track of the number of 'a' characters encountered.
   - `count_b` keeps track of the number of 'b' characters encountered.
   - `deletions` keeps track of the minimum deletions needed to maintain the balance.

2. **Traversal**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - If it's 'a', increment `count_a`.
     - If it's 'b', increment `count_b`.
     - Update the `deletions` to the minimum of the current `deletions` incremented by 1 (if the current character is 'a') and `count_b` (which would mean deleting all previous 'b's to make space for this 'a').

3. **Result**:
   - The final value of `deletions` is the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.
