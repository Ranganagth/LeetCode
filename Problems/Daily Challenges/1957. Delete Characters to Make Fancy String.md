[1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/)

# Intuition

A **fancy string** is defined as a string that **does not contain three or more consecutive identical characters**.
So the goal is simple:

> **Remove the fewest characters** from the given string such that no three consecutive characters are the same.

---

# Approach

1. We'll iterate through each character of the string.
2. For each character, we **keep track of how many times the current character has repeated consecutively**.
3. If a character repeats **less than 3 times**, we **include it in the result**.
4. If it repeats **3 or more times**, we **skip it** (i.e., do not add it to the result).
5. At the end, we return the final string built from allowed characters.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  We iterate over the string once.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  We use an array to build the result string.

# Code

```typescript
function makeFancyString(s: string): string {
    const result: string[] = [];
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (i === 0 || s[i] !== s[i - 1]) {
            count = 1;  // reset count for new character
        } else {
            count++;   // increment count if same as previous
        }

        if (count < 3) {
            result.push(s[i]);  // only push if count is less than 3
        }
    }

    return result.join('');
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

Input: `s = "leeetcode"`

Step-by-step:

```
l: count = 1 -> keep => result: "l"
e: count = 1 -> keep => result: "le"
e: count = 2 -> keep => result: "lee"
e: count = 3 -> skip (too many e's)
t: new char -> count = 1 => result: "leet"
c: new char -> count = 1 => result: "leetc"
o: new char -> count = 1 => result: "leetco"
d: new char -> count = 1 => result: "leetcod"
e: new char -> count = 1 => result: "leetcode"
```

**Output:** `"leetcode"`

---

#### Example 2:

Input: `s = "aaabaaaa"`

Step-by-step:

```
a: count = 1 -> keep => "a"
a: count = 2 -> keep => "aa"
a: count = 3 -> skip
b: new char -> count = 1 => "aab"
a: new char -> count = 1 => "aaba"
a: count = 2 -> keep => "aabaa"
a: count = 3 -> skip
```

**Output:** `"aabaa"`

---

#### Example 3:

Input: `s = "aab"`

No three consecutive characters -> return as-is.
**Output:** `"aab"`
