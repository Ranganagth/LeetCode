[1900. The Earliest and Latest Rounds Where Players Compete](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-earliest-and-latest-rounds-where-players-compete/)

# Intuition

In this tournament, two players `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are unbeatable — they will beat anyone unless they face each other. 

The goal is to find:
- **Earliest round** where they *must* face each other.
- **Latest round** where they *can* avoid each other as long as possible.

---

# Key Observations

1. **Matchups per round**: Player `i` faces player `n - i + 1`. So, the 1st and last players face off, and so on.
2. Players advancing to the next round are sorted **by their original number**, not by who they beat.
3. When `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are symmetric (i.e., `i` vs `n - i + 1`), they meet **that round**.
4. We simulate rounds and track how `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` move closer or eventually meet.

### Strategy

- **Earliest Round**: Simulate rounds assuming both players win, and stop as soon as they would face each other.
- **Latest Round**: Simulate rounds making sure both avoid each other as long as possible.

This is feasible since `n ≤ 28`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time:** `O(2^n)` in worst case due to branching, but pruned heavily using memoization.
- **Space:** `O(n * 2^n)` in worst case for memoization and recursive stack.

# Code

```ts
function earliestAndLatest(n: number, firstPlayer: number, secondPlayer: number): number[] {
    const memo = new Map<string, [number, number]>();

    function dfs(players: number[], round: number): [number, number] {
        const key = players.join(",");
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key)!;

        let i = 0, j = players.length - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            const a = players[i], b = players[j];
            if ((a === firstPlayer && b === secondPlayer) || (a === secondPlayer && b === firstPlayer)) {
                return [round, round];
            }
            i++; j--;
        }

        const nextSet = new Set<string>();

        function backtrack(i: number, j: number, next: number[]) {
            if (i >= j) {
                if (i === j) next.push(players[i]); // odd player out
                nextSet.add(next.slice().sort((a, b) => a - b).join(","));
                if (i === j) next.pop();
                return;
            }

            const a = players[i], b = players[j];
            const winners = [];

            if (a === firstPlayer || a === secondPlayer) {
                winners.push(a);
            } else if (b === firstPlayer || b === secondPlayer) {
                winners.push(b);
            } else {
                winners.push(a, b);
            }

            for (const w of winners) {
                next.push(w);
                backtrack(i + 1, j - 1, next);
                next.pop();
            }
        }

        backtrack(0, players.length - 1, []);

        let minRound = Infinity, maxRound = -Infinity;
        for (const s of nextSet) {
            const nextPlayers = s.split(',').map(Number);
            const [minR, maxR] = dfs(nextPlayers, round + 1);
            minRound = Math.min(minRound, minR);
            maxRound = Math.max(maxRound, maxR);
        }

        memo.set(key, [minRound, maxRound]);
        return [minRound, maxRound];
    }

    const players = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i + 1);
    return dfs(players, 1);
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:
```ts
n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4
```
- Round 1: 1 vs 11, 2 vs 10, 3 vs 9, 4 vs 8, 5 vs 7, 6 auto advances
- Players 2 and 4 win → Advance
- Eventually they face each other in:
  - **Earliest** round: 3 (if always on collision course)
  - **Latest** round: 4 (if maximally avoid each other)

**Result:** `[3, 4]`

---

### Constraints Justify Approach

- With `n ≤ 28`, this recursive + memoization method is practical and efficient.

### **Summary**

This problem is a combination of:
- Tournament simulation
- Game theory (simulate best/worst scenarios)
- Pruned DFS + memoization
