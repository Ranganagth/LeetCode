[3375. Minimum Operations to Make Array Values Equal to K](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-array-values-equal-to-k/)

# Intuition

To reduce all elements of the array `nums` to the target value `k`, we are allowed to **choose a valid integer `h`**, and set all `nums[i] > h` to `h`. A valid `h` is one such that **all values strictly greater than `h` are the same**.

The key idea is to **reduce the larger values step-by-step**, using only **valid reductions**, until all values equal `k`.

To solve this optimally:

- We process unique values **from high to low**.
- Each time we move to a smaller distinct value, if the previously higher values were the same, it is a valid reduction step.
- We keep count of such reductions until we reach `k`.    

# Approach

1. **Sort the array in ascending order**.
2. If the smallest number is **less than `k`**, return `-1`, because we are not allowed to increase values.
3. Traverse the sorted array from start to end:
    - For each **distinct value greater than `k`**, increment a counter.
    - Skip over repeated values to avoid redundant counting.        
4. Return the number of valid operations required to reach `k`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` for sorting the array
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` extra space (ignoring sorting space)

# Code

```ts
function minOperations(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // If any number is less than k, it's impossible
    if (nums[0] < k) return -1;

    let count = 0;
    let n = nums.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] <= k) continue;

        // Skip all duplicates of the current number
        while (i + 1 < n && nums[i] === nums[i + 1]) {
            i++;
        }

        // Each group of identical numbers > k contributes one operation
        count++;
    }

    return count;
};

```

## **Example Walkthroughs**

### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: nums = [5, 2, 5, 4, 5], k = 2
```

Sorted: [2, 4, 5, 5, 5]

- All elements >= k 
- Group 5 → operation 1: reduce 5 to 4
- Group 4 → operation 2: reduce 4 to 2
- All elements become 2 → success    

**Output**: `2`

### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: nums = [2, 1, 2], k = 2
```

Sorted: [1, 2, 2]

- Minimum is 1 < k → cannot increase it → not allowed

**Output**: `-1`

### **Example 3**

```ts
Input: nums = [9, 7, 5, 3], k = 1
```

Sorted: [3, 5, 7, 9]

- Valid reductions: 9 → 7 → 5 → 3 → 1
- 4 distinct reductions needed

**Output**: `4`

## **Summary**

This greedy approach processes values top-down and ensures that every reduction step is valid. Sorting helps identify distinct values and ensures minimal operations are used. The edge condition ensures we return `-1` if increasing is ever needed.
