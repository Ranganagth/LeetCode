[786. K-th Smallest Prime Fraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-smallest-prime-fraction/)

# Intuition
To find the kth smallest fraction, we can use a binary search approach. We can first assume the range of possible fractions, i.e., `[0, 1]`, and then perform binary search to find the fraction with `k` smallest elements between 0 and 1.

# Approach
1. We start with a binary search range `[0, 1]`.
2. At each step of the binary search, we find the middle fraction (let's call it `m`), which is the mid of the current range.
3. We count the number of fractions in the array `arr` that are less than or equal to `m`.
4. If the count is less than `k`, we update the lower bound of the range to `m`, otherwise, we update the upper bound of the range to `m`.
5. We repeat the binary search until the range becomes sufficiently small (e.g., the difference between upper and lower bounds is less than a certain threshold).
6. The fraction corresponding to the lower bound of the final range is the kth smallest fraction.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: ***O(n log(max - min))***, where `n` is the length of the array `arr` and `max - min` is the range of possible fractions (max and min are the maximum and minimum values in `arr`).
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***.

# Code

```typescript
function kthSmallestPrimeFraction(arr: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const n = arr.length;
    let left = 0;
    let right = 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = (left + right) / 2;
        let count = 0;
        let maxFraction = 0;

        for (let i = 0, j = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            while (j < n && arr[i] > mid * arr[j]) j++;
            count += n - j;

            if (j < n) {
                const fraction = arr[i] / arr[j];
                if (fraction > maxFraction) {
                    maxFraction = fraction;
                }
            }
        }

        if (count === k) {
            return findFraction(arr, mid);
        } else if (count < k) {
            left = mid;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return findFraction(arr, left);

    function findFraction(arr: number[], target: number): number[] {
        let maxFraction = 0;
        let numerator = 0;
        let denominator = 0;

        for (let i = 0, j = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            while (j < n && arr[i] > target * arr[j]) j++;

            if (j < n) {
                const fraction = arr[i] / arr[j];
                if (fraction > maxFraction) {
                    maxFraction = fraction;
                    numerator = arr[i];
                    denominator = arr[j];
                }
            }
        }

        return [numerator, denominator];
    }
};

> This solution finds the kth smallest prime fraction using a binary search approach. It performs binary search on the range of possible fractions and counts the number of fractions less than or equal to the middle fraction (`m`). Based on the count, it updates the range and continues the binary search until the range becomes sufficiently small. Finally, it returns the kth smallest fraction.
