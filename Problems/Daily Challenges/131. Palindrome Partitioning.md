[131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

# Intuition
The idea is to use recursion to generate all possible partitions. At each step, we consider a prefix of the string and check if it's a palindrome. If it is, we recursively partition the remaining part of the string. This process continues until we've considered the entire string.

# Approach
1. **Backtracking**: Start with an empty partition and try to partition the string at different positions.
2. **Palindrome Check**: Before adding a substring to the current partition, check if it is a palindrome.
3. **Recursive Exploration**: If the prefix is a palindrome, recursively partition the rest of the string.
4. **Base Case**: When the entire string has been partitioned, add the current partition to the list of results.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n ⋅ 2ⁿ)***, where `n` is the length of the string. There are `2ⁿ` possible partitions, and checking each partition takes `O(n)` time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the recursion stack, where `n` is the length of the string.

# Code
```typescript
function partition(s: string): string[][] {
    const result: string[][] = [];
    
    const isPalindrome = (str: string, left: number, right: number): boolean => {
        while (left < right) {
            if (str[left] !== str[right]) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    };

    const backtrack = (start: number, currentPartition: string[]) => {
        if (start === s.length) {
            result.push([...currentPartition]);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let end = start; end < s.length; end++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, end)) {
                currentPartition.push(s.substring(start, end + 1));
                backtrack(end + 1, currentPartition);
                currentPartition.pop();
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack(0, []);
    
    return result;
};

```

# Explanation
1. **Helper Function `isPalindrome`**:
   - Takes a string `str`, a starting index `left`, and an ending index `right`.
   - Checks if the substring `str[left:right+1]` is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.

2. **Backtracking Function `backtrack`**:
   - Takes a starting index `start` and the current partition `currentPartition`.
   - If `start` equals the length of the string `s`, it means we have considered the entire string, so we add the current partition to `result`.
   - Otherwise, iterate from `start` to the end of the string. For each position `end`, check if the substring `s[start:end+1]` is a palindrome.
   - If it is, add the substring to `currentPartition`, recursively call `backtrack` with `end + 1`, and then backtrack by removing the last added substring.

3. **Initial Call**: The recursion starts with the starting index `0` and an empty partition.
