[1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-increasing-frequency/)

# Intuition
The problem involves sorting elements of an array based on their frequency and, in the case of ties, sorting by their values in decreasing order. This requires a two-step sorting process where we first count the frequencies of the elements and then sort based on the defined criteria.

# Approach
1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a hash map to count the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Sort Elements**: Sort the elements first by frequency in increasing order. For elements with the same frequency, sort by value in decreasing order.
3. **Reconstruct Array**: Build the sorted array based on the sorted list of elements and their frequencies.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)***, primarily due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the frequency map and the sorted array.

# Code 

```typescript
function frequencySort(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const freqMap: Map<number, number> = new Map();

    for (const num of nums) {
        freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return nums.sort((a, b) => {
        const freqA = freqMap.get(a)!;
        const freqB = freqMap.get(b)!;
        if (freqA === freqB) {
            return b - a;
        }
        return freqA - freqB;
    });
};

```

## Example usage:
```typescript
const nums1 = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3];
console.log(frequencySort(nums1)); // Output: [3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

const nums2 = [2, 3, 1, 3, 2];
console.log(frequencySort(nums2)); // Output: [1, 3, 3, 2, 2]

const nums3 = [-1, 1, -6, 4, 5, -6, 1, 4, 1];
console.log(frequencySort(nums3)); // Output: [5, -1, 4, 4, -6, -6, 1, 1, 1]
```

### Explanation
1. **Frequency Counting**:
   ```typescript
   for (const num of nums) {
       freqMap.set(num, (freqMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
   }
   ```
   This loop populates the `freqMap` with the count of each number in the `nums` array.

2. **Sorting**:
   ```typescript
   return nums.sort((a, b) => {
       const freqA = freqMap.get(a)!;
       const freqB = freqMap.get(b)!;
       if (freqA === freqB) {
           return b - a; // If frequencies are the same, sort by value in decreasing order
       }
       return freqA - freqB; // Otherwise, sort by frequency in increasing order
   });
   ```
   The `sort` function sorts the array first by frequency in ascending order. If two numbers have the same frequency, it sorts them by their values in descending order.
