[2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph/)

# Intuition
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **Ancestors Collection**: Use a DFS traversal to find all reachable nodes from each starting node, which represents the ancestors of the destination node.
3. **Sort Ancestors**: After collecting ancestors for each node, sort them in ascending order to meet the problem's requirement.

# Approach
1. **Graph Construction**: Create an adjacency list from the input edge list.
2. **Ancestors Set**: Use a set to keep track of ancestors for each node during the traversal to avoid duplicates.
3. **DFS Traversal**: For each node, perform a DFS to find all reachable nodes and update the ancestors for those nodes.
4. **Result Preparation**: Convert sets to lists and sort them to prepare the final result.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + E + n² log n)***, where *n* is the number of nodes, *E* is the number of edges, and *n² log n* accounts for sorting the ancestors for each node.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n + E)*** for storing the graph and ancestors.

# Code

```typescript
function getAncestors(n: number, edges: number[][]): number[][] {
    const graph: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    for (const [from, to] of edges) {
        graph[from].push(to);
    }

    const ancestors: Set<number>[] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => new Set<number>());

    function dfs(node: number, start: number) {
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (!ancestors[neighbor].has(start)) {
                ancestors[neighbor].add(start);
                dfs(neighbor, start);
            }
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dfs(i, i);
    }

    const result: number[][] = ancestors.map(ancestorSet => Array.from(ancestorSet).sort((a, b) => a - b));
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Representation**: The adjacency list is built from the input edges.
2. **Ancestors Collection**: For each node, a DFS is used to traverse all reachable nodes, updating the ancestors set for each visited node.
3. **Result Preparation**: Ancestors sets are converted to sorted arrays for the final output.
