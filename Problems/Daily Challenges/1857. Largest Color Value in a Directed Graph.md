[1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-color-value-in-a-directed-graph/)

### **Title**

# Intuition

We're asked to find the maximum frequency of any color along a **valid path** in a **directed graph**.
If the graph contains a **cycle**, there's no valid path that ends, so we must return `-1`.

If the graph is a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**:
* Perform a **topological sort** to process nodes in a valid order.
* At each node, **propagate color frequencies** to its neighbors.
* Track the **maximum color frequency** at each node using a 2D array (node × 26 colors).

# Approach

1. **Build graph and in-degree array**:
   * Use adjacency list for outgoing edges.
   * Count in-degrees to find source nodes.

2. **Initialize frequency tracking**:
   * Create a 2D array `count[n][26]` where `count[i][c]` represents the maximum count of color `c` from any path ending at node `i`.

3. **Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)**:
   * Add nodes with `inDegree = 0` to queue.
   * For each node `u`:
     * Increment its own color count `count[u][color]++`.
     * For each neighbor `v`:
	       * Update each color count for `v` using `max(count[v][c], count[u][c])`
	       * Decrease in-degree of `v`
	       * If in-degree of `v` becomes 0, add it to the queue.

4. **Detect cycle**:
   * If not all nodes are processed, the graph has a cycle — return `-1`.

5. **Track max color value**:
   * Keep track of the maximum color count seen across all nodes during processing.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m + 26 * n)`

  * `O(n + m)` for building and traversing the graph.
  * `O(26 * n)` for color count updates.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n + m + 26 * n)`

# Code

```ts
function largestPathValue(colors: string, edges: number[][]): number {
    const n = colors.length;
    const graph: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const inDegree: number[] = Array(n).fill(0);

    // Build the graph
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        inDegree[v]++;
    }

    // 2D array to store color frequencies for each node
    const count: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(26).fill(0));
    const queue: number[] = [];

    // Initialize queue with zero in-degree nodes
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (inDegree[i] === 0) queue.push(i);
    }

    let visited = 0;
    let maxColorValue = 0;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const u = queue.shift()!;
        visited++;

        const colorIndex = colors.charCodeAt(u) - 97;
        count[u][colorIndex]++;
        maxColorValue = Math.max(maxColorValue, count[u][colorIndex]);

        for (const v of graph[u]) {
            for (let c = 0; c < 26; c++) {
                count[v][c] = Math.max(count[v][c], count[u][c]);
            }
            inDegree[v]--;
            if (inDegree[v] === 0) {
                queue.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    return visited === n ? maxColorValue : -1;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
```

* Graph:

  ```
  0(a) → 1(b)
    ↓
    2(a) → 3(c) → 4(a)
  ```

* Valid path: `0 → 2 → 3 → 4`

  * Colors: a → a → c → a
  * Color frequency: a = 3, c = 1 → max = **3**

**Output: 3**

#### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]
```

* A self-loop → **cycle** → no valid path

**Output: -1**

### **Summary**

This method combines **graph theory (topological sort)** with **dynamic programming (color frequency propagation)** to find the optimal path in a DAG while detecting cycles efficiently.
