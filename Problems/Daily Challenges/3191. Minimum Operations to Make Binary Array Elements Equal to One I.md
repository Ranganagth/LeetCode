[3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-binary-array-elements-equal-to-one-i/)

# Intuition

We need to make all elements in `nums` equal to `1` by **flipping consecutive triplets** (three adjacent elements). The key observations are:

1. **Flipping a triplet flips all three bits**, changing `0s` to `1s` and vice versa.
2. **If the number of `0s` in the array is odd and the array size is not a multiple of 3, making all `1s` is impossible.**
3. **A greedy approach works efficiently**—we try to flip from left to right whenever we encounter a `0`, ensuring minimal operations.

# Approach: Greedy Strategy

### **Step 1: Traverse the Array**

- Iterate through `nums` from left to right.
- If we find a `0`, we must flip it to `1`.
- The only way to do this is by flipping a **triplet starting from this index**.

### **Step 2: Flip Triplets**

- If `nums[i] == 0`, flip the triplet at index `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.
- If `i+2` is out of bounds (i.e., we don't have 3 elements left to flip), return `-1` since it's impossible to flip it.
- Keep track of the number of flips.

### **Step 3: Return Minimum Flips**

- If all elements become `1`, return the count of operations.
- If not, return `-1`.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** since we traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** **O(1)** as we modify the array in place.

# Code

```typescript
function minOperations(nums: number[]): number {
    let n = nums.length;
    let operations = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i <= n - 3; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 0) {
            // Flip nums[i], nums[i+1], nums[i+2]
            nums[i] ^= 1;
            nums[i + 1] ^= 1;
            nums[i + 2] ^= 1;
            operations++;
        }
    }

    // If there's any remaining zero, it's impossible
    return nums.includes(0) ? -1 : operations;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input:**

```typescript
nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0]
```

#### **Step-by-step Execution:**

1. **Flip at `i=0`** → `[1,0,0,1,0,0]`
2. **Flip at `i=1`** → `[1,1,1,0,0,0]`
3. **Flip at `i=3`** → `[1,1,1,1,1,1]` All `1s`.

#### **Output:**

```typescript
3
```

### **Example 2**

#### **Input:**

```typescript
nums = [0,1,1,1]
```

#### **Step-by-step Execution:**

1. The last `0` at index `0` cannot be flipped because we need 3 elements.
2. **Impossible to convert all to `1`**.

#### **Output:**

```typescript
-1
```

## **Why This Approach Works Well?**

**Greedy ensures minimal operations**  
**Linear time complexity (O(n))** is optimal for large inputs (`10⁵`).  
**In-place modification avoids extra space usage**
