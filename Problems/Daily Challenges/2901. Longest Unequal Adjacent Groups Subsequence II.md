[2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii/)

# Intuition

We need to find the longest subsequence from the `words` array where:
1. The `groups` of consecutive elements in the subsequence are different.
2. The words have the same length and differ by exactly one character (Hamming Distance = 1).

This is a classic case of building the longest path in a directed graph where:
* Each node represents a word.
* An edge exists between two nodes if:
  * They belong to different groups.
  * They differ by exactly one character.

# Approach

1. **Preprocessing:**
   * Initialize two arrays:
     * `longestSubSeqLength`: Stores the longest path length ending at each word.
     * `prevWordIndex`: Stores the previous word's index for path reconstruction.

2. **Check for Hamming Distance:**
   * Use a helper function `checkOneCharDiff` to determine if two words differ by exactly one character.

3. **Dynamic Programming and Graph Traversal:**
   * For each word at index `i`, compare it with all previous words at index `j`.
   * If the words belong to different groups and differ by one character:
     * Update the path length for `i`.
     * Track the previous word that led to this maximum path.

4. **Reconstruct the Path:**
   * Start from the word with the maximum path length.
   * Trace back using `prevWordIndex` to reconstruct the subsequence.
   * Since the path is traced backward, reverse it at the end.

5. **Output the Resulting Subsequence.**

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2 * L)`, where:
  * `n` is the number of words.
  * `L` is the average length of the words (10 in the worst case).
  * We check each word against every previous word and compute Hamming distance.

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` — For `longestSubSeqLength`, `prevWordIndex`, and the final subsequence.

Given the constraints (`n <= 1000` and `L <= 10`), this solution is efficient.

# Code

```typescript
// Checks if two strings differ by exactly one character. 
const checkOneCharDiff = (s: string, t: string): boolean => {
  if (s.length !== t.length) {
    return false;
  }

  let diffCount: number = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; ++i) {
    if (s[i] !== t[i]) {
      diffCount++;
      if (diffCount > 1) return false;
    }
  }

  return diffCount === 1;
};

// Gets the longest subsequence of words following the specific rules.
function getWordsInLongestSubsequence(words: string[], groups: number[]): string[] {
  const n = words.length;
  
  // Initialize the longest subsequence length array with 1 for each word.
  const longestSubSeqLength: number[] = Array(n).fill(1);
  // Array to track the previous word in the sequence for each word.
  const prevWordIndex: number[] = Array(n).fill(-1);
  let maxSequenceLength: number = 1; // Length of the maximum subsequence found.
  let endIndex: number = 0; // To track the end of the longest subsequence.

  // Building up the longest subsequence length and previous word for each word
  for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (let j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
      if (groups[i] !== groups[j] && 
          checkOneCharDiff(words[i], words[j]) && 
          longestSubSeqLength[i] < longestSubSeqLength[j] + 1) {
        longestSubSeqLength[i] = longestSubSeqLength[j] + 1;
        prevWordIndex[i] = j;

        // Update maximum path length and its ending index
        if (longestSubSeqLength[i] > maxSequenceLength) {
          maxSequenceLength = longestSubSeqLength[i];
          endIndex = i;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Reconstruct the longest subsequence
  const longestSubsequence: string[] = [];
  for (let i = endIndex; i !== -1; i = prevWordIndex[i]) {
    longestSubsequence.push(words[i]);
  }

  // The words are pushed in reverse order, so we need to reverse the array before returning.
  return longestSubsequence.reverse();
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1**

```
Input: 
words = ["bab","dab","cab"]
groups = [1,2,2]

Step-by-step:
1. Compare "bab" and "dab":
   - Different groups (1, 2) and Hamming distance = 1 → Valid
   - Subsequence becomes: ["bab", "dab"]

2. Compare "bab" and "cab":
   - Different groups (1, 2) and Hamming distance = 1 → Valid
   - Subsequence becomes: ["bab", "cab"]

3. The longest valid subsequence is ["bab", "cab"].

Output: ["bab", "cab"]
```

#### **Example 2**

```
Input: 
words = ["a","b","c","d"]
groups = [1,2,3,4]

Step-by-step:
1. "a" -> "b" -> "c" -> "d" 
   - Different groups and Hamming distance = 1 for each step.
   - Subsequence becomes: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

Output: ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

### **Edge Cases Handled:**

1. If there are no different groups or no valid Hamming distance of 1, the longest subsequence is just the first word.
2. If all groups are different and all Hamming distances are 1, all words are included.
