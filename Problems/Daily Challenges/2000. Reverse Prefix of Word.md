[Reverse Prefix of Word - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-prefix-of-word/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-01)
# Problem Statement Breakdown
Given a string `word` and a character `ch`, we need to reverse the segment of `word` that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, we should do nothing.

### Examples:
- For `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, the output is `"dcbaefd"`.
  - The first occurrence of `"d"` is at index 3.
  - Reversing the segment from index 0 to 3 (inclusive), we get `"dcbaefd"`.
- For `word = "xyxzxe"` and `ch = "z"`, the output is `"zxyxxe"`.
  - The first and only occurrence of `"z"` is at index 3.
  - Reversing the segment from index 0 to 3 (inclusive), we get `"zxyxxe"`.
- For `word = "abcd"` and `ch = "z"`, the output is `"abcd"`.
  - `"z"` does not exist in `word`.
  - So, we should not do any reverse operation, and the resulting string is `"abcd"`.

### Constraints:
- The length of the string `word` is between `1` and `250`.
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `ch` is a lowercase English letter.

# Approach
1. Find the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `word`.
2. If `ch` exists in `word`:
   - Reverse the segment from index 0 to the index of the first occurrence of `ch` (inclusive).
3. Return the resulting string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string `word`.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the string `word`.

# Code

```typescript
function reversePrefix(word: string, ch: string): string {
    const index = word.indexOf(ch);
    if (index !== -1) {
        const reversedSegment = word.slice(0, index + 1).split('').reverse().join('');
        return reversedSegment + word.slice(index + 1);
    }
    return word;
};
```
