[3355. Zero Array Transformation I](https://leetcode.com/problems/zero-array-transformation-i/)

# Intuition

Each query `[l, r]` allows us to **decrease** any subset of numbers between indices `l` and `r` by 1. So, at most, we can decrement each index within that range by **1 per query**.

To determine whether it's possible to reduce the array `nums` to **all zeroes**, we need to check whether **the total number of times each index is covered by any query is at least equal to the value at that index**.

This is a perfect use case for a **difference array** (prefix sum approach), where we can efficiently count how many times each index is covered across all queries.

# Approach

1. Initialize a difference array `diff` of size `n + 1` (to handle range increments efficiently).
2. For each query `[l, r]`, increment `diff[l]` by 1 and decrement `diff[r + 1]` by 1.
3. Compute the prefix sum over `diff` to find how many times each index `i` was covered by queries.
4. For each index `i`, if `nums[i] > coverage[i]`, it means we do **not** have enough operations to bring `nums[i]` down to zero → return `false`.
5. If all elements satisfy this, return `true`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + q)` where:
  * `n` is the length of the `nums` array
  * `q` is the number of queries

* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the difference array and prefix sum array

# Code

```typescript
function isZeroArray(nums: number[], queries: number[][]): boolean {
  const n = nums.length;
  const diff: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

  // Apply range increment logic using difference array
  for (const [l, r] of queries) {
    diff[l] += 1;
    if (r + 1 < n) {
      diff[r + 1] -= 1;
    }
  }

  // Calculate the prefix sum to get how many times each index is covered
  const coverage: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);
  coverage[0] = diff[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    coverage[i] = coverage[i - 1] + diff[i];
  }

  // Check if each nums[i] can be reduced to 0
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (nums[i] > coverage[i]) return false;
  }

  return true;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1, 0, 1], queries = [[0, 2]]

Step 1: Apply query [0, 2]:
  diff = [1, 0, 0, -1]

Step 2: Compute coverage:
  coverage[0] = 1
  coverage[1] = 1
  coverage[2] = 1

Step 3: Check nums[i] <= coverage[i]:
  nums = [1, 0, 1]
  coverage = [1, 1, 1]
  All pass → return true
```

#### **Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 1], queries = [[1, 3], [0, 2]]

Step 1: Apply both queries:
  After [1, 3]: diff = [0, 1, 0, 0, -1]
  After [0, 2]: diff = [1, 1, 0, -1, -1]

Step 2: Compute coverage:
  coverage[0] = 1
  coverage[1] = 2
  coverage[2] = 2
  coverage[3] = 1

Step 3: Check nums[i] <= coverage[i]:
  nums =     [4, 3, 2, 1]
  coverage = [1, 2, 2, 1]
  nums[0] > coverage[0] → return false
```

### **Edge Cases Covered:**

* **nums already all zeros:** Always return `true`.
* **Empty queries:** Only return `true` if all `nums[i] == 0`.
* **Large values in `nums` with few/no queries:** Return `false`.
