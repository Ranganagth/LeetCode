[1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-money-in-leetcode-bank/)

# Intuition

Hercy saves money in a *weekly pattern*:

* On **Monday of week 1**, he puts `$1`
* On **Tuesday of week 1**, he puts `$2`
* ...
* On **Sunday of week 1**, he puts `$7`

Then, the **next Monday** he starts from `$2` instead of `$1`, and again increases by `$1` each day.

So, every week:

* The **starting amount** increases by 1 from the previous week.
* Each week has **7 days** (except possibly the last partial week).

---

### Example Pattern

| Week | Monday Start | Deposits per Day    | Total of Week |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | 1            | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | 28            |
| 2    | 2            | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 | 35            |
| 3    | 3            | 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 42            |

Notice:

* The total of week `k` = sum of 7 consecutive numbers starting from `k`.
* So: `sum = 7*k + 21` (because the sum of first 7 natural numbers is 28, and difference = 7*(k-1)).

---

# Approach

1. Find how many **complete weeks** are there:
   `weeks = Math.floor(n / 7)`

2. Find **remaining days**:
   `days = n % 7`

3. Compute:

   * **Sum of full weeks**:

     * Week `i` (starting at i = 0 for week 1) contributes:
       `(start = 1 + i)`
       `sum_week = 7 * start + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)` = `7 * start + 21`
   * Sum over all full weeks.

4. **Add partial week** (remaining days of last week):

   * Start value for that week = `1 + weeks`
   * For each remaining day `d` from `0` to `days-1`, add `start + d`

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** O(1) — since we use only simple arithmetic
* **Space:** O(1)

---

# Code

```typescript
function totalMoney(n: number): number {
  const weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);
  const days = n % 7;

  // Sum for complete weeks
  // Each week contributes: (28 + 7*(weekIndex))
  const fullWeeksSum = (weeks * 28) + (7 * (weeks * (weeks - 1)) / 2);

  // Sum for remaining days
  const start = 1 + weeks;
  const remainingDaysSum = (days * (2 * start + (days - 1))) / 2; // arithmetic sum

  return fullWeeksSum + remainingDaysSum;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
n = 4
```

* `weeks = 0`
* `days = 4`
* `fullWeeksSum = 0`
* `start = 1`
* `remainingDaysSum = (4 * (2*1 + (4 - 1))) / 2 = (4 * 5) / 2 = 10`

Output = **10**

### Example 2

```
n = 10
```

* `weeks = 1`
* `days = 3`
* `fullWeeksSum = (1 * 28) + (7 * (1 * 0) / 2) = 28`
* `start = 2`
* `remainingDaysSum = (3 * (2*2 + (3 - 1))) / 2 = (3 * 6) / 2 = 9`
* `total = 28 + 9 = 37`

Output = **37**


### Example 3

```
n = 20
```

* `weeks = 2`
* `days = 6`
* `fullWeeksSum = (2 * 28) + (7 * (2 * 1) / 2) = 56 + 7 = 63`
* `start = 3`
* `remainingDaysSum = (6 * (2*3 + (6 - 1))) / 2 = (6 * 11) / 2 = 33`
* `total = 63 + 33 = 96`

Output = **96**

---

## Summary:

* The pattern repeats every week with +1 increment.
* Use arithmetic series formulas for both complete and partial weeks.
* Runs in O(1) — very efficient and clean.
