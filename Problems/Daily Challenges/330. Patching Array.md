[330. Patching Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/patching-array/)

# Intuition

1. **Track the Missing Number**: Start with `miss = 1`. This represents the smallest number that cannot be formed with the sums of elements in the current array.
  
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Iterate through the array while `miss` is less than or equal to `n`. For each element in the array:
   - If the current element `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `miss`, use `nums[i]` to extend the range of constructible sums. Update `miss` to `miss + nums[i]`.
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `miss`, it means we need to patch the array with `miss` because `miss` cannot be formed yet. Increment the patch count and update `miss` to `miss * 2` because adding `miss` extends the range of constructible sums significantly.

3. **Patching**: Continue this process until `miss` exceeds `n`, meaning we've covered all numbers in the range `[1, n]`.

# Approach

1. Initialize `miss` to 1 and `patches` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array and for each element, decide whether to use it or to patch the array with the current value of `miss`.
3. If all elements are used and `miss` is still within `n`, continue patching until `miss` exceeds `n`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m + log n)*** where m is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and in the worst case, we may need to patch up to `log n` times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we use only a few additional variables.

# Code

```typescript
function minPatches(nums: number[], n: number): number {
    let miss = 1;
    let patches = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (miss <= n) {
        if (i < nums.length && nums[i] <= miss) {
            miss += nums[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            miss += miss;
            patches++;
        }
    }

    return patches;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: `miss` is initialized to 1 because we start by needing to form the number 1. `patches` is initialized to 0 because we haven't added any patches yet. `i` is the index to iterate through the `nums` array.

2. **While Loop**: The loop runs until `miss` exceeds `n`, which means we've covered all numbers up to `n`.
   - **If Condition**: If the current element in `nums` is less than or equal to `miss`, it can help in forming the next range of sums. So, we add `nums[i]` to `miss` and move to the next element by incrementing `i`.
   - **Else Condition**: If the current element in `nums` is greater than `miss`, we patch the array by adding `miss`. This effectively doubles the range of sums that can be formed (`miss` is added to itself).

3. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the number of patches added to ensure that all numbers in the range `[1, n]` can be formed.
