[2707. Extra Characters in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/extra-characters-in-a-string/)

# Intuition:

The problem is about breaking the string `s` into substrings where each substring is present in the given `dictionary`. The goal is to minimize the number of leftover characters in `s` that cannot be part of any valid substring.

This problem can be approached using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
- We can maintain a DP array where each position `i` represents the minimum number of extra characters left over after splitting the substring `s[0:i]` optimally.
- For each index `i` in `s`, we check if there's any valid word in the `dictionary` that ends at `i`. If so, we update the DP array to reflect that the substring can be covered, reducing the extra characters.

# Approach:

1. **DP Array**:
   - Create a DP array `dp` of size `n+1`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of extra characters if we consider the substring `s[0:i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` since no extra characters are left when no substring is considered.

2. **Update DP Array**:
   - For each index `i`, try to match every possible word from the dictionary that ends at `i`.
   - If a word `w` from the dictionary matches a substring of `s` that ends at `i`, then we can update `dp[i]` to reflect that the extra characters can be minimized.

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The result will be stored in `dp[n]`, where `n` is the length of `s`, indicating the minimum number of extra characters left over after optimally splitting the entire string.

# Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n × m)***, where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the total length of the words in the dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the DP array.

# Code:

```typescript
function minExtraChar(s: string, dictionary: string[]): number {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;

        for (const word of dictionary) {
            const len = word.length;
            if (i >= len && s.slice(i - len, i) === word) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - len]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **DP Array Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the minimum number of extra characters for each prefix of the string `s`. We assume that initially, each character in the substring is "extra."

2. **DP Update**:
   - For each position `i` in the string `s`, we iterate over all the words in the dictionary.
   - If the word `w` from the dictionary matches a substring that ends at `i`, we update `dp[i]` to reflect that the substring can be covered, reducing the extra characters.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The final answer is `dp[n]`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `s = "leetscode"`, `dictionary = ["leet", "code", "leetcode"]`

1. Initialize `dp` array: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
   
2. Start iterating through `s` and checking substrings:
   - At `i = 4`, the substring `"leet"` matches with `dictionary[0]`, so we update `dp[4] = dp[0] = 0`.
   - At `i = 8`, the substring `"code"` matches with `dictionary[1]`, so we update `dp[8] = dp[4] = 1`.

3. Final `dp` array: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 1]`

**Output**: `1`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `s = "sayhelloworld"`, `dictionary = ["hello", "world"]`

1. Initialize `dp` array: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]`
   
2. Start iterating through `s` and checking substrings:
   - At `i = 7`, the substring `"hello"` matches with `dictionary[0]`, so we update `dp[7] = dp[2] = 3`.
   - At `i = 12`, the substring `"world"` matches with `dictionary[1]`, so we update `dp[12] = dp[7] = 3`.

3. Final `dp` array: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4]`

**Output**: `3`

### Conclusion:
This solution uses dynamic programming to optimally break the string `s` into valid substrings present in the dictionary. By maintaining a DP array to track the minimum number of extra characters, the solution efficiently finds the optimal result with time complexity ***O(n × m)***, which is suitable for the given constraints.
