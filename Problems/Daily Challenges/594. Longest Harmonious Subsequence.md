[594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

### Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `nums`, and your goal is to find the **length of the longest harmonious subsequence**, where:
* A *harmonious subsequence* is a subsequence where the **difference between the maximum and minimum value is exactly 1**.

---

# Intuition

The key observations are:

* We're looking for **elements that differ by exactly 1** (i.e., a pair like `x` and `x+1`).
* Since a subsequence does **not need to be contiguous**, we just need to count how many `x` and `x+1` are present.
* Then, we can consider each such pair and take the sum of their frequencies — the largest such sum will be our result.

---

# Approach

1. Count the frequency of each number in the array using a hashmap.
2. Iterate through the keys of the hashmap.
3. For each key `num`, check if `num + 1` exists in the map.
4. If it does, compute `freq[num] + freq[num + 1]` and update the result if it's larger than the current maximum.
5. Return the maximum found.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
  * One pass to build the frequency map.
  * One pass through the map's keys.
  
* **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the frequency map.

# Code

```ts
function findLHS(nums: number[]): number {
    const freq = new Map<number, number>();

    // Count frequency of each number
    for (const num of nums) {
        freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }

    let maxLen = 0;

    // Check for harmonious pairs
    for (const [num, count] of freq.entries()) {
        if (freq.has(num + 1)) {
            const nextCount = freq.get(num + 1)!;
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, count + nextCount);
        }
    }

    return maxLen;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
```

* Frequency map:

  * 1 → 1
  * 2 → 3
  * 3 → 2
  * 5 → 1
  * 7 → 1
* Pairs:

  * (2,3) → 3 + 2 = 5
  * (1,2) → 1 + 3 = 4
* Max = 5

**Output: 5**

---

#### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: [1,2,3,4]
```

* Frequency:

  * 1 → 1
  * 2 → 1
  * 3 → 1
  * 4 → 1
* Pairs:
  * (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) → All = 1 + 1 = 2

**Output: 2**

---

#### **Example 3**

```ts
Input: [1,1,1,1]
```

* Frequency:
  * 1 → 4
  
* No pairs with difference 1

**Output: 0**

---

### **Summary**

This efficient frequency-based approach lets us identify all valid harmonious subsequences by just counting, avoiding the need to generate actual subsequences. This is optimal for large inputs (up to 20,000 elements).
