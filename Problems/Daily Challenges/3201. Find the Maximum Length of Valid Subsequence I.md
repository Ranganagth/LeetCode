[3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-i/)

### Problem Summary

We are given an array `nums`. A **subsequence** is valid if:

```ts
(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2
```

We need to find the **length of the longest valid subsequence**.

---

# Intuition

The condition is that the **parity (even or odd)** of the **sum of every two consecutive elements** in the subsequence must be **constant**.

There are **only two possibilities** for `(a + b) % 2`:
* `0`: when both are even or both are odd
* `1`: when one is even and the other is odd

So we are essentially forming a **longest subsequence** such that:
* Either all adjacent pairs have **same parity sum**
* That is, they alternate between even-odd or stay same (like all even-even)

---

# Approach

We simulate the building of subsequences based on `(a + b) % 2`:
* Use a **2D array** `f[2][2]`:
  * `f[x][y]` = longest subsequence ending with `(x, y)` such that `x` and `y` are parities (0 for even, 1 for odd)
  
* For each number `x` in `nums`, we:
  * Determine its parity `x % 2`
  * Try appending it to subsequences of previous parity `y`
  * Update `f[x][y] = f[y][x] + 1
  `
* Track the **maximum** `f[x][y]`

---
# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** `O(n)` — one pass through `nums`, and constant operations per element.
* **Space:** `O(1)` — fixed-size `2x2` matrix for tracking parity states.

# Code

```ts
function maximumLength(nums: number[]): number {
    const k = 2; // because we only care about parity (0 or 1)
    const f: number[][] = Array.from({ length: k }, () => Array(k).fill(0));
    let ans = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        const x = num % 2;

        for (let j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            const y = (j - x + k) % k; // ensures non-negative result in mod
            f[x][y] = f[y][x] + 1;
            ans = Math.max(ans, f[x][y]);
        }
    }

    return ans;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`

Parities: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`

* Start with `f[1][0] = 1` from \[1,2]
* Then extend it:

  * \[1,2,1], \[1,2,1,2], ...
* This builds alternating parity subsequence → valid
* Final `ans = 6`

Output: `6`

---

### **Summary**

By reducing the problem to tracking **parity transitions**, we avoid generating all subsequences, making the solution fast and optimal.
