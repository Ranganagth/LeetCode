[2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-prefix-scores-of-strings/)

# Intuition

The task requires calculating the score of each string in the `words` array, where the score is based on how many times each prefix of the string appears as a prefix in the entire `words` array. This problem is well-suited for using **prefix counting** and efficient string matching.

# Approach

We can solve this problem using a **Trie (prefix tree)**, which is designed to efficiently store and search prefixes of strings. Here's the plan:

1. **Build a Trie**: 
    - Insert each word into the Trie while counting how many times each prefix appears. Every node in the Trie will store how many words have passed through that node, allowing us to quickly calculate the score for any prefix.

2. **Calculate Scores**: 
    - For each word in the array, traverse its prefixes (from shortest to longest) and sum up the counts stored at each node in the Trie.

### Trie Structure

- Each node in the Trie represents a letter in a word.
- Each node also stores a count (`prefixCount`) representing how many words pass through that prefix.
  
### Steps

1. **Insert all words into the Trie**: As each word is inserted, increment the count at each node (prefix) to track how many words share that prefix.
  
2. **Calculate the score for each word**: For each word, traverse the Trie and add up the prefix counts at every node that corresponds to its prefixes.

# Complexity

- **Trie Insertion**: For each word, inserting into the Trie takes O(length of the word). In the worst case, this is O(n * k), where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words.
  
- **Score Calculation**: Similarly, calculating the score involves traversing the prefixes, which is also O(n * k).
		Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n * k)**.

- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n * k)*** for storing the Trie.
# Code:

```typescript
class TrieNode {
    children: Map<string, TrieNode>;
    prefixCount: number;

    constructor() {
        this.children = new Map();
        this.prefixCount = 0;
    }
}

class Trie {
    root: TrieNode;

    constructor() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }

    insert(word: string): void {
        let node = this.root;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!node.children.has(char)) {
                node.children.set(char, new TrieNode());
            }
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
            node.prefixCount++;
        }
    }

    getScore(word: string): number {
        let node = this.root;
        let score = 0;
        for (const char of word) {
            node = node.children.get(char)!;
            score += node.prefixCount;
        }
        return score;
    }
}

function sumOfScores(words: string[]): number[] {
    const trie = new Trie();
    const result: number[] = [];

    for (const word of words) {
        trie.insert(word);
    }

    for (const word of words) {
        result.push(trie.getScore(word));
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **TrieNode Class**:
    - Each node stores its children (as a `Map` of characters to child nodes) and a `prefixCount` to track how many words pass through that node.

2. **Trie Class**:
    - The `insert` method inserts a word into the Trie, updating the `prefixCount` at each node.
    - The `getScore` method traverses the Trie for a given word and sums the `prefixCount` at each prefix node.

3. **sumOfScores Function**:
    - First, all words are inserted into the Trie.
    - Then, for each word, the total score is calculated by summing the prefix counts as we traverse its prefixes in the Trie.

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**:

Input: `words = ["abc", "ab", "bc", "b"]`

- **Trie Insertion**:
    - "abc" is inserted, updating nodes for `a -> ab -> abc` with prefix counts 1.
    - "ab" is inserted, updating `a -> ab` (now prefix count becomes 2 for both `a` and `ab`).
    - "bc" is inserted, updating `b -> bc` with prefix counts 1.
    - "b" is inserted, updating `b` (prefix count becomes 2 for `b`).

- **Score Calculation**:
    - For "abc":
        - Prefix `a` has count 2, prefix `ab` has count 2, prefix `abc` has count 1. Total: 5.
    - For "ab":
        - Prefix `a` has count 2, prefix `ab` has count 2. Total: 4.
    - For "bc":
        - Prefix `b` has count 2, prefix `bc` has count 1. Total: 3.
    - For "b":
        - Prefix `b` has count 2. Total: 2.

Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2]`

**Example 2**:

Input: `words = ["abcd"]`

- **Trie Insertion**:
    - "abcd" is inserted, updating `a -> ab -> abc -> abcd` with prefix counts 1.

- **Score Calculation**:
    - For "abcd":
        - Prefix `a` has count 1, prefix `ab` has count 1, prefix `abc` has count 1, prefix `abcd` has count 1. Total: 4.

Output: `[4]`
