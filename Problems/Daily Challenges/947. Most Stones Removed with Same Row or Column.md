[947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-stones-removed-with-same-row-or-column/)

# Intuition

The problem can be understood as finding the maximum number of stones that can be removed from the grid while ensuring that at least one stone remains in every connected component (a group of stones connected through rows and columns).

If you consider each stone as a node in a graph, and thereâ€™s an edge between two nodes if the stones are in the same row or the same column, the problem becomes finding the number of connected components in the graph. For each connected component, you can remove all but one stone.

# Approach

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Treat each stone as a node.
   - Connect nodes with an edge if they share the same row or column.

2. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**:
   - Use Union-Find to group stones that are in the same row or column.
   - Each connected component represents a group of stones that are interlinked by rows or columns.

3. **Counting Removals**:
   - The number of stones that can be removed from each connected component is equal to the size of the component minus one.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The total number of stones that can be removed is the sum of the above values for all connected components.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** in the average case due to the Union-Find operations, where `n` is the number of stones.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** to store the parent and rank arrays for Union-Find.

# Code

```typescript
class UnionFind {
    parent: Map<number, number>;
    rank: Map<number, number>;

    constructor() {
        this.parent = new Map();
        this.rank = new Map();
    }

    find(x: number): number {
        if (!this.parent.has(x)) {
            this.parent.set(x, x);
            this.rank.set(x, 0);
        }
        if (this.parent.get(x) !== x) {
            this.parent.set(x, this.find(this.parent.get(x)!));
        }
        return this.parent.get(x)!;
    }

    union(x: number, y: number) {
        const rootX = this.find(x);
        const rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            const rankX = this.rank.get(rootX)!;
            const rankY = this.rank.get(rootY)!;

            if (rankX > rankY) {
                this.parent.set(rootY, rootX);
            } else if (rankX < rankY) {
                this.parent.set(rootX, rootY);
            } else {
                this.parent.set(rootY, rootX);
                this.rank.set(rootX, rankX + 1);
            }
        }
    }
}

function removeStones(stones: number[][]): number {
    const uf = new UnionFind();

    for (const [x, y] of stones) {
        uf.union(x, ~y);
    }

    const uniqueRoots = new Set<number>();
    for (const [x, y] of stones) {
        uniqueRoots.add(uf.find(x));
    }

    return stones.length - uniqueRoots.size;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **UnionFind Class**:
   - The `UnionFind` class helps to efficiently group connected stones using `find` and `union` operations.

2. **Union Operation**:
   - For each stone, connect its row index and a negated column index using the `union` method. Negating the column index ensures that row and column indices are treated as distinct nodes.

3. **Counting Connected Components**:
   - After processing all stones, we count how many unique groups (connected components) exist.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The number of stones that can be removed is calculated by subtracting the number of unique groups from the total number of stones.
