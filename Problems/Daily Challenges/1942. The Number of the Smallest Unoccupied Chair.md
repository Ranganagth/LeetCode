[1942. The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-the-smallest-unoccupied-chair/)
# Intuition:

You are given a list of friends arriving and leaving a party, and you need to figure out which chair a specific friend (`targetFriend`) will sit on. Each friend, when they arrive, sits in the lowest-numbered available chair, and when they leave, their chair becomes available again. The task is to track these chair assignments and determine which chair the `targetFriend` will sit on.

# Approach:

1. **Heap Usage for Chair Management**: 
   - Use a **min-heap** to manage the available chairs. This will allow us to efficiently assign the smallest available chair to each arriving friend.
   - Another **min-heap** tracks the chairs currently occupied, sorted by their departure times. As soon as a friend departs, their chair becomes available again.

2. **Handling Events**:
   - First, append the index of each friend to their respective arrival and leaving times for easy tracking.
   - Sort the friends by their **arrival time**.
   - For each arriving friend, check if any chairs have been freed by previous friends who have already left the party, and push these freed chairs back into the available chairs heap.
   - Assign the smallest available chair to the current arriving friend.
   - If the current friend is the `targetFriend`, return the chair number they are assigned.
   - After assigning a chair, store the departure time and the assigned chair number in the `occupiedChairs` heap.

3. **Process Flow**:
   - For each friend, when they arrive, check if any chairs have been freed by friends leaving earlier. Assign the smallest chair and record their departure in the heap.
   - Once the target friendâ€™s chair is found, return it.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Sorting the `times` array by arrival time takes **O(n log n)**, where *n* is the number of friends.
  - Each friend is processed once, and inserting/removing from heaps is **O(log n)** for each operation, so iterating over all friends also contributes **O(n log n)**.
  - Overall time complexity: ***O(n log n)***.

- **Space Complexity**: 
  - We use two heaps: one for available chairs and another for occupied chairs. Both heaps store at most *n* elements, where *n* is the number of friends. The space complexity is ***O(n)***.

# Code:

```typescript
class MinHeap<T> {
    private heap: T[] = [];

    constructor(private comparator: (a: T, b: T) => number) {}

    public push(value: T) {
        this.heap.push(value);
        this.bubbleUp();
    }

    public pop(): T | undefined {
        const top = this.heap[0];
        const end = this.heap.pop();
        if (this.heap.length > 0 && end !== undefined) {
            this.heap[0] = end;
            this.bubbleDown();
        }
        return top;
    }

    public peek(): T | undefined {
        return this.heap[0];
    }

        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            const parent = this.heap[parentIndex];
            if (this.comparator(element, parent) >= 0) break;
            this.heap[index] = parent;
            index = parentIndex;
        }

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `times = [[1,4],[2,3],[4,6]], targetFriend = 1`

1. Sort the `times` by arrival: `[[1,4,0], [2,3,1], [4,6,2]]`
2. **Step 1**: Friend 0 arrives at time 1 and takes chair 0.  
   **Step 2**: Friend 1 arrives at time 2 and takes chair 1.  
   **Step 3**: Friend 1 leaves at time 3, freeing chair 1.
   **Step 4**: Friend 2 arrives at time 4 and takes chair 0.

**Output**: `1` (Friend 1 took chair 1).

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `times = [[3,10],[1,5],[2,6]], targetFriend = 0`

1. Sort the `times` by arrival: `[[1,5,1], [2,6,2], [3,10,0]]`
2. **Step 1**: Friend 1 arrives at time 1 and takes chair 0.  
   **Step 2**: Friend 2 arrives at time 2 and takes chair 1.  
   **Step 3**: Friend 0 arrives at time 3 and takes chair 2.  
   **Step 4**: Friend 1 leaves at time 5, freeing chair 0.

**Output**: `2` (Friend 0 took chair 2).
