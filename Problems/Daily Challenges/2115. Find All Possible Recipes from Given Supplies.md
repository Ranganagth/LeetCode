[2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-possible-recipes-from-given-supplies/)

# Intuition

The problem can be modeled as a **directed graph** where:
- **Nodes** represent ingredients and recipes.
- **Edges** represent dependencies (i.e., a recipe requires certain ingredients).
- We need to determine which recipes can be made given initial supplies.

The challenge is that **some recipes depend on other recipes**, forming a dependency chain.  
This suggests using **topological sorting** to process recipes in an order where their dependencies are satisfied.

# Approach

1. **Build a dependency graph**:
    - Each recipe is a **node**.
    - If a recipe `r` needs an ingredient `ing`, we create a **directed edge** from `ing` to `r`.
    - Track the **in-degree** (number of unmet dependencies) for each recipe.
	
2. **Initialize a queue** with all **available supplies** since these can be used immediately.
    
3. **Process recipes in a topological order**:
    - While the queue is not empty:
        - Take an available ingredient (or recipe) from the queue.
        - Reduce the **in-degree** of recipes that depend on it.
        - If a recipe’s in-degree becomes **0**, add it to the queue (it can now be made).
		
4. **Return all recipes that were successfully created**.
    

# Complexity Analysis

- **Building the graph**: O(N+M)O(N + M) where NN is the number of recipes and MM is the total number of ingredient-recipe dependencies.
- **Processing recipes using BFS**: O(N+M)O(N + M), since every recipe and ingredient is processed once.
- **Overall Complexity**: **O(N+M)O(N + M) → Efficient for large inputs**.

# Code

```typescript
function findAllRecipes(recipes: string[], ingredients: string[][], supplies: string[]): string[] {
    const graph = new Map<string, string[]>(); // Adjacency list
    const inDegree = new Map<string, number>(); // Track dependencies
    const available = new Set<string>(supplies); // Ingredients we already have

    // Step 1: Build the graph and compute in-degrees
    for (let i = 0; i < recipes.length; i++) {
        const recipe = recipes[i];
        inDegree.set(recipe, (ingredients[i]?.length) || 0); // Track number of dependencies
        for (const ing of ingredients[i]) {
            if (!graph.has(ing)) graph.set(ing, []);
            graph.get(ing)!.push(recipe); // ing → recipe (directed edge)
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize queue with available ingredients
    const queue: string[] = [...supplies];

    // Step 3: Process the queue (Topological Sort using BFS)
    const result: string[] = [];
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift()!;
        
        if (inDegree.has(current)) {
            result.push(current); // If current is a recipe, it's now created
        }

        if (!graph.has(current)) continue; // No dependencies

        for (const dependentRecipe of graph.get(current)!) {
            inDegree.set(dependentRecipe, inDegree.get(dependentRecipe)! - 1);
            if (inDegree.get(dependentRecipe) === 0) {
                queue.push(dependentRecipe); // All dependencies met, can be made now
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Input**

```typescript
const recipes = ["bread", "sandwich", "burger"];
const ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "meat"], ["sandwich", "meat", "bread"]];
const supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "meat"];
console.log(findAllRecipes(recipes, ingredients, supplies));
```

### **Graph Construction**

```
  yeast  ---> bread
  flour  ---> bread
  bread  ---> sandwich
  meat   ---> sandwich
  sandwich ---> burger
  meat   ---> burger
```

### **Processing (Topological Order)**

1. **Queue Initialization** → `["yeast", "flour", "meat"]`
2. **Process "yeast", "flour"** → Unlocks **"bread"**.
3. **Process "meat"** → Unlocks **"sandwich"**.
4. **Process "bread"** → Unlocks **"sandwich"**.
5. **Process "sandwich"** → Unlocks **"burger"**.
6. **Process "burger"** → All recipes are now created.

### **Output**

```typescript
["bread", "sandwich", "burger"]
```

_(Order may vary depending on queue processing.)_

## **Why is this Optimal?**

**Efficiently handles dependencies** using **topological sorting**.  
**Only processes each recipe once** using **O(N + M) time**.  
**Avoids unnecessary re-computation** by keeping track of dependencies using **in-degree**.

This method ensures we **only create recipes when all their ingredients are available** and efficiently finds all possible recipes **without redundant checks**.
