[2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/)

# Intuition

The problem is a **Dynamic Programming (DP) problem** where:

- At each question, we have **two choices**:
    1. **Solve the question**: Earn `points[i]` but skip `brainpower[i]` questions.
    2. **Skip the question**: Move to the next question.
- The goal is to **maximize the total points earned**.

### **Key Observations**

- The problem exhibits **optimal substructure**, meaning the solution for each state depends on previously computed results.
- It also exhibits **overlapping subproblems**, making DP an ideal approach.
- We can use **bottom-up DP with memoization** to solve this efficiently.

# Approach

1. **Define DP State**:
    - Let `dp[i]` represent the **maximum points obtainable** starting from question `i`.
    
2. **Transition Formula**:
    - If we **skip** question `i`, we move to `i + 1`:
    $$\text{skip} = dp[i + 1]$$
    - If we **solve** question `i`, we gain `points[i]` and must skip `brainpower[i]` questions:
       $$\text{solve} = \text{points}[i] + dp[i + 1 + \text{brainpower}[i]]$$
    - The recurrence relation is:
    $$dp[i] = \max(\text{skip}, \text{solve})$$
3. **Base Case**:
    - `dp[n] = 0` (if we are beyond the last question, we earn 0 points).
	
4. **Bottom-Up DP Approach**:
    - Start from the last question and move backward.
    - Use a **single 1D array** to store the results.

# Complexity Analysis

| Step                           | Operation                         | Complexity          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Iterate over questions**     | Compute `dp[i]` for each `i`      | O(n)                |
| **Access points & brainpower** | Constant-time lookup per question | O(1)                |
| **Total Complexity**           | O(n)                              | Efficient for n≤10⁵ |

# Code

```typescript
function mostPoints(questions: number[][]): number {
    const n = questions.length;
    const dp: number[] = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Start computing from the last question backwards
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let [points, brainpower] = questions[i];
        
        // Option 1: Skip the question
        let skip = dp[i + 1];

        // Option 2: Solve the question
        let solve = points + (dp[i + 1 + brainpower] || 0);

        // Take the maximum of the two choices
        dp[i] = Math.max(skip, solve);
    }

    return dp[0];
};

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input**

```typescript
console.log(mostPoints([[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]));
```

#### **Processing**

|Question|Points|Brainpower|Options|
|---|---|---|---|
|**3rd (last)**|`2`|`5`|Solve: `2`, Skip: `0`, `dp[3] = 2`|
|**2nd**|`4`|`4`|Solve: `4`, Skip: `2`, `dp[2] = 4`|
|**1st**|`4`|`3`|Solve: `4`, Skip: `4`, `dp[1] = 4`|
|**0th (first)**|`3`|`2`|Solve: `3 + dp[3] = 5`, Skip: `4`, `dp[0] = 5`|

#### **Output**

```typescript
5
```

### **Example 2**

#### **Input**

```typescript
console.log(mostPoints([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]));
```

#### **Processing**

|Question|Points|Brainpower|Options|
|---|---|---|---|
|**4th (last)**|`5`|`5`|Solve: `5`, Skip: `0`, `dp[4] = 5`|
|**3rd**|`4`|`4`|Solve: `4`, Skip: `5`, `dp[3] = 5`|
|**2nd**|`3`|`3`|Solve: `3`, Skip: `5`, `dp[2] = 5`|
|**1st**|`2`|`2`|Solve: `2 + dp[4] = 7`, Skip: `5`, `dp[1] = 7`|
|**0th (first)**|`1`|`1`|Solve: `1 + dp[2] = 6`, Skip: `7`, `dp[0] = 7`|

#### **Output**

```typescript
7
```

## **Final Thoughts**

**Uses Dynamic Programming for an efficient solution**  
**Runs in O(n) time, which is optimal for large constraints**  
**Only requires an array of size O(n), reducing memory usage**
