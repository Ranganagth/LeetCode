[1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag/)

# Intuition:

To minimize the penalty (the maximum number of balls in any bag), we can:
1. Use **binary search** on the possible penalty values (range `[1, max(nums)]`).
2. For a mid-value penalty, calculate how many operations are needed to ensure no bag exceeds that penalty.
3. Adjust the binary search bounds based on whether the current mid-value can achieve the desired condition within `maxOperations`.

This approach avoids directly simulating all possible splits for each bag, which would be computationally expensive.

# Approach:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:    
    - `left = 1`: Minimum possible penalty (1 ball per bag).
    - `right = max(nums)`: Worst-case penalty (largest bag size without any splits).
2. **Binary Search Logic**: 
    - Calculate the mid-point (`mid`) of the current range.
    - For each bag in `nums`, calculate the operations needed to reduce its size to `mid` or smaller:
        - operations= [(bag size - 1)/mid.
    - Sum these operations for all bags:
        - If the total operations ≤ maxOperations, try a smaller penalty (`right = mid`).
        - Else, increase the penalty (`left = mid + 1`).
3. **Result**:    
    - The binary search converges when `left == right`, which gives the minimum possible penalty.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
    - ***O(n⋅log⁡(max(nums)))***:
        - ***O(n)*** to calculate operations for all bags in each binary search iteration.
        - ***O(log⁡(max(nums)))*** binary search iterations.
- **Space Complexity**:
    - ***O(1)***, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

# Code:

```typescript
function minimumSize(nums: number[], maxOperations: number): number {
    let left = 1;
    let right = Math.max(...nums); // Maximum possible penalty.

    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let operationsCount = 0;

        // Calculate total operations needed for this mid value
        for (const ballSize of nums) {
            operationsCount += Math.floor((ballSize - 1) / mid);
        }

        // Check if the current mid value is valid
        if (operationsCount <= maxOperations) {
            right = mid; // Try to reduce the penalty
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // Increase the penalty
        }
    }

    return left; // The minimum penalty is stored in left
};

```

### Example and Explanation Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

```typescript
nums = [9];
maxOperations = 2;
```

**Execution**:

1. **Initial Binary Search Range**:
    - `left = 1`, `right = 9`.
2. **Mid = 5**:
    - Operations needed: [(9 - 1)/5]  = 1 (valid with `maxOperations = 2`).
    - Update `right = 5`.
3. **Mid = 3**:
    - Operations needed: [(9 - 1)/3]  = 2 (valid with `maxOperations = 2`).
    - Update `right = 3`.
4. **Mid = 2**:
    - Operations needed: [(9 - 1)/2] = 4 (exceeds `maxOperations`).
    - Update `left = 3`.

**Output**:

```typescript
3
```

#### Example 2:

**Input**:

```typescript
nums = [2, 4, 8, 2];
maxOperations = 4;
```

**Execution**:

1. **Initial Binary Search Range**:
    - `left = 1`, `right = 8`.
2. **Mid = 4**:
    - Operations needed: [(2−1)/4]+[(4 − 1)/4]+[(8 − 1)/4]+[(2 − 1)/4]=0+0+1+0=1 (valid).
    - Update `right = 4`.
3. **Mid = 2**:
    - Operations needed: 0+1+3+0=4 (valid).
    - Update `right = 2`.
4. **Mid = 1**:
    - Operations needed: 1+3+7+1=12 (exceeds `maxOperations`).
    - Update `left = 2`.

**Output**:
```typescript
2
```
