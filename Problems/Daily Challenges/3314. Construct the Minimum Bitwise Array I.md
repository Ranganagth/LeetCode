[3314. Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-minimum-bitwise-array-i/)

# Intuition

We need the **smallest non-negative integer `x`** such that:

```
x OR (x + 1) = p
```

Key facts:

1. `x OR (x + 1)` is **always odd**

   * Therefore **even `p` is impossible**
2. For **odd `p`**, a solution **may** exist
3. There is **no simple formula** that always gives the *minimum* `x`
4. Constraints are small:

   * `nums[i] ≤ 1000`
   * `nums.length ≤ 100`

So the **correct and optimal strategy** is:

> **Brute-force `x` from 0 upward until the condition holds**

This is guaranteed fast and correct.

# Approach

For each `p = nums[i]`:

1. If `p` is even → `ans[i] = -1`
2. Else:

   * Try all `x` from `0` to `p`
   * Pick the **first** `x` such that:

     ```
     x | (x + 1) === p
     ```
   * If none found → `-1`

This guarantees:

* correctness
* minimal `x`
* no TLE

---

# Complexity

* **Time:**
  Worst case: `O(n × max(nums[i])) = 100 × 1000 = 100,000`
* **Space:** `O(1)` extra

This is trivial for the constraints.

# Code

```ts
function minBitwiseArray(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const ans: number[] = [];

    for (const p of nums) {
        // Even numbers are impossible
        if ((p & 1) === 0) {
            ans.push(-1);
            continue;
        }

        let found = -1;
        for (let x = 0; x <= p; x++) {
            if ((x | (x + 1)) === p) {
                found = x;
                break; // smallest x
            }
        }

        ans.push(found);
    }

    return ans;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

### Input

```
nums = [2,3,5,7]
```

### Processing

| p   | Try x | x OR (x+1) | Result      |       |     |
| --- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- | ----- | --- |
| 2   | —     | —          | ❌ even → -1 |       |     |
| 3   | 0 → 1 | 0          | 1=1 ❌, 1    | 2=3 ✅ | 1   |
| 5   | 0 → 4 | 4          | 5=5 ✅       | 4     |     |
| 7   | 0 → 3 | 3          | 4=7 ✅       | 3     |     |

### Output

```
[-1, 1, 4, 3]
```

**Matches expected output**

## Final Takeaway

* This problem **looks like bit-math**, but the *minimum* requirement breaks shortcuts
* **Brute force is the correct optimal solution**
* Any “formula-only” solution will fail edge cases
