[2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-completely-painted-row-or-column/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest index *i* in `arr` where either a **row** or a **column** in `mat` becomes fully painted. Each number in `arr` corresponds to a unique cell in `mat`. As we iterate through `arr` and paint the corresponding cells in `mat`, we track the count of painted cells for each row and column. Once the count for any row or column matches its size, we return the current index *i*.

# Approach

1. **Mapping Matrix Positions**:
    - Create a hash map `position` to store the mapping of numbers in `mat` to their corresponding `(row, column)` indices.
	
2. **Count Tracking**:
    - Use two arrays, `rowPaintCount` and `colPaintCount`, to keep track of how many cells are painted in each row and column.
	
3. **Simulate Painting**:
    - Iterate through `arr`. For each number:
        - Find its position `(r, c)` using the hash map.
        - Increment the count for `rowPaintCount[r]` and `colPaintCount[c]`.
        - Check if the row rr or column cc is fully painted (i.e., the count matches the row's or column's size).
        - If fully painted, return the current index.
		
4. **Early Termination**:    
    - The moment a row or column becomes fully painted, stop processing further numbers and return the index.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - **Mapping positions**: **O(m⋅n)**, where *m* is the number of rows and *n* is the number of columns in `mat`.
    - **Processing `arr`**: **O(m⋅n)** since each number in `arr` corresponds to one painting operation.
    - Overall: ***O(m⋅n)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Hash map for positions: **O(m⋅n)**.
    - Count arrays: **O(m + n)**.
    - Total: ***O(m⋅n)***.

# Code

```typescript
function firstCompleteIndex(arr: number[], mat: number[][]): number {
    const m = mat.length;
    const n = mat[0].length;

    // Map each value in mat to its (row, col) position.
    const position = new Map<number, [number, number]>();
    for (let r = 0; r < m; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            position.set(mat[r][c], [r, c]);
        }
    }

    // Initialize counters for rows and columns.
    const rowPaintCount = new Array(m).fill(0);
    const colPaintCount = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Process arr to paint cells.
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        const num = arr[i];
        const [r, c] = position.get(num)!; // Get the (row, col) of the current number.

        // Increment row and column counters.
        rowPaintCount[r]++;
        colPaintCount[c]++;

        // Check if the row or column is fully painted.
        if (rowPaintCount[r] === n || colPaintCount[c] === m) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1; // This line should never be reached due to the constraints.
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const arr = [1, 3, 4, 2];
const mat = [
    [1, 4],
    [2, 3]
];
console.log(firstCompleteIndex(arr, mat)); // Output: 2
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. **Mapping Positions**:
    - `1 → (0, 0)`, `4 → (0, 1)`, `2 → (1, 0)`, `3 → (1, 1)`.
	
2. **Painting Steps**:
    - *i = 0, num = 1, rowPaintCount = [1,0], colPaintCount = [1,0]*.
    - *i = 1, num = 3, rowPaintCount = [1,1], colPaintCount = [1,1]*.
    - *i = 2, num = 4*:
        - Row *0*: Painted fully (*rowPaintCount[0] = 2*).
        - Return *i = 2*.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const arr = [2, 8, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9];
const mat = [
    [3, 2, 5],
    [1, 4, 6],
    [8, 7, 9]
];
console.log(firstCompleteIndex(arr, mat)); // Output: 3
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. **Mapping Positions**:
    - Map values in `mat` to positions in `(row, column)` format.
	
2. **Painting Steps**:
    - Paint each number in `arr` and update `rowPaintCount` and `colPaintCount`.
    - At *i = 3*, column *1* becomes fully painted *(colPaintCount[1] = 3)*.
    - Return *i = 3*

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Cell Matrix**:
    - Input: `arr = [1], mat = [[1]]`.
    - Output: `0` (single cell is painted immediately).
	
2. **Row/Column Size Edge Cases**:    
    - Handles scenarios with large *m* and *n*, efficiently updating counts.
