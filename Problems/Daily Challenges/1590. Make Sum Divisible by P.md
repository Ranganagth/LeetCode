[1590. Make Sum Divisible by P](https://leetcode.com/problems/make-sum-divisible-by-p/)

# Intuition:

The task is to find the smallest subarray that can be removed from the given array such that the sum of the remaining elements becomes divisible by a given integer `p`. We are not allowed to remove the entire array, and if no valid subarray exists, we return `-1`.

### Key Observations:

1. **Total Sum Modulo `p`:**
   - We can compute the total sum of the array and check its modulo with `p`. If the sum is already divisible by `p`, we don't need to remove anything, so the answer is `0`.
   
2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - If the total sum modulo `p` is not zero, the problem boils down to finding a subarray whose sum is equivalent to this remainder modulo `p`. By removing this subarray, the sum of the remaining array would be divisible by `p`.

3. **Prefix Sums and Modulo:**
   - The problem can be tackled using prefix sums and modulo operations. By storing the prefix sum modulo `p` at each index, we can find the smallest subarray that can be removed.

4. **Using a Hash Map:**
   - A hash map can be used to store the most recent prefix sum modulo `p` and its corresponding index. This helps in finding the smallest subarray whose sum matches the remainder needed to make the sum divisible by `p`.

# Approach:

1. **Calculate Total Sum Modulo `p`:**
   - Compute the total sum of the array and take `mod` with `p`. If the result is `0`, return `0` since the array is already divisible by `p`.
   
2. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map:**
   - Iterate through the array, and maintain a running prefix sum modulo `p`. At each step, calculate the target remainder that would make the total sum divisible by `p` if this subarray is removed.
   - Use a hash map to store the most recent occurrence of each prefix sum modulo `p`. This allows us to find the smallest subarray that can be removed.

3. **Minimizing Subarray Length:**
   - Keep track of the minimum subarray length that satisfies the condition (i.e., removing it results in a sum divisible by `p`).

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If no valid subarray is found, return `-1`.

# Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n)*** where `n` is the number of elements in the array, since we are iterating through the array once and performing constant-time operations (hash map lookups).
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)*** due to the storage of prefix sums in the hash map.

# Code:

```typescript
function minSubarray(nums: number[], p: number): number {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
    const mod = totalSum % p;

    if (mod === 0) return 0;

    const n = nums.length;
    const prefixSums = new Map<number, number>();
    prefixSums.set(0, -1);

    let prefixSum = 0;
    let minLength = n;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum = (prefixSum + nums[i]) % p;

        const target = (prefixSum - mod + p) % p;

        if (prefixSums.has(target)) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - prefixSums.get(target)!);
        }

        prefixSums.set(prefixSum, i);
    }

    return minLength === n ? -1 : minLength;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Calculate the Total Sum Modulo `p`:**
   - We compute the total sum of the array and take `mod` with `p` to find out how much we need to remove to make the sum divisible by `p`.

2. **Prefix Sum Iteration:**
   - We iterate over the array, updating the running prefix sum modulo `p`. For each element, we compute the `target` value, which represents the prefix sum that needs to be removed.

3. **Hash Map for Prefix Sums:**
   - A hash map (`prefixSums`) is used to store the most recent occurrence of each prefix sum modulo `p`. This allows us to quickly find if removing a subarray with this prefix sum will make the total sum divisible by `p`.

4. **Find the Minimum Subarray Length:**
   - We check the difference between the current index and the stored index of the prefix sum in the hash map. This difference gives us the length of the candidate subarray that can be removed. We update the minimum length if we find a smaller subarray.

5. **Edge Case:**
   - If no valid subarray is found, return `-1`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

- Input: `nums = [3,1,4,2]`, `p = 6`
- **Step 1:** The total sum is `10`, and `10 % 6 = 4`.
- **Step 2:** We need to remove a subarray whose sum is `4 mod 6` to make the remaining sum divisible by `6`.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through the array while maintaining prefix sums:
  - For `i = 0`, prefix sum = `3 % 6 = 3`.
  - For `i = 1`, prefix sum = `(3 + 1) % 6 = 4`. We find the target (`4`), and the subarray [4] is a valid candidate of length 1.
- **Output:** The smallest subarray to remove is [4], so the result is `1`.

#### Example 2:

- Input: `nums = [6,3,5,2]`, `p = 9`
- **Step 1:** The total sum is `16`, and `16 % 9 = 7`.
- **Step 2:** We need to remove a subarray whose sum is `7 mod 9`.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through the array and find the subarray [5,2] as the smallest valid subarray.
- **Output:** The result is `2`.

#### Example 3:

- Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`, `p = 3`
- The total sum is `6`, which is divisible by `3`. Hence, the output is `0` since no subarray needs to be removed.

### Conclusion:

This solution efficiently finds the smallest subarray to remove using prefix sums and a hash map. The time complexity is linear, making it suitable for large input sizes.
