[2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-boolean-binary-tree/)

# Intuition
The evaluation of the tree can be performed using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. We start from the root and recursively evaluate each node based on its type:
- If the node is a leaf, its value directly represents a boolean value.
- If the node is non-leaf, we evaluate its children first and then apply the boolean operation (OR for 2 and AND for 3) to their values.

# Approach
1. **Recursive DFS Traversal**: Traverse the tree using DFS.
2. **Evaluate Leaf Nodes**: If the node is a leaf, return its boolean value (0 for False, 1 for True).
3. **Evaluate Non-Leaf Nodes**: Recursively evaluate the left and right children, then apply the corresponding boolean operation to the results.
4. **Return the Result**: The result of the evaluation at the root node gives the final boolean value of the tree.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(h)***, where \( h \) is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function evaluateTree(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {
    if (!root) {
        return false; 
    }

    if (root.left === null && root.right === null) {
        return root.val === 1;
    }

    const leftEval = evaluateTree(root.left);
    const rightEval = evaluateTree(root.right);

    if (root.val === 2) {
        return leftEval || rightEval;
    } else if (root.val === 3) {
        return leftEval && rightEval;
    }

    return false;
};

```

In this code:
1. **TreeNode**: Class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **evaluateTree**: Function that recursively evaluates the boolean value of the binary tree.
3. **DFS Evaluation**: The function evaluates the left and right subtrees recursively and applies the boolean operation (OR or AND) based on the value of the non-leaf nodes.

> This approach ensures that the tree is evaluated correctly based on the given rules, and it efficiently computes the boolean value of the tree starting from the root.
