[2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill/)

# Intuition:

We are tasked with dividing an array of player skills into teams such that:
1. Each team has exactly two players.
2. The total skill of every team must be the same.
3. The chemistry of each team is the product of the skills of the two players in that team.

If it is possible to divide the players in this way, we return the sum of the chemistry for all teams. If it's not possible to divide the players into teams with the same total skill, we return `-1`.

### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Since we need to divide players into teams where each team's total skill is the same, sorting the array will allow us to check if it's possible to pair the smallest and largest elements to achieve this goal.
   
2. **Pairing Strategy**:
   - After sorting the array, pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. If every pair's total skill is the same, we can compute the chemistry.

3. **Chemistry Calculation**:
   - For each valid pair, the chemistry is the product of the two players' skills. The sum of these products is the answer.

# Approach:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the skill array to allow easy pairing between the smallest and largest elements.
   
2. **Check for Equal Skill Sums**:
   - After sorting, iterate through the first half of the array and check if the sum of each pair (smallest + largest) is equal to the sum of the first pair. If any pair does not match, return `-1`.

3. **Calculate Chemistry**:
   - For each valid pair, calculate the product of the skills and accumulate the sum.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the sum of all chemistry values if all pairs are valid.

# Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting the array. The iteration to check pairs and calculate chemistry takes **O(n)**, making the overall time complexity dominated by sorting, which is ***O(n log n)***.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(1)*** (excluding the input storage), since no additional data structures are required other than a few variables.

# Code:

```typescript
function dividePlayers(skill: number[]): number {
    skill.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    const n = skill.length;
    const targetSkillSum = skill[0] + skill[n - 1];
    
    let totalChemistry = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        const currentSum = skill[i] + skill[n - 1 - i];
        
        if (currentSum !== targetSkillSum) {
            return -1;
        }

        totalChemistry += skill[i] * skill[n - 1 - i];
    }

    return totalChemistry;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Sort the Array**: 
   - We sort the `skill` array to easily pair the smallest and largest elements.
   
2. **Calculate the Target Skill Sum**: 
   - The target sum for all pairs is derived from the sum of the first pair (smallest + largest). This sum is stored in `targetSkillSum`.

3. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element from the start of the array to the midpoint, we check if the current pair's sum matches the `targetSkillSum`. If any pair does not match, we return `-1`.

4. **Calculate Chemistry**:
   - For each valid pair, we calculate the chemistry (product of the two elements in the pair) and add it to `totalChemistry`.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - If all pairs are valid, return the sum of all chemistry values.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]`
- **Step 1**: Sort the array → `skill = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]`
- **Step 2**: Calculate the target skill sum from the first pair → `targetSkillSum = 1 + 5 = 6`
- **Step 3**: Iterate through the array and check pairs:
  - Pair (1, 5) → sum = 6, chemistry = 1 * 5 = 5
  - Pair (2, 4) → sum = 6, chemistry = 2 * 4 = 8
  - Pair (3, 3) → sum = 6, chemistry = 3 * 3 = 9
- **Step 4**: Total chemistry = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22
- **Output**: `22`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `skill = [3,4]`
- **Step 1**: Sort the array → `skill = [3, 4]`
- **Step 2**: Calculate the target skill sum → `targetSkillSum = 3 + 4 = 7`
- **Step 3**: Iterate through the array and check the only pair:
  - Pair (3, 4) → sum = 7, chemistry = 3 * 4 = 12
- **Output**: `12`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `skill = [1,1,2,3]`
- **Step 1**: Sort the array → `skill = [1, 1, 2, 3]`
- **Step 2**: Calculate the target skill sum → `targetSkillSum = 1 + 3 = 4`
- **Step 3**: Iterate through the array and check pairs:
  - Pair (1, 3) → sum = 4, valid
  - Pair (1, 2) → sum = 3, **invalid**
- **Output**: `-1` (since not all pairs can have the same total skill sum)

### Conclusion:

This approach efficiently checks if it is possible to divide the players into valid teams and computes the total chemistry of these teams in ***O(n log n)*** time. By sorting the array and using a two-pointer approach, we ensure that the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.
