[1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-smallest-equivalent-string/)

# Intuition

We are given character equivalencies defined by `s1[i] == s2[i]`. These equivalencies form equivalence classes (groups) of characters. Our goal is to:
1. **Group equivalent characters together.**
2. **For each group, determine the lexicographically smallest character.**
3. **Convert each character in `baseStr` to the smallest equivalent character from its group.**

The best way to manage these character groups efficiently is with **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**, also known as **Union-Find**. DSU lets us group characters and find the representative (or "parent") of each group efficiently.

To ensure the **lexicographically smallest** character is the representative, we always make the **smaller character the parent** when merging sets.

# Approach

1. Initialize a `parent` array of size 26 (for each lowercase letter 'a' to 'z') where each character is its own parent.
2. For each pair `(s1[i], s2[i])`, union their sets while making the lexicographically smaller character the root.
3. For each character in `baseStr`, find its root parent and replace it with the smallest character in its group.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** $O(N * α(26)) ≈ O(N)$ where `N` is the length of `s1`/`s2` and `α` is the inverse Ackermann function (practically constant).
* **Space Complexity:** $O(26)$ for the parent array (constant space).

# Code

```typescript
function smallestEquivalentString(s1: string, s2: string, baseStr: string): string {
    const parent = new Array(26).fill(0).map((_, i) => i);

    // Find root of character index
    const find = (x: number): number => {
        if (parent[x] !== x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // Path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    };

    // Union two character indices with lexicographical priority
    const union = (x: number, y: number): void => {
        const px = find(x);
        const py = find(y);
        if (px === py) return;
        if (px < py) {
            parent[py] = px;
        } else {
            parent[px] = py;
        }
    };

    // Build equivalence groups
    for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
        const c1 = s1.charCodeAt(i) - 97;
        const c2 = s2.charCodeAt(i) - 97;
        union(c1, c2);
    }

    // Build the result using smallest character in equivalence class
    let result = '';
    for (const ch of baseStr) {
        const root = find(ch.charCodeAt(0) - 97);
        result += String.fromCharCode(root + 97);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### **Example 1:**

```ts
s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
```

* Equivalence pairs:
  'p'='m', 'a'='o', 'r'='r', 'k'='i', 'e'='s', 'r'='s'
* Equivalence groups formed:

  * \[m, p] → m
  * \[a, o] → a
  * \[k, i] → i
  * \[r, s, e] → e (eventually reduces to the smallest)
* Replace characters in "parser":

  * p → m
  * a → a
  * r → k (because r \~ s \~ k, and k is smallest)
  * s → k
  * e → e
  * r → k
* **Output:** `"makkek"`

#### **Example 2:**

```ts
s1 = "hello", s2 = "world", baseStr = "hold"
```

* Equivalence groups:

  * h=w → h
  * e=o=d → d
  * l=r → l
* Replace "hold":

  * h → h
  * o → d
  * l → l
  * d → d
* **Output:** `"hdld"`

#### **Example 3:**

```ts
s1 = "leetcode", s2 = "programs", baseStr = "sourcecode"
```

* Groupings:

  * l=p, e=o, e=r, t=g, c=r, o=a, d=m
* Final groupings collapse into:

  * \[a,c,e,o,r,s] → a
  * \[g,t] → g
  * \[d,m] → d
* Replace each letter in baseStr:

  * s → a
  * o → a
  * u → u (no mapping)
  * r → a
  * c → a
  * e → a
  * c → a
  * o → a
  * d → d
  * e → a
* **Output:** `"aauaaaaada"`

### **Summary:**

This solution applies DSU to build equivalence classes while keeping the smallest lexicographical character as the representative, ensuring fast and correct mapping from `baseStr` to the transformed output.
