[1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-kth-bit-in-nth-binary-string/)
# Intuition:

1. **Recursive Definition**: The string *Sᵢ* is formed by concatenating:
   - *Sᵢ₋₁*
   - "1"
   - The reverse of the inverted string *Sᵢ₋₁*

   This implies that *Sᵢ* doubles in size with each step and is constructed based on *Sᵢ₋₁*, along with a "1" and its reverse and inverted counterpart.

2. **String Size**: The length of *Sₙ* is *2ⁿ - 1*. Therefore, for large values of *n*, generating *Sₙ* directly would be infeasible since *S₂₀* has length *2²⁰ - 1 = 1,048,575*.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The middle character of *Sᵢ* is always "1", which is at index *2ⁱ⁻¹* (1-based indexing).
   - For any position *k* in *Sₙ*:
     - If *k* is the middle element, return "1".
     - If *k* is in the left half, it corresponds to *Sₙ₋₁*.
     - If *k* is in the right half, it corresponds to the reverse and inverted part of *Sₙ₋₁*, and the position can be mapped back to the left half of *Sₙ₋₁*.

Thus, instead of constructing the entire string, we can **recursively determine** the value of the *k*th bit based on its position in relation to the middle.

# Approach:

1. **Base Case**: If *n = 1*, *S₁ = "0"*, and the only possible value of *k* is 1, so return "0".
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - If *k = 2ⁿ⁻¹*, return "1" (the middle element).
   - If *k < 2ⁿ⁻¹*, the *k*th bit corresponds to the *k*th bit in *Sₙ₋₁*.
   - If *k > 2ⁿ⁻¹*, the *k*th bit corresponds to the inverted and reversed **(k - 2ⁿ⁻¹)** th bit in *Sₙ₋₁*.

# Complexity:
The **time complexity** is ***O(n)***, as we are essentially halving the problem size at each step of the recursion, which leads to a logarithmic number of steps.

# Code:

```typescript
function findKthBit(n: number, k: number): string {
    function helper(n: number, k: number): string {
        if (n === 1) {
            return "0";
        }
        
        const mid = 1 << (n - 1);

        if (k === mid) {
            return "1";
        } else if (k < mid) {
            return helper(n - 1, k);
        } else {
            const mirrorPos = 2 * mid - k;
            const bit = helper(n - 1, mirrorPos);
            return bit === "0" ? "1" : "0";
        }
    }
    
    return helper(n, k);
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: 
   - For *S₁*, the only character is "0", so return "0" when *n = 1*.
   
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Calculate the middle index *mid = 2ⁿ⁻¹*.
   - If *k* equals the middle index, return "1".
   - If *k* is less than the middle index, recursively find the *k*th bit in *Sₙ₋₁*.
   - If *k* is greater than the middle index, map it to the corresponding position in the reversed and inverted part, find the bit there, and invert it.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: *n = 3, k = 1*

- *S₃ = "0111001"*
- We want to find the 1st bit.
- *n = 3, k = 1* : *k* is less than the middle index (4), so look at *S₂*.
- *S₂ = "011"*
- *n = 2, k = 1* : *k* is less than the middle index (2), so look at *S₁*.
- *S₁ = "0"*
- Return "0".

**Output**: "0"

#### Example 2:
**Input**: *n = 4, k = 11*

- *S₄ = "011100110110001"*
- We want to find the 11th bit.
- *n = 4, k = 11*: *k* is greater than the middle index (8), so look at the mirrored position *2 * 8 - 11 = 5* in *S₃*.
- *n = 3, k = 5*: *k* is greater than the middle index (4), so look at the mirrored position *2 * 4 - 5 = 3* in *S₂*.
- *S₂ = "011"*
- *n = 2, k = 3*: The 3rd bit of *S₂* is "1", invert it to "0".
- Return "1" (since the inversion is only at deeper levels).

**Output**: "1"

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently computes the *k*th bit in *Sₙ* using recursion, without having to construct the entire binary string, thereby optimizing both time and space.
