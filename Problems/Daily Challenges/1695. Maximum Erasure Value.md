[1695. Maximum Erasure Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-erasure-value/)

# Intuition:

We're asked to find a subarray (contiguous segment) with **all unique elements** and the **maximum sum**.

To do this efficiently, we need to:
* Track which elements are currently in our subarray.
* Slide a window over the array to maintain uniqueness.
* Maximize the score (sum of the subarray) as we go.

This naturally suggests using the **sliding window technique with a HashSet**.

---

# Approach:

1. Initialize:
   * A `Set` to track elements in the current window.
   * Two pointers (`left`, `right`) for the sliding window.
   * `currSum` for the current window’s sum.
   * `maxScore` for tracking the highest score.

2. Iterate over the array with `right`:
   * If `nums[right]` is **already in the set**, shrink the window from the left (`left++`) until it's removed from the set, and subtract from `currSum`.
   * Add `nums[right]` to the set and to `currSum`.
   * Update `maxScore` if `currSum` is greater.

3. Return `maxScore`.

# Complexity Analysis:

* **Time:** `O(n)` — Each element is added/removed from the set at most once.
* **Space:** `O(n)` — For the set that holds unique elements.

# Code:

```typescript
function maximumUniqueSubarray(nums: number[]): number {
    const seen = new Set<number>();
    let left = 0, right = 0;
    let currSum = 0, maxScore = 0;

    while (right < nums.length) {
        while (seen.has(nums[right])) {
            seen.delete(nums[left]);
            currSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }

        seen.add(nums[right]);
        currSum += nums[right];
        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currSum);
        right++;
    }

    return maxScore;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Example:**
Input: `nums = [4,2,4,5,6]`

Step-by-step:

* Start with `[]`, `currSum = 0`
* Add 4 → `[4]`, sum = 4
* Add 2 → `[4,2]`, sum = 6
* Add 4 → `4` is duplicate → remove `4` → `[2]`, sum = 2 → then add 4 → `[2,4]`, sum = 6
* Add 5 → `[2,4,5]`, sum = 11
* Add 6 → `[2,4,5,6]`, sum = 17

Return: `17`

**Final Answer:**

maximumUniqueSubarray([4,2,4,5,6])` returns `17
