[2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-bit-flips-to-convert-number/)

# Intuition:

To determine the minimum number of bit flips required to convert the binary representation of `start` to `goal`, we can leverage the XOR operation (`^`). The XOR of two numbers highlights the bits that differ between them, as it results in `1` for bits that are different and `0` for bits that are the same.

Once we have the XOR result, the problem reduces to counting how many `1`s are present in the XOR result, because each `1` represents a bit that needs to be flipped.

# Approach:

1. Compute the XOR of `start` and `goal`. This gives a number where each `1` indicates a differing bit.
2. Count the number of `1`s in the XOR result. Each `1` represents a necessary bit flip to convert `start` to `goal`.

### Steps:

1. Perform `start ^ goal` to get a number where each `1` represents a differing bit.
2. Use a function to count the number of `1`s in this XOR result. This can be done by repeatedly checking if the last bit is `1` and then right-shifting the number.

# Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where `n` is the number of bits in the larger of `start` or `goal`. In this case, `n` is bounded by the size of an integer, i.e., 32 bits.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of space.

# Code:

```typescript
function minBitFlips(start: number, goal: number): number {
    let xor = start ^ goal;
    
    let count = 0;
    
    while (xor > 0) {
        count += xor & 1;
        
        xor >>= 1;
    }
    
    return count;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **XOR Operation**: `start ^ goal` produces a number where each bit indicates whether the corresponding bits in `start` and `goal` are different. For example:
   - `start = 10 (1010)`
   - `goal = 7  (0111)`
   - `start ^ goal = 1010 ^ 0111 = 1101`

2. **Counting the Bits**: After the XOR operation, we count how many `1`s are in the result by iterating through each bit:
   - We use `xor & 1` to check the last bit and increment `count` if it's `1`.
   - We right shift `xor` by one bit (`xor >>= 1`) to move to the next bit.
   - We repeat this process until all bits are checked (i.e., `xor` becomes `0`).

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `start = 10`, `goal = 7`

1. `start = 1010`, `goal = 0111`
2. `start ^ goal = 1101`
3. Count the `1`s in `1101`:
   - Bit 1: `1`, increment `count` to 1.
   - Bit 2: `0`, `count` remains 1.
   - Bit 3: `1`, increment `count` to 2.
   - Bit 4: `1`, increment `count` to 3.
4. Return `3`, since there are 3 differing bits, requiring 3 flips.

#### Example 2:
Input: `start = 3`, `goal = 4`

1. `start = 011`, `goal = 100`
2. `start ^ goal = 111`
3. Count the `1`s in `111`:
   - Bit 1: `1`, increment `count` to 1.
   - Bit 2: `1`, increment `count` to 2.
   - Bit 3: `1`, increment `count` to 3.
4. Return `3`, since there are 3 differing bits, requiring 3 flips.

# Conclusion:

This approach efficiently calculates the minimum number of bit flips required to convert one integer to another by utilizing the XOR operation and counting the differing bits. It operates in ***O(log n)*** time complexity, where `n` is the number of bits in the integers, and uses constant space.
