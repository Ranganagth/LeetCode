[1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/)

# Intuition

The problem involves removing nodes from a binary tree and returning the roots of the resulting forest. The key to solving this problem is to traverse the tree, remove nodes as specified, and manage the creation of new roots for subtrees that become disjoint.

# Approach

1. **Set Up Data Structures**:
   - Use a set for the `to_delete` array for O(1) deletion checks.
   - Create an array to store the roots of the resulting forest.

2. **Recursive Traversal**:
   - Define a helper function that recursively traverses the tree.
   - For each node, check if it needs to be deleted:
     - If yes, add its left and right children (if they exist) to the forest's roots.
     - Return `null` to effectively remove the node from its parent.
   - If the node doesn't need to be deleted, recursively process its children and return the node itself.

3. **Manage the Root**:
   - If the initial root is not deleted, add it to the forest.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the recursion stack and the set containing nodes to delete.

# Code

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function delNodes(root: TreeNode | null, to_delete: number[]): (TreeNode | null)[] {
    const toDeleteSet = new Set(to_delete);
    const result: (TreeNode | null)[] = [];

    function helper(node: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
        if (!node) return null;

        node.left = helper(node.left);
        node.right = helper(node.right);

        if (toDeleteSet.has(node.val)) {
            if (node.left) result.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) result.push(node.right);
            return null;
        }
        return node;
    }

    if (helper(root)) {
        result.push(root);
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Example usage:
``` typescript
const root = new TreeNode(1, 
                new TreeNode(2, 
                    new TreeNode(4), 
                    new TreeNode(5)
                ), 
                new TreeNode(3, 
                    new TreeNode(6), 
                    new TreeNode(7)
                )
            );

const to_delete = [3, 5];
console.log(delNodes(root, to_delete)); // Output: [[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

### Explanation of Example Usage

- **Tree**: `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`
- **Nodes to delete**: `[3, 5]`

After deleting nodes `3` and `5`:
- Node `3` is deleted, its children `6` and `7` become new roots.
- Node `5` is deleted, and since it doesn't have children, there's no addition of new roots.

The remaining forest is:
- `[1,2,null,4]`
- `[6]`
- `[7]`

The function returns these trees as the result.
