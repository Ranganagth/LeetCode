[1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-k-th-lexicographical-string-of-all-happy-strings-of-length-n/)

# Intuition

The problem requires generating all valid "happy strings" of length `n` using only the characters `a, b, c`, ensuring that no two consecutive characters are the same. Then, we need to return the `k`-th string in lexicographical order.

- We can generate happy strings using **backtracking**, where at each step, we append a character (`a, b, c`) that is different from the last character added.
- Since we need the **k-th lexicographical string**, we can optimize by keeping count of generated strings and stopping early when we reach `k`.
- If there are fewer than `k` happy strings, return an empty string.

# Approach

1. **Backtracking to generate happy strings**:
    - Start with an empty string and recursively append characters.
    - Ensure that no two consecutive characters are the same.
    - Maintain a counter to track the number of valid happy strings found.
	
2. **Early stopping**:
    - Stop the recursion once we reach the `k`-th valid string.
	
3. **Lexicographical Order**:    
    - Since we try characters in order (`a → b → c`), the generated strings are already sorted lexicographically.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(3ⁿ)*** in the worst case since we generate all possible strings of length `n` with three choices at each position.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the recursive call stack.

# Code

```typescript
function getHappyString(n: number, k: number): string {
    const chars = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    let count = 0;
    let result = "";

    function backtrack(current: string) {
        if (current.length === n) {
            count++;
            if (count === k) {
                result = current;
            }
            return;
        }

        for (let ch of chars) {
            if (current.length === 0 || current[current.length - 1] !== ch) {
                backtrack(current + ch);
                if (result) return; // Stop early if we found the k-th string
            }
        }
    }

    backtrack("");
    return result;
};

```

## **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 1, k = 3
```

**Execution**:
1. The happy strings of length `1` are: `["a", "b", "c"]`.
2. The 3rd happy string is `"c"`.

**Output**:

```typescript
getHappyString(1, 3); // "c"
```

### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 1, k = 4
```

**Execution**:
1. The happy strings of length `1` are: `["a", "b", "c"]`.
2. There are only `3` happy strings, but `k = 4` is out of range.

**Output**:

```typescript
getHappyString(1, 4); // ""
```

### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
n = 3, k = 9
```

**Execution**:
1. The happy strings of length `3` are:
    
    ```
    ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]
    ```
    
2. The 9th happy string is `"cab"`.

**Output**:
```typescript
getHappyString(3, 9); // "cab"
```

---

## **Edge Cases Considered**

1. **Minimum input (`n = 1, k = 1`)**:
    - Output: `"a"` (only 3 possible strings, and k is within range).
	
2. **`k` exceeds total happy strings**:
    - If `k > 3 * 2⁽ⁿ⁻¹⁾`, return `""` immediately.
	
3. **Longest input (`n = 10`)**:
    - Since `3 * 2⁹ = 1536`, this is still feasible for backtracking.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Used **backtracking** to generate happy strings while ensuring lexicographical order.
- Used **early stopping** to improve efficiency when `k` is reached.
- Ensured **valid constraints** (return `""` when `k` is out of range).
