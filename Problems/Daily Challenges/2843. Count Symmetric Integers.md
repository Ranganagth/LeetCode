[2843. Count Symmetric Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-symmetric-integers/)

# Intuition

A number is **symmetric** if:
- It has an **even number of digits** (odd-length numbers are excluded).
- The **sum of the first half** of its digits is **equal to the sum of the second half**.    

Given a range `[low, high]`, we simply need to iterate through each number, filter out those with odd digit lengths, and check whether the number is symmetric based on the digit sums.

# Approach

1. Iterate over every integer `x` in the range `[low, high]`.
2. Convert `x` to a string to easily extract digits.
3. Skip if the number of digits is **odd**.
4. Split the string into **first half** and **second half**.
5. Calculate the **digit sum** of both halves.
6. If both sums match, increment the symmetric count.
7. Return the total count.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:  
    `O(N * D)` where `N = high - low + 1`, and `D` is the number of digits (at most 5, since `high ≤ 10^4`).
	
- **Space Complexity**:  
    `O(1)` extra space aside from constant-size operations.

# Code

```ts
function countSymmetricIntegers(low: number, high: number): number {
    let count = 0;

    for (let num = low; num <= high; num++) {
        const str = num.toString();
        const len = str.length;

        if (len % 2 !== 0) continue;

        const mid = len / 2;
        const left = str.slice(0, mid);
        const right = str.slice(mid);

        const sumDigits = (s: string) => s.split('').reduce((acc, digit) => acc + Number(digit), 0);

        if (sumDigits(left) === sumDigits(right)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

## **Example Walkthroughs**

### **Example 1**

```ts
Input: low = 1, high = 100
```

- Even-length numbers from 10 to 99: `11, 22, ..., 99`    
- Each has two digits, and both digits are equal → symmetric. → Total = **9**

### **Example 2**

```ts
Input: low = 1200, high = 1230
```

Check each number:

- `1203`: 12 | 03 → 1+2 = 3, 0+3 = 3 → symmetric
- `1212`: 1+2 = 3, 1+2 = 3 → symmetric
- `1221`: 1+2 = 3, 2+1 = 3 → symmetric
- `1230`: 1+2 = 3, 3+0 = 3 → symmetric    

→ Total = **4**

## **Summary**

This problem is solved effectively using a simple iteration and string-based digit processing. The constraints are small, so a direct and intuitive approach is efficient and easy to implement.
