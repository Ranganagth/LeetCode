[2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-a-string-into-groups-of-size-k/)

### Problem Summary

You are given:

* A string `s`
* A group size `k`
* A character `fill`

You must:

* Split `s` into substrings of size `k`
* If the final group has fewer than `k` characters, **append** `fill` to complete it
* Return an array of these groups

---

# Intuition

We're grouping the string in chunks of `k`. If the last group is incomplete, we pad it with the given `fill` character. This ensures:

* All groups are of size `k`
* The combined result (after removing fills) equals the original string

---

# Approach

1. Initialize an empty array `result`
2. Iterate over the string in steps of `k`
3. Slice a group of size `k` starting from the current index
4. If the last group is less than `k`, pad it with `fill` characters
5. Push each group into the `result`
6. Return the `result`

---
# Complexity

* **Time:** O(n), where `n = s.length` (each character processed once)
* **Space:** O(n), for the result array and temporary strings

---

# Code

```ts
function divideString(s: string, k: number, fill: string): string[] {
    const result: string[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i += k) {
        let group = s.slice(i, i + k);
        if (group.length < k) {
            group = group + fill.repeat(k - group.length);
        }
        result.push(group);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

```ts
Input: s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"
```

Groups:

* "abc"
* "def"
* "ghi"

All complete, so output: `["abc", "def", "ghi"]`

#### Example 2:

```ts
Input: s = "abcdefghij", k = 3, fill = "x"
```

Groups:

* "abc"
* "def"
* "ghi"
* "j" → not complete → "jxx"

Output: `["abc", "def", "ghi", "jxx"]`
