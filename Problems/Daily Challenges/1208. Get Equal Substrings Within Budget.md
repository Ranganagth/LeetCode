[1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/)


# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum length of a substring where the total cost to convert string `s` to string `t` is less than or equal to `maxCost`. The cost is calculated based on the absolute difference in ASCII values of corresponding characters. A sliding window approach is a suitable method for solving this type of problem, as it allows us to efficiently calculate the cost for each potential substring.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window of substring being considered.
2. Calculate the cost of converting `s[start..end]` to `t[start..end]`.
3. If the total cost exceeds `maxCost`, move the `start` pointer to the right until the cost is less than or equal to `maxCost`.
4. Keep track of the maximum length of any valid substring encountered during this process.

# Explanation
- Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both set to 0, and a variable `totalCost` to store the current conversion cost.
- Iterate over the string with the `end` pointer, expanding the window.
- For each new character added to the window, update `totalCost` by adding the conversion cost of the new character.
- If `totalCost` exceeds `maxCost`, increment the `start` pointer to shrink the window until `totalCost` is within `maxCost`.
- Track the maximum length of the window where `totalCost` is within `maxCost`.
- Return the maximum length found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. Each character is processed at most twice, once when expanding the window and once when contracting it.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```TypeScript
function equalSubstring(s: string, t: string, maxCost: number): number {
    let start = 0;
    let totalCost = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
        totalCost += Math.abs(s.charCodeAt(end) - t.charCodeAt(end));

        while (totalCost > maxCost) {
            totalCost -= Math.abs(s.charCodeAt(start) - t.charCodeAt(start));
            start++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
};

```
