[11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

# Intuition
To find the container that holds the most water, the key observation is that the width of the container is determined by the distance between the two lines, and the height is determined by the shorter line of the two. To maximize the area, we need to consider both width and height efficiently.

# Approach
1. Use two pointers, one starting from the left end and the other from the right end of the array.
2. Calculate the area formed between the two pointers.
3. Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, as moving the taller line would not help in finding a larger area.
4. Keep track of the maximum area found during the process.

# Explanation
1. Initialize `left` pointer at the beginning (index 0) and `right` pointer at the end (index n-1) of the array.
2. While `left` is less than `right`:
   - Calculate the height of the container as the minimum of the heights at the two pointers.
   - Calculate the width of the container as the difference between the indices of the two pointers.
   - Calculate the area of the container and update the maximum area if the current area is larger.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward (increment `left` if the height at `left` is less, otherwise decrement `right`).
3. Return the maximum area found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***
  - We only traverse the array once with two pointers, resulting in linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: ***O(1)***
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function maxArea(height: number[]): number {
    let maxArea = 0;
    let left = 0, right = height.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        const h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        const w = right - left;
        maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * w);

        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
};
