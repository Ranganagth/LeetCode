[409. Longest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome/)

# Intuition

1. **Palindrome Properties**:
   - A palindrome reads the same forward and backward.
   - The characters in a palindrome can either be paired or a single middle character in the case of an odd length palindrome.

2. **Character Frequencies**:
   - If a character appears an even number of times, all occurrences of that character can be used to form a palindrome.
   - If a character appears an odd number of times, all but one occurrence of that character can be used to form pairs in the palindrome. One occurrence can potentially be the middle character.

# Approach

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency map to count the occurrences of each character.
2. **Calculate Palindrome Length**:
   - Initialize a variable to store the length of the longest palindrome.
   - Track if there's any character with an odd frequency.
   - Iterate through the frequency map:
     - For characters with even frequencies, add the entire frequency to the palindrome length.
     - For characters with odd frequencies, add the largest even number less than the frequency (i.e., `freq - 1`) to the palindrome length, and mark that there is an odd frequency character.
   - If there is at least one character with an odd frequency, add 1 to the length to account for the middle character.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the string `s`, since we iterate through the string to build the frequency map and then iterate through the map.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since the size of the frequency map is limited to the number of distinct characters (52 for lowercase and uppercase English letters).

# Code
```typescript
function longestPalindrome(s: string): number {
    const charCount: { [key: string]: number } = {};
    
    ​for (const char of s) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
    }
    
    let length = 0;
    let hasOddFrequency = false;
    
    ​for (const count of Object.values(charCount)) {
        if (count % 2 === 0) {
            length += count;
        } else {
            length += count - 1;
            hasOddFrequency = true;
        }
    }
    
    if (hasOddFrequency) {
        length += 1;
    }
    
    return length;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Map Construction**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string `s` and build a frequency map.
   
2. **Palindrome Length Calculation**:
   - Initialize `length` to 0 and `hasOddFrequency` to false.
   - Iterate through the character counts in the frequency map:
     - Add the count to `length` if it's even.
     - Add `count - 1` to `length` if it's odd and set `hasOddFrequency` to true.
   - If any character has an odd frequency, increment `length` by 1 to account for the middle character in the palindrome.
