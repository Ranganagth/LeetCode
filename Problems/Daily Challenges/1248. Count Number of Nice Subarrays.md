[1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window approach. The idea is to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers and count the number of subarrays that can be formed within that window. 

# Approach

1. **Identify Odd Numbers**: Iterate through the array and identify the positions of the odd numbers.
2. **Two Pointers Technique**: Use two pointers to maintain a sliding window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers.
3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window, count the number of subarrays that can be formed by extending the window from both ends.
4. **Sum Up the Results**: Sum the counts of all valid subarrays to get the final result.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Find Positions of Odd Numbers**: First, we need to identify the positions of the odd numbers in the array.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` odd numbers. Adjust the window size as you iterate through the array.
3. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid window, count how many subarrays can be formed. This is done by calculating the number of ways to extend the window from both ends.
4. **Sum Up**: Sum up the counts from all valid windows to get the final result.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the length of the array. This is because we are processing each element of the array at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```typescript
function numberOfSubarrays(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    let start = 0, end = 0;
    let count = 0, oddCount = 0, result = 0;
    
    while (end < n) {
        if (nums[end] % 2 === 1) {
            oddCount++;
            count = 0;
        }
        
        while (oddCount === k) {
            if (nums[start] % 2 === 1) {
                oddCount--;
            }
            start++;
            count++;
        }
        
        result += count;
        end++;
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We initialize `start`, `end`, `count`, `oddCount`, and `result` to manage the window and count subarrays.
2. **Expand the Window**: As we iterate with `end`, we count the number of odd numbers.
3. **Contract the Window**: When the window has exactly `k` odd numbers, we try to shrink it from the left (`start`) while keeping track of the number of valid subarrays.
4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: We add the number of valid subarrays formed by the current window to `result`.
5. **Final Result**: The final result is stored in `result` which we return after the loop ends.
