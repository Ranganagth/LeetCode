[1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-1s-are-at-least-length-k-places-away/)

# Intuition

Each `1` imposes a distance requirement: the next `1` must appear **at least k indices later**.
So the task is simply checking gaps between consecutive `1`s in the array.
We track the index of the previous `1` and verify that the difference is ≥ `k + 1`.

---

# Approach

1. Maintain `prev = -1` to store the index of the last seen `1`.
2. Scan the array:

   * When you find a `1`:

     * If `prev != -1` and `(i - prev - 1) < k`, return `false`.
     * Update `prev = i`.
3. If the scan completes, return `true`.

# Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

---

# Code

```typescript
function kLengthApart(nums: number[], k: number): boolean {
    let prev = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            if (prev !== -1 && i - prev - 1 < k) {
                return false;
            }
            prev = i;
        }
    }

    return true;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2

* First `1` at index 0 → prev=0
* Next `1` at index 4 → gap = 4 – 0 – 1 = 3 ≥ 2 → ok
* Next `1` at index 7 → gap = 7 – 4 – 1 = 2 ≥ 2 → ok

Result: **true**

### Example 2

nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2

* First `1` at index 0
* Next `1` at index 3 → gap = 3 – 0 – 1 = 2 ≥ 2 → ok
* Next `1` at index 5 → gap = 5 – 3 – 1 = 1 < 2 → violates rule

Result: **false**
