[2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to construct a binary tree from a list of parent-child relationships. The key steps involve identifying the root of the tree and building the tree structure accordingly.

# Approach

1. **Create Nodes**:
   - Create a map to store each node. Each key in the map will be a value, and the value will be a TreeNode.

2. **Track Parents and Children**:
   - Use a set to track all child nodes. This will help us identify the root node, as the root node is the only node that is never a child.

3. **Build the Tree**:
   - Iterate through the descriptions to populate the nodes and establish parent-child relationships.

4. **Identify the Root**:
   - The root node is the node that is not present in the set of child nodes.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of descriptions. Each description is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the nodes and the set of child nodes.

### Code in TypeScript

```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null = null;
    right: TreeNode | null = null;
    constructor(val: number) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}

function createBinaryTree(descriptions: number[][]): TreeNode | null {
    const nodes = new Map<number, TreeNode>();
    const children = new Set<number>();

    for (const [parent, child, isLeft] of descriptions) {
        if (!nodes.has(parent)) {
            nodes.set(parent, new TreeNode(parent));
        }
        if (!nodes.has(child)) {
            nodes.set(child, new TreeNode(child));
        }
        const parentNode = nodes.get(parent)!;
        const childNode = nodes.get(child)!;

        if (isLeft === 1) {
            parentNode.left = childNode;
        } else {
            parentNode.right = childNode;
        }
        children.add(child);
    }

    for (const [parent] of descriptions) {
        if (!children.has(parent)) {
            return nodes.get(parent)!;
        }
    }

    return null;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Represents a node in the binary tree.

2. **createBinaryTree Function**:
   - Uses a map to store nodes and a set to keep track of child nodes.
   - Iterates through the descriptions to build the tree.
   - Identifies the root node by finding the node that is not a child.
