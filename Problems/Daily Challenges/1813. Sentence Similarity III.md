[1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-iii/)

# Intuition

We are given two sentences, `sentence1` and `sentence2`. We need to determine if we can make one sentence equal to the other by inserting an arbitrary number of words (possibly empty) in one of the sentences. The inserted words must be between the existing words and separated by spaces.

This problem can be thought of as identifying whether one sentence can be "expanded" by inserting words into the other sentence, maintaining the same sequence for the remaining words.

### Key Observations

1. **Matching Words at the Beginning and End**:
   - The sentences can be considered similar if they share a common prefix and a common suffix, and we can insert words between them to make them equal.
   - For example, if `sentence1` starts and ends with the same words as `sentence2` (or vice versa), the words in between can be inserted or removed.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - We can start by comparing the words from both the beginning (prefix) and the end (suffix) of both sentences.
   - If the remaining middle portion (if any) is empty in either sentence, they are similar.

# Approach

1. **Split Sentences**:
   - Split both `sentence1` and `sentence2` into arrays of words.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Comparison**:
   - Use two pointers: one starting from the beginning (`left`) and one starting from the end (`right`).
   - Compare the words at the beginning of both sentences until they mismatch or one pointer reaches the end of one of the sentences.
   - Do the same for the words at the end of the sentences, moving inward.
   
3. **Final Check**:
   - After matching from both ends, the words left in the middle should either match exactly, or one of the sentences should be completely traversed (i.e., empty).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `sentence1` and `sentence2`, respectively. We need to split each sentence into words and compare them.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the split arrays.

# Code:

```typescript
function areSentencesSimilar(sentence1: string, sentence2: string): boolean {
    const words1 = sentence1.split(" ");
    const words2 = sentence2.split(" ");
    
    let left = 0;
    let right1 = words1.length - 1;
    let right2 = words2.length - 1;
    
    while (left < words1.length && left < words2.length && words1[left] === words2[left]) {
        left++;
    }
    
    while (right1 >= left && right2 >= left && words1[right1] === words2[right2]) {
        right1--;
        right2--;
    }
    
    return left > right1 || left > right2;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Splitting the Sentences**:
   - We split both `sentence1` and `sentence2` into arrays of words using `split(" ")`.

2. **Matching Prefix**:
   - We start comparing the words from the beginning of both sentences using the `left` pointer, incrementing it as long as the words match.

3. **Matching Suffix**:
   - We also compare the words from the end of both sentences using the `right1` and `right2` pointers, decrementing them as long as the words match.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After matching both the prefix and suffix, we check if the middle portion of the words (if any) between `left` and `right` has been completely matched or if one of the sentences is fully traversed. If so, the sentences are similar.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `sentence1 = "My name is Haley"`, `sentence2 = "My Haley"`
  
  1. **Splitting**:
     - `words1 = ["My", "name", "is", "Haley"]`
     - `words2 = ["My", "Haley"]`
  
  2. **Prefix Match**:
     - `left = 0`: `words1[0] === words2[0]` ("My" === "My")
     - Increment `left` to 1.
  
  3. **Suffix Match**:
     - `right1 = 3`, `right2 = 1`: `words1[3] === words2[1]` ("Haley" === "Haley")
     - Decrement `right1` to 2, `right2` to 0.
  
  4. **Final Check**:
     - We have matched all the words from the prefix and suffix, so the sentences are similar.
  
  - **Output**: `true`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `sentence1 = "of"`, `sentence2 = "A lot of words"`
  
  1. **Splitting**:
     - `words1 = ["of"]`
     - `words2 = ["A", "lot", "of", "words"]`
  
  2. **Prefix Match**:
     - `left = 0`: `words1[0] !== words2[0]` ("of" !== "A")
     - No match from the beginning.
  
  3. **Suffix Match**:
     - `right1 = 0`, `right2 = 3`: `words1[0] === words2[2]` ("of" === "of")
     - Decrement `right2` to 1, `right1` becomes -1.
  
  4. **Final Check**:
     - We have words remaining in `words2`, and `words1` has no matching prefix.
  
  - **Output**: `false`

#### Example 3:
- **Input**: `sentence1 = "Eating right now"`, `sentence2 = "Eating"`
  
  1. **Splitting**:
     - `words1 = ["Eating", "right", "now"]`
     - `words2 = ["Eating"]`
  
  2. **Prefix Match**:
     - `left = 0`: `words1[0] === words2[0]` ("Eating" === "Eating")
     - Increment `left` to 1.
  
  3. **Suffix Match**:
     - No suffix to match as `sentence2` has no more words.
  
  4. **Final Check**:
     - The middle portion of `sentence1` is `"right now"`, which can be inserted after `"Eating"` in `sentence2`, making the sentences similar.
  
  - **Output**: `true`

### Conclusion

By comparing the prefix and suffix of both sentences using a sliding window approach, we can efficiently determine if one sentence can be transformed into the other by inserting words. The time complexity is ***O(n + m)***, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of the two sentences, and this solution handles the problem in linear time with minimal space overhead.
