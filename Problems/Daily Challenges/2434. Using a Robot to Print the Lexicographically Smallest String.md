[2434. Using a Robot to Print the Lexicographically Smallest String](https://leetcode.com/problems/using-a-robot-to-print-the-lexicographically-smallest-string/)

# Problem

You're given a string `s` and a robot that starts with an empty string `t`. You can:

1. **Move the first character from `s` to the end of `t`**.
2. **Pop the last character from `t` and write it to a final string `p`**.

You must perform operations such that **both `s` and `t` end up empty**, and your goal is to **return the lexicographically smallest string `p`** that could be produced.

# Intuition

We want to simulate a process where:

* At each point, we decide whether to **move a character from `s` to `t`**, or
* **Pop from `t` and add to the output `p`**, based on which option helps us reach the **smallest lexicographic output**.

To decide **when to pop from `t`**, we need to ensure that the character at the end of `t` is **less than or equal to the smallest remaining character in `s`**.
If it is, we should pop from `t` and add to `p`. Otherwise, we continue moving characters from `s` to `t`.

To support fast lookup of the smallest remaining character in `s`, we **precompute the suffix minimum characters** of `s`.

# Approach

1. Precompute an array `minCharFromIndex` where `minCharFromIndex[i]` is the smallest character from `s[i:]`.
2. Use a stack `t` to simulate the robot's internal string.
3. Iterate through `s`:

   * At each step, move the first character from `s` to `t`.
   * Then while the top of `t` is smaller or equal to the smallest remaining character in `s`, pop from `t` and add to result.
4. After `s` is empty, flush the remaining characters from `t` to `p`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `s` (each character is processed once).
* **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack and result.

# Code

```typescript
function robotWithString(s: string): string {
    const n = s.length;
    const minCharFromIndex: string[] = new Array(n);
    minCharFromIndex[n - 1] = s[n - 1];

    // Step 1: Build suffix minimum character array
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        minCharFromIndex[i] = s[i] < minCharFromIndex[i + 1] ? s[i] : minCharFromIndex[i + 1];
    }

    const t: string[] = [];
    const result: string[] = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        t.push(s[i]);

        // Step 2: Pop from t to result if it's <= remaining min char in s
        while (
            t.length > 0 &&
            (i === n - 1 || t[t.length - 1] <= minCharFromIndex[i + 1])
        ) {
            result.push(t.pop()!);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Empty remaining stack
    while (t.length > 0) {
        result.push(t.pop()!);
    }

    return result.join('');
};

```

### **Examples and Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1:**

```ts
Input: s = "zza"
```

* `minCharFromIndex = ['a', 'a', 'a']`
* Move all chars to `t`: `t = ['z', 'z', 'a']`
* Start popping: pop 'a', then 'z', then 'z'
* **Output:** `"azz"`

#### **Example 2:**

```ts
Input: s = "bac"
```

* `minCharFromIndex = ['a', 'a', 'c']`
* Move 'b' → t = \['b'], can't pop (b > 'a')
* Move 'a' → t = \['b', 'a'], pop 'a'
* Now min = 'c', and top of t is 'b' < 'c', pop 'b'
* Move 'c' → t = \['c'], pop 'c'
* **Output:** `"abc"`

#### **Example 3:**

```ts
Input: s = "bdda"
```

* `minCharFromIndex = ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a']`
* Push all to `t`: \['b', 'd', 'd', 'a']
* Start popping when possible: pop 'a', then nothing smaller left, pop 'd', 'd', 'b'
* **Output:** `"addb"`

### **Summary:**

This greedy approach with a stack and suffix-min tracking helps us always decide when to pop to produce the smallest lexicographical result efficiently.
