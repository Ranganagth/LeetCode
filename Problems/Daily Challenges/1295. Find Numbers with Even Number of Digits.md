[1295. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-numbers-with-even-number-of-digits/)

# Intuition

To determine how many numbers in the array contain an **even number of digits**, we can leverage the fact that converting a number to a string allows easy counting of its digits.

# Approach

1. Loop through each number in the array.
2. Convert the number to a string and check the length.
3. If the length (i.e., number of digits) is even, increment a counter.
4. Return the final count.

This method is simple and effective because:
- String conversion is direct and avoids repeated division.
- Works well within given constraints (`nums.length <= 500`).

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (excluding input and output), since we're only using a counter.

# Code

```ts
function findNumbers(nums: number[]): number {
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        const digits = num.toString().length;
        if (digits % 2 === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**: `nums = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]`

- `12` → 2 digits → even → count = 1
- `345` → 3 digits → odd
- `2` → 1 digit → odd
- `6` → 1 digit → odd
- `7896` → 4 digits → even → count = 2

**Output**: `2`

#### **Example 2**

**Input**: `nums = [555, 901, 482, 1771]`

- `555` → 3 digits → odd
- `901` → 3 digits → odd
- `482` → 3 digits → odd
- `1771` → 4 digits → even → count = 1

**Output**: `1`

### **Summary**

This problem is best solved with a direct and readable approach using string conversion. It ensures accuracy with minimal code and is highly efficient for the input constraints.
