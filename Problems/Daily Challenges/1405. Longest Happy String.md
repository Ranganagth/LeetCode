[1405. Longest Happy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-happy-string/)

# Intuition:

The goal is to construct the longest "happy" string under the given conditions:
1. The string can only contain 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. It must not contain the substrings "aaa", "bbb", or "ccc".
3. We are limited by the given counts `a`, `b`, and `c` for how many times we can use 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively.

### Key Observations:

- To form the longest string, we should **try to use the letter with the highest count** as often as possible.
- However, we must ensure that **no letter appears three times consecutively**. If the most frequent letter has already been used twice consecutively, we need to insert one of the other letters.
- The process involves dynamically deciding which letter to add next based on current counts, while ensuring we don’t break the “no triple consecutive letters” rule.

# Approach:

1. **Greedy Strategy**:
   - Always try to append the letter with the largest count (among 'a', 'b', or 'c').
   - If this letter was used twice in a row, switch to the second-most frequent letter.
   
2. **Control Adding Letters**:
   - Maintain a count of how many times each letter ('a', 'b', 'c') can still be used.
   - Always check if adding the most frequent letter would cause a violation of the "no triple consecutive letters" rule. If so, add the next most frequent letter.

3. **Terminate**:
   - If none of the letters can be added without violating the rules, stop the process and return the current string.

4. **Sorting by Count**:
   - At each step, sort the letters by their remaining count, so you can always attempt to add the most frequent one that doesn’t break the rule.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(a + b + c)***, where *a*, *b*, and *c* are the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. In each step, we decide which letter to add in constant time and we can only add a letter a total of *a + b + c* times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(a + b + c)*** for storing the final string.

# Code:

```typescript
function longestHappyString(a: number, b: number, c: number): string {
    let heap: [string, number][] = [['a', a], ['b', b], ['c', c]];
    
    let result: string[] = [];
    
    function sortHeap() {
        heap.sort((x, y) => y[1] - x[1]);
    }

    while (true) {
        sortHeap();
        
        const [firstChar, firstCount] = heap[0];
        
        const [secondChar, secondCount] = heap[1];
        
        if (firstCount > 0) {
            const n = result.length;
            
            if (n >= 2 && result[n - 1] === firstChar && result[n - 2] === firstChar) {
                if (secondCount === 0) {
                    break;
                }
                result.push(secondChar);
                heap[1][1]--;
            } else {
                result.push(firstChar);
                heap[0][1]--;
            }
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return result.join('');
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - We start by creating a list called `heap` that contains tuples of each letter ('a', 'b', 'c') along with their respective counts (`a`, `b`, `c`).
   
2. **Sorting the Heap**:
   - We define a function `sortHeap` to sort the heap in descending order by the remaining count of each letter. This ensures that at each step, we can easily pick the letter with the highest count.

3. **Building the Result**:
   - We loop until we can no longer add letters to the result string. 
   - At each step, we attempt to add the letter with the highest count (`firstChar`). If adding this letter would create three consecutive same letters, we instead add the letter with the second-highest count (`secondChar`).
   - After adding a letter, we decrease its count and continue.

4. **Stopping Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when no more letters can be added (either all counts are 0 or adding any letter would violate the "no triple consecutive letters" rule).

5. **Return the Result**:
   - We join the result array into a string and return it.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 7`

- Initial counts: `a: 1, b: 1, c: 7`.
- First, we try to add 'c' since it has the largest count. After adding 'c' twice, the count of 'c' becomes 5.
- Next, we add 'a' or 'b' to avoid three consecutive 'c's. Let's say we add 'a'.
- After this, we can again add 'c' twice and then add 'b' once.
- Continue this process until no more letters can be added.

**Output**: `"ccaccbcc"` or `"ccbccacc"`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `a = 7, b = 1, c = 0`

- Initial counts: `a: 7, b: 1, c: 0`.
- We can add 'a' twice, then add 'b' to avoid three consecutive 'a's. Repeat this process.

**Output**: `"aabaa"`

### Final Notes:
- The algorithm builds the string in a greedy manner, always attempting to use the letter with the largest count while respecting the rules.
- Sorting at each step ensures that the letter selection is optimal. This results in the longest possible "happy" string.
