[909. Snakes and Ladders](https://leetcode.com/problems/snakes-and-ladders/)

# Intuition  
The problem is a variation of the classic **Snakes and Ladders** game on a 2D board. The goal is to find the **minimum number of dice rolls** needed to reach the last cell $n^2$ from cell `1`.

Because dice rolls define possible transitions (up to 6 positions forward) and there are **teleportations** via snakes and ladders, this becomes a **shortest path problem** in an unweighted graph, where:
- Each square is a node
- Each dice roll is an edge to a neighbor
- Snakes/ladders are immediate redirects

This is best solved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** starting from square `1`.

# Approach

1. **Flatten the Board**:  
   Convert the 2D board to a 1D array `flattenedBoard` of size $n^2 + 1$, where each index represents a square number. This helps simulate movement linearly while considering Boustrophedon layout.

2. **Boustrophedon Mapping**:  
   Rows alternate direction:
   - Even rows: left to right
   - Odd rows: right to left
   Calculate square number `s` → `(row, col)` and vice versa.

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Initialize a queue with square `1`.
   - At each step, for current square `s`, roll dice to move to `s + 1` through `s + 6`.
   - Check if destination square has a snake or ladder: if `board[i][j] != -1`, teleport to that value.
   - Mark visited squares to prevent revisits.
   - Return the level (number of dice rolls) once you reach $n^2$.

4. **Return -1 if Unreachable**

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2)$
  Each node (square) is visited once, and we check up to 6 neighbors.

- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$  
  Used for the visited array and queue in BFS.

# Code

```ts
function snakesAndLadders(board: number[][]): number {
    const n = board.length;

    const getCoordinates = (s: number): [number, number] => {
        const quot = Math.floor((s - 1) / n);
        const rem = (s - 1) % n;
        const row = n - 1 - quot;
        const col = quot % 2 === 0 ? rem : n - 1 - rem;
        return [row, col];
    };

    const visited = new Array(n * n + 1).fill(false);
    const queue: [number, number][] = [[1, 0]]; // [square, moves]
    visited[1] = true;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [curr, moves] = queue.shift()!;
        for (let next = curr + 1; next <= Math.min(curr + 6, n * n); next++) {
            const [r, c] = getCoordinates(next);
            const dest = board[r][c] !== -1 ? board[r][c] : next;
            if (!visited[dest]) {
                if (dest === n * n) return moves + 1;
                visited[dest] = true;
                queue.push([dest, moves + 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**:
```ts
Input:
board = [
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,35,-1,-1,13,-1],
  [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],
  [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]
]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation**:
- Start at square 1 (bottom-left).
- First move: roll 1 → square 2 → ladder to 15
- Second move: roll 2 → square 17 → snake to 13
- Third move: roll 1 → square 14 → ladder to 35
- Fourth move: roll 1 → square 36 $(n^2)$

Reached in **4 moves**

#### **Example 2**:
```ts
Input: board = [[-1,-1],[-1,3]]
Output: 1
```

**Explanation**:
- Start at square 1.
- Roll 1 → square 2 → ladder to 3

Reached in **1 move**

### **Summary**

By simulating the game as a shortest path problem using BFS, and correctly mapping the 2D Boustrophedon layout into a 1D index system, we efficiently find the minimum number of dice rolls to reach the end of the board.
