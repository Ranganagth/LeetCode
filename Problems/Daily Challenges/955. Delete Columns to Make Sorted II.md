[955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii/)

# Intuition

We want the *rows* (`strs[0] <= strs[1] <= ...`) to be lexicographically sorted **after deleting some columns**.

Key observation:
Lexicographic order is decided **left to right**.
Once two rows differ at some column and are already in correct order, later columns do not matter for that pair.

So:
* Process columns from left to right.
* Track which adjacent row pairs are **already confirmed sorted**.
* If a column breaks ordering for any *unsorted* pair, that column **must be deleted**.
* Otherwise, keep the column and mark pairs that become sorted due to it.

This greedy strategy is optimal.

# Approach

1. Let `n = number of strings`, `m = length of each string`.
2. Maintain a boolean array `sorted[i]` meaning:
   * `strs[i] < strs[i+1]` is already guaranteed from previous columns.
3. Initialize all `sorted[i] = false`.
4. For each column `c` from `0` to `m-1`:
   * Check if this column violates order for any `i` where `sorted[i] == false`:
     * If `strs[i][c] > strs[i+1][c]`, the column must be deleted.
   * If deleted → increment answer, skip column.
   * Else:
     * Update `sorted[i] = true` where `strs[i][c] < strs[i+1][c]`.
5. Return number of deleted columns.

## Why this works

* Once a pair is strictly ordered, future columns cannot undo it.
* We only delete a column if keeping it makes ordering impossible.
* This minimizes deletions.

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n * m)`
* **Space:** `O(n)`

# Code

```ts
function minDeletionSize(strs: string[]): number {
    const n = strs.length;
    const m = strs[0].length;
    const sorted: boolean[] = new Array(n - 1).fill(false);
    let deletions = 0;

    for (let col = 0; col < m; col++) {
        let bad = false;

        for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (!sorted[i] && strs[i][col] > strs[i + 1][col]) {
                bad = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (bad) {
            deletions++;
            continue;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (!sorted[i] && strs[i][col] < strs[i + 1][col]) {
                sorted[i] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return deletions;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**

```
strs = ["ca","bb","ac"]

Column 0:
c > b → bad → delete (deletions = 1)

Column 1:
a < b → sorted[0] = true
b < c → sorted[1] = true

All rows ordered.
```

**Output:** `1`

---

**Example 2**

```
strs = ["zyx","wvu","tsr"]

Column 0: z > w → delete
Column 1: y > v → delete
Column 2: x > r → delete
```

**Output:** `3`

## Key Insight

This is **not** column-wise sorting.
It is **row lexicographic ordering with greedy column validation**.
