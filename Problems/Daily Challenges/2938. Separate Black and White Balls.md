[2938. Separate Black and White Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/separate-black-and-white-balls/)

# Intuition:

The challenge is to find the minimum number of steps required to move all black balls ('1's) to the right, without changing the relative order of '1's. We want to minimize the number of swaps needed to achieve this.

### Key Observations:
1. The order of '1's must remain the same â€” meaning, you can't simply count how many '1's are present and move them without considering their original position.
2. Every '1' that appears out of place (i.e., on the left side of some '0's) will need to be swapped with '0's to bring it to the correct position.
3. We only need to calculate how far each '1' has to move to its final position and count the necessary swaps.

# Approach:

1. **Iterate from right to left**: 
   - Move from the end of the string towards the beginning.
   - For every '1' we encounter, we want to calculate how many steps are needed to move that '1' to the end while taking into account the '1's that have already been encountered.
   
2. **Steps Calculation**:
   - As we move through the string, for each '1' encountered, we count how many '1's have already been processed.
   - For each '1', the number of steps required is `(length of the string - current position of '1' - count of 1s processed so far)`. This calculates how many positions the current '1' needs to move right, ignoring the positions already occupied by other '1's.
   
3. **Counting the swaps**:
   - Accumulate the number of swaps required as you process each '1'.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the string. We iterate through the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a few variables (constant space).

# Code:

```typescript
function minimumSteps(s: string): number {
    const stringLength = s.length;
    let steps = 0;
    let countOfOnes = 0;
    
	for (let i = stringLength - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            ++countOfOnes;
            steps += stringLength - i - countOfOnes;
        }
    }

    return steps;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `steps`: Tracks the total number of swaps.
   - `countOfOnes`: Keeps track of how many '1's we have encountered while iterating over the string from right to left.

2. **Iterate in Reverse**:
   - We iterate the string from right to left. For every '1' we encounter, we know that it needs to be moved to the right of all previously encountered '1's.
   - For each '1', we calculate how many positions it needs to move by subtracting its position from the length of the string and adjusting for how many '1's have already been moved.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After the loop completes, `steps` will contain the total number of swaps needed to group all black balls ('1's) to the right.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `s = "101"`

- Start iterating from the right:
  - `i = 2`, `s[2] = '1'`: 
    - `countOfOnes = 1` (first '1' encountered).
    - Steps: `3 - 2 - 1 = 0` (no move needed since it is already at the end).
  - `i = 1`, `s[1] = '0'`: Skip, since it's a white ball.
  - `i = 0`, `s[0] = '1'`:
    - `countOfOnes = 2` (second '1' encountered).
    - Steps: `3 - 0 - 2 = 1` (this '1' needs to move 1 step right).
    
**Total Steps**: `1`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `s = "100"`

- Start iterating from the right:
  - `i = 2`, `s[2] = '0'`: Skip.
  - `i = 1`, `s[1] = '0'`: Skip.
  - `i = 0`, `s[0] = '1'`: 
    - `countOfOnes = 1`.
    - Steps: `3 - 0 - 1 = 2` (this '1' needs to move 2 steps right).

**Total Steps**: `2`

#### Example 3:
**Input**: `s = "0111"`

- Start iterating from the right:
  - `i = 3`, `s[3] = '1'`: 
    - `countOfOnes = 1`.
    - Steps: `4 - 3 - 1 = 0` (no move needed).
  - `i = 2`, `s[2] = '1'`: 
    - `countOfOnes = 2`.
    - Steps: `4 - 2 - 2 = 0` (no move needed).
  - `i = 1`, `s[1] = '1'`: 
    - `countOfOnes = 3`.
    - Steps: `4 - 1 - 3 = 0` (no move needed).
  - `i = 0`, `s[0] = '0'`: Skip.

**Total Steps**: `0`

### Final Notes:

- The solution efficiently counts the minimum number of adjacent swaps required by considering how far each '1' must be moved to the right, ignoring '1's that are already processed.
- This avoids an ***O(n^2)*** solution and reduces the problem to linear complexity ***O(n)***.
