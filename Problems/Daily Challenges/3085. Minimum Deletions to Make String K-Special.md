[3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-k-special/)

# Intuition

If we know how many times each character appears, our job is to remove just enough characters so that all frequencies fall within a **window of size `k`**.

Let’s say we decide the **target frequency `f`** that we want most characters to be close to. Then, for every character:

* If its frequency is **too high**, we delete the excess.
* If its frequency is **too low**, we might ignore it or delete the character entirely if it's outside the acceptable `[f, f + k]` range.

We try every `f` from the **minimum frequency** to the **maximum frequency**, and for each `f`, calculate how many deletions are needed to make all frequencies lie within `[f, f + k]`.

---

# Approach

1. Count the frequency of each character in the word.
2. Create a sorted list of these frequencies.
3. For each possible base frequency `f`:

   * Keep characters with frequency in `[f, f + k]`
   * For characters with frequency < `f`, **delete them all**
   * For characters with frequency > `f + k`, **delete the excess**
4. Track the minimum total deletions across all `f`.

# Complexity

* **Time:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is number of unique characters (max 26), so it's effectively **constant**.
* **Space:** `O(1)` (only stores frequency of 26 letters)

# Code

```ts
function minimumDeletions(word: string, k: number): number {
    const freq: Record<string, number> = {};
    
    // Step 1: Count frequencies
    for (const char of word) {
        freq[char] = (freq[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    const freqList = Object.values(freq).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let minDeletions = Infinity;

    const n = freqList.length;
    const totalFreqSum = freqList.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x, 0);

    // Step 2: Try each base frequency as lower bound
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const low = freqList[i];
        const high = low + k;

        let deletions = 0;

        // Characters with freq < low: delete them completely
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            deletions += freqList[j];
        }

        // Characters with freq > high: delete excess part
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            if (freqList[j] > high) {
                deletions += freqList[j] - high;
            }
        }

        minDeletions = Math.min(minDeletions, deletions);
    }

    return minDeletions;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input:

```ts
word = "aabcaba"
k = 0
```

* Frequencies: { a: 4, b: 2, c: 1 }
* Sorted freq list: \[1, 2, 4]
* Try base frequency `f = 1`: allow range \[1, 1]

  * Delete `b` (2 -> delete 2), `a` (4 -> delete 3) → total = 5
* Try `f = 2`: \[2, 2]

  * Delete `c` (1), `a` (4 -> delete 2) → total = 3
* Try `f = 4`: only `a` is in range, delete `b` and `c` → total = 3

**Result:** `3`

---

### **Summary**

This approach efficiently finds the optimal frequency window to minimize deletions, and performs well even for large strings due to the limited alphabet size.
