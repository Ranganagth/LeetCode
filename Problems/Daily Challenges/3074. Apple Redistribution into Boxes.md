[3074. Apple Redistribution into Boxes](https://leetcode.com/problems/apple-redistribution-into-boxes/)

# Intuition

Only the **total number of apples matters**.
Packs can be split across boxes, so individual pack sizes impose no constraints.
To minimize the number of boxes, always take the **largest-capacity boxes first** until the total box capacity covers all apples.

---

# Approach

1. Compute `totalApples = sum(apple)`.
2. Sort `capacity` in **descending** order.
3. Iterate through capacities, accumulating their sum.
4. Stop the moment accumulated capacity ≥ `totalApples`.
5. Count how many boxes were used.

This works because picking any smaller box instead of a larger one can only force using more boxes later.

# Complexity

* **Sorting:** `O(m log m)`
* **Scan:** `O(m)`
* **Space:** `O(1)` (ignoring sort)

---

# Code

```ts
function minimumBoxes(apple: number[], capacity: number[]): number {
    const totalApples = apple.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    capacity.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let sum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (const cap of capacity) {
        sum += cap;
        count++;
        if (sum >= totalApples) break;
    }

    return count;
};

```

# Example walkthrough

**Input:**
`apple = [1,3,2]` → total = 6
`capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]` → sort → `[5,4,3,2,1]`

Add capacities:

* use 5 → sum = 5
* use 4 → sum = 9 ≥ 6

Boxes used = **2**
