[2940. Find Building Where Alice and Bob Can Meet](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-building-where-alice-and-bob-can-meet/)


# Intuition

The problem is about finding the leftmost building where Alice and Bob can meet under specific constraints. The main challenge is efficiently handling up to *5 × 10⁴* queries on an array of up to *5 × 10⁴* heights.

Key observations:
1. Alice and Bob can only move to buildings with greater heights, and the target building must lie to their right.
2. For each query, efficiently finding the leftmost common building involves:
    - Checking reachable buildings for Alice and Bob.
    - Using precomputed information to speed up the search.

The **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)** is utilized here to store and query the smallest indices for heights greater than a certain value efficiently. This approach uses preprocessing and sorting to minimize the complexity of answering each query.

# Approach

1. **Preprocessing Queries**:
    - Swap aa and bb in queries where *a > b* to simplify processing (ensuring *a ≤ b*).
    - Sort the queries by the right endpoint (*b*) in descending order to process them sequentially.
2. **Binary Indexed Tree (BIT)**:
    - Use a BIT to maintain the leftmost indices of buildings based on heights.
    - Update the BIT as we process buildings from right to left, ensuring the tree reflects reachable buildings.
3. **Binary Search for Heights**:
    - Precompute a sorted list of unique heights for efficient mapping during BIT updates and queries.
    - Use binary search to find the position of the current height in the sorted list.
4. **Processing**:
    - Iterate over sorted queries.
    - Update the BIT for buildings processed to the right of the query range.
    - Query the BIT for the leftmost reachable building.
5. **Edge Cases**:
    - If Alice and Bob are already at the same building (*a = b*), the result is *b*.
    - If there’s no valid meeting building, return *−1*.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Preprocessing queries: ***O(q log q)***, where *q* is the number of queries.
    - BIT updates and queries: ***O(n log n + q log n)***, where *n* is the number of buildings.
    - Overall: ***O((n + q) log n)***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:    
    - Binary Indexed Tree, sorted heights array, and other intermediate data structures: ***O(n)***.

# Code

```typescript
class BinaryIndexedTree {
    private n: number;
    private c: number[];
    private inf: number = 1 << 30;

    constructor(n: number) {
        this.n = n;
        this.c = Array(n + 1).fill(this.inf);
    }

    update(x: number, v: number): void {
        while (x <= this.n) {
            this.c[x] = Math.min(this.c[x], v);
            x += x & -x;
        }
    }

    query(x: number): number {
        let mi = this.inf;
        while (x > 0) {
            mi = Math.min(mi, this.c[x]);
            x -= x & -x;
        }
        return mi === this.inf ? -1 : mi;
    }
}

function leftmostBuildingQueries(heights: number[], queries: number[][]): number[] {
    const n = heights.length;
    const m = queries.length;

    // Normalize queries to ensure l <= r
    for (const q of queries) {
        if (q[0] > q[1]) {
            [q[0], q[1]] = [q[1], q[0]];
        }
    }

    // Sort queries by right endpoint in descending order
    const idx: number[] = Array(m).fill(0).map((_, i) => i);
    idx.sort((i, j) => queries[j][1] - queries[i][1]);

    // Initialize BIT and answer array
    const tree = new BinaryIndexedTree(n);
    const ans: number[] = Array(m).fill(-1);

    // Precompute sorted heights
    const sortedHeights = [...heights].sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Binary search to find the position of a height
    const search = (x: number): number => {
        let [l, r] = [0, n];
        while (l < r) {
            const mid = (l + r) >> 1;
            if (sortedHeights[mid] >= x) {
                r = mid;
            } else {
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    };

    // Process queries
    let j = n - 1;
    for (const i of idx) {
        const [l, r] = queries[i];

        // Update BIT for buildings to the right of the current query range
        while (j > r) {
            const k = n - search(heights[j]) + 1;
            tree.update(k, j);
            --j;
        }

        if (l === r || heights[l] < heights[r]) {
            ans[i] = r;
        } else {
            const k = n - search(heights[l]);
            ans[i] = tree.query(k);
        }
    }

    return ans;
};

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1

**Input**:

```typescript
const heights = [6, 4, 8, 5, 2, 7];
const queries = [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4], [2, 2]];
console.log(leftmostBuildingQueries(heights, queries)); // Output: [2, 5, -1, 5, 2]
```

**Explanation**:

- Query 1: Alice (0) -> [2, 5], Bob (1) -> [2, 5]. Common: 2.
- Query 2: Alice (0) -> [2, 5], Bob (3) -> [5]. Common: 5.
- Query 3: Alice (2) -> [5], Bob (4) -> []. No common.
- Query 4: Alice (3) -> [5], Bob (4) -> []. Common: 5.
- Query 5: Alice (2) -> [5], Bob (2). Already in the same building: 2.

#### Example 2

**Input**:

```typescript
const heights = [5, 3, 8, 2, 6, 1, 4, 6];
const queries = [[0, 7], [3, 5], [5, 2], [3, 0], [1, 6]];
console.log(leftmostBuildingQueries(heights, queries)); // Output: [7, 6, -1, 4, 6]
```

**Explanation**:

- Query 1: Alice (0) -> [7], Bob (7). Common: 7.
- Query 2: Alice (3) -> [4, 6], Bob (5) -> [6]. Common: 6.
- Query 3: Alice (5) -> [6], Bob (2) -> [7]. No common.
- Query 4: Alice (3) -> [4, 6], Bob (0) -> [2, 4, 7]. Common: 4.
- Query 5: Alice (1) -> [2, 4, 6], Bob (6). Common: 6.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Building**:
    - Input: *heights = [5], queries = [0,0]*.
    - Output: [0].
2. **No Common Building**:
    - Input: *heights = [3,1,4], queries = [0,2]*.
    - Output: [-1].
3. **Large Input**:
    - Validate for *n = 50,000* and *q = 50,000*, ensuring efficiency.
