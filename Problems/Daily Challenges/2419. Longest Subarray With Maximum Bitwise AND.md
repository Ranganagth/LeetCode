2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND

# Intuition:
To solve the problem, we need to focus on finding the subarray with the maximum possible bitwise AND and then return the length of the longest subarray that achieves this value.

### Key Insights:
1. **Bitwise AND Properties**:
   - The bitwise AND of a subarray gets smaller or remains the same as the subarray grows. Once a 0 appears in the AND result, all subsequent ANDs including that element will remain 0.
   - The goal is to find the maximum bitwise AND value across any subarray in `nums` and then determine the longest subarray that consistently yields this maximum value.

2. **Strategy**:
   - **Step 1**: Find the maximum number in `nums` since that will likely be the candidate for the maximum bitwise AND value.
   - **Step 2**: Once the maximum value is identified, we need to find the longest contiguous subarray that consists entirely of that maximum value.

### Plan:
1. Iterate over the array `nums` and identify the maximum number.
2. Traverse the array again and find the longest subarray that only contains this maximum value. Each time we encounter a number different from the maximum, we reset the count for the subarray.

# Approach:
1. **Find the maximum value (`max_val`)** in the array.
2. **Track the longest subarray** where all the elements are equal to `max_val`.
3. Return the length of the longest such subarray.

# Complexity:

### Time Complexity:
- **Finding the maximum value**: *O(n)*, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Looping through the array**: *O(n)* to find the longest subarray with the maximum value.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is ***O(n)***.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a few extra variables (`max_val`, `maxLength`, and `currentLength`), regardless of the input size.


# Code:

```typescript
function longestSubarray(nums: number[]): number {
    const max_val = Math.max(...nums);
    let maxLength = 0, currentLength = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === max_val) {
            currentLength++;
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        } else {
            currentLength = 0;
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Finding Maximum Value**:
   - We use the `Math.max(...nums)` to find the maximum number in the array.
   
2. **Iterating through the array**:
   - We loop through each element of `nums`. If the element is equal to `max_val`, we increment `currentLength`.
   - If we encounter a number different from `max_val`, we reset `currentLength` to 0 since the current subarray has ended.
   - During each iteration, we update `maxLength` to ensure we store the longest subarray found so far.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After looping through the array, `maxLength` will hold the length of the longest subarray where all elements are equal to the maximum value of the array.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2]`
- Maximum value is `3`.
- The longest subarray consisting of `3` is `[3, 3]`, with a length of 2.
- Output: `2`.

#### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Maximum value is `4`.
- The longest subarray with `4` is `[4]`, with a length of 1.
- Output: `1`.
