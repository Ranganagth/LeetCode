[407. Trapping Rain Water II](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water-ii/)

# Intuition

This problem is a 2D extension of the well-known "Trapping Rain Water" problem. Here, instead of trapping water between walls in a 1D array, water is trapped within the boundaries of a 2D grid. The core idea is to identify the boundaries that can hold water and calculate the trapped water cell by cell.

- The amount of water a cell can trap depends on the minimum height of its surrounding boundary.
- Use a **priority queue (min-heap)** to efficiently process the lowest boundary first and expand inward.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
    - Treat the outermost cells of the height map as the initial boundary since they cannot trap water.
    - Add these cells to a min-heap along with their heights. Mark them as visited.
	
2. **Processing with Priority Queue**:
    - While the heap is not empty:
        - Pop the cell with the lowest height.
        - For each of its unvisited neighbors:
            - Calculate the water trapped as `max(0, currentHeight - neighborHeight)`.
            - Update the neighbor's height to the maximum of its original height and the current boundary height (to maintain a valid boundary).
            - Add the neighbor to the heap and mark it as visited.
			
3. **Result**:    
    - Accumulate the trapped water for each processed cell and return the total.

# Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
    - Inserting *m × n* cells into the heap takes **O(m⋅n⋅log⁡(m⋅n))**.
    - Each cell is processed exactly once, and heap operations (insert, extract-min) cost **O(log⁡(m⋅n))**.
    - Overall: ***O(m⋅n⋅log⁡(m⋅n))***.
	
2. **Space Complexity**:
    - Priority queue and visited array: ***O(m⋅n)***.

# Code

```typescript
function trapRainWater(heightMap: number[][]): number {
    const m = heightMap.length;
    const n = heightMap[0].length;
    if (m <= 2 || n <= 2) return 0; // No water can be trapped if the grid is too small.

    // Min-heap to store cells as [height, row, col].
    const heap: [number, number, number][] = [];
    const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));

    // Directions for moving in the 2D grid (right, left, down, up).
    const directions = [
        [0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0],
    ];

    // Add boundary cells to the heap.
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j of [0, n - 1]) {
            heap.push([heightMap[i][j], i, j]);
            visited[i][j] = true;
        }
    }
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (let i of [0, m - 1]) {
            if (!visited[i][j]) {
                heap.push([heightMap[i][j], i, j]);
                visited[i][j] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    // Min-heapify the heap.
    heap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    let totalWater = 0;

    // Process the heap.
    while (heap.length > 0) {
        const [currentHeight, x, y] = heap.shift()!;

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            // Skip if the neighbor is out of bounds or already visited.
            if (nx < 0 || ny < 0 || nx >= m || ny >= n || visited[nx][ny]) {
                continue;
            }

            // Calculate trapped water for the neighbor.
            const neighborHeight = heightMap[nx][ny];
            if (currentHeight > neighborHeight) {
                totalWater += currentHeight - neighborHeight;
            }

            // Update the height of the neighbor and add it to the heap.
            heap.push([Math.max(currentHeight, neighborHeight), nx, ny]);
            visited[nx][ny] = true;

            // Re-sort the heap (simulating priority queue behavior).
            heap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
        }
    }

    return totalWater;
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const heightMap = [
    [1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2],
    [3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4],
    [2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1],
];
console.log(trapRainWater(heightMap)); // Output: 4
```

**Walkthrough**:

1. Initialize the boundary in the heap:
    - Add all boundary cells to the heap and mark them as visited.
2. Process the heap:
    - The lowest boundary cell is popped.
    - Water is trapped in neighboring cells if they are lower than the current cell.
    - Update the neighbor's height to ensure the boundary remains valid.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const heightMap = [
    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
    [3, 2, 2, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 1, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 2, 2, 3],
    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3],
];
console.log(trapRainWater(heightMap)); // Output: 10
```

**Explanation**:

- Water is trapped in the inner "bowl" formed by the lower elevation cells.
- The total trapped water is *10*.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Flat Grid**:
    - Input: `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]`
    - Output: `0` (no trapped water).
2. **Small Grid**:
    - Input: `[[1]]`
    - Output: `0`.
3. **High Elevation with Small Inner Boundary**:
    - Input: Large values on the boundary with small values in the center.
