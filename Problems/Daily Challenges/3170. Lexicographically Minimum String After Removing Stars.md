[3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographically-minimum-string-after-removing-stars/)

# Intuition

Each `'*'` acts as a delete operation:
- Remove **itself**
- Remove the **smallest lexicographical character to its left that hasn't been deleted**

The challenge lies in efficiently finding and removing the **smallest available character to the left** of each `'*'`.

# Approach

1. **Data Structure:**  
   - We use an array `charIndices` of 26 subarrays, one for each lowercase letter.  
   - These subarrays store the **positions** of each character encountered in `s`.

2. **Traversing the String:**  
   - Traverse `s` from left to right:
     - If it's a normal character, store its index in `charIndices`.
     - If it's a `'*'`, search from `'a'` to `'z'` in `charIndices`, and **pop the latest (rightmost) index of the smallest character**.
     - Replace both that character and current `'*'` with `'*'` to mark for deletion.

3. **Final Result:**
   - After processing all characters, filter out the `'*'`s and join the rest into the final result.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n * 26)$ in worst case (but practically linear for most strings because it quickly finds the smallest character)
- **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$ for storing character positions

# Code

```typescript
function clearStars(s: string): string {
    const charIndices: number[][] = Array.from({ length: 26 }, () => []);
    const chars = s.split('');

    for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
        const c = chars[i];

        if (c !== '*') {
            const idx = c.charCodeAt(0) - 97;
            charIndices[idx].push(i);
        } else {
            // Remove the smallest available character
            for (let j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if (charIndices[j].length > 0) {
                    const pos = charIndices[j].pop()!;
                    chars[pos] = '*'; // Mark the deleted character
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Filter out all '*'
    return chars.filter(c => c !== '*').join('');
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### Example 1:

**Input:** `"aaba*"`  
**Steps:**
- Indexes: `0:'a', 1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'a', 4:'*'`
- On reaching `'*'`, smallest to its left = `'a'` (multiple `'a'`, we can choose index `3`)
- Remove `'*'` at `4` and `'a'` at `3`  
**Final String:** `"aab"`  
**Output:** `"aab"`

#### Example 2:

**Input:** `"abc"`  
No `'*'` characters.  
**Output:** `"abc"`

#### Example 3:

**Input:** `"b*a*"`  
**Steps:**
- Index 0: `'b'` → store index `0`
- Index 1: `'*'` → smallest left = `'b'`, remove `'b'` at `0`, mark both positions
- Index 2: `'a'` → store index `2`
- Index 3: `'*'` → smallest left = `'a'`, remove `'a'` at `2`
- Remaining characters: all `'*'`, deleted  
**Output:** `""`

### **Summary:**

- This solution efficiently handles the removal by using index tracking for each character.
- It guarantees lexicographically smallest result after all operations.
- The use of character buckets ensures a quick lookup of the smallest available character during each `'*'` deletion.
