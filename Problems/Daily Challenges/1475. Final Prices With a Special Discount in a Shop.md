[1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-prices-with-a-special-discount-in-a-shop/)

# Intuition

The problem requires finding the next smaller or equal value for each item in the array. This can be efficiently solved using a **monotonic stack**. A stack allows us to keep track of candidate indices while iterating over the prices array, ensuring ***O(n)*** time complexity instead of ***O(n²)*** for a naive solution.

- If a smaller or equal price exists at a later index, subtract that price from the current item's price.
- Otherwise, the item's price remains unchanged.

### **Approach**

1. **Initialize Stack**:
    - Use a stack to store indices of prices for which the discount hasn't been found yet.
2. **Iterate Over the Prices**:
    - For each price, check if it is less than or equal to the price at the index stored at the top of the stack.
    - If it is, calculate the discounted price, update the result, and pop the index from the stack.
3. **Add to Stack**:
    - Push the current index to the stack since its discount may not yet be determined.
4. **Result**:    
    - The stack ensures we process each price efficiently while maintaining the order of indices.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the `prices` array.
    - Each element is pushed to and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the stack used to store indices.

# Code

```typescript
function finalPrices(prices: number[]): number[] {
    const n = prices.length;
    const result = [...prices]; // Copy the prices array to modify it
    const stack: number[] = []; // Monotonic stack to track indices

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // While stack is not empty and the current price is <= the price at the stack's top index
        while (stack.length > 0 && prices[i] <= prices[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const j = stack.pop()!; // Index of the price that gets the discount
            result[j] -= prices[i]; // Apply the discount
        }
        stack.push(i); // Add the current index to the stack
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

```typescript
const prices = [8, 4, 6, 2, 3];
console.log(finalPrices(prices)); // Output: [4, 2, 4, 2, 3]
```

**Steps**:
1. Initialize `result = [8, 4, 6, 2, 3]`, `stack = []`.
2. Process each price:
    - *i = 0*: Push index `0` to `stack`.
    - *i = 1: 4 ≤ 8* → Update `result[0] = 8 - 4 = 4`. Pop `0` from `stack`, push `1`.
    - *i = 2*: Push index `2` to `stack`.
    - *i = 3: 2 ≤ 6* → Update `result[2] = 6 - 2 = 4`. Pop `2`. *2 ≤ 4* → Update `result[1] = 4 - 2 = 2`. Pop `1`. Push `3`.
    - *i = 4*: Push index `4` to `stack`.

**Final `result`:** `[4, 2, 4, 2, 3]`.


#### **Example 2**

```typescript
const prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(finalPrices(prices)); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Steps**:
1. No price has a smaller or equal price at a later index.
2. `result` remains `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

#### **Example 3**

```typescript
const prices = [10, 1, 1, 6];
console.log(finalPrices(prices)); // Output: [9, 0, 1, 6]
```

**Steps**:
1. Initialize `result = [10, 1, 1, 6]`, `stack = []`.
2. Process each price:
    - *i = 0:* Push index `0` to `stack`.
    - *i = 1: 1 ≤ 10* → Update `result[0] = 10 - 1 = 9`. Pop `0`, push `1`.
    - *i = 2*: Push index `2` to `stack`.
    - *i = 3:* Push index `3` to `stack`.

**Final `result`:** `[9, 0, 1, 6]`.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Element**:
    - Input: `prices = [5]`.
    - Output: `[5]` (no discount possible).
2. **All Elements Equal**:
    - Input: `prices = [2, 2, 2]`.
    - Output: `[0, 0, 2]` (each element discounts the previous one).
3. **Strictly Increasing Prices**:
    - Input: `prices = [1, 2, 3]`.
    - Output: `[1, 2, 3]` (no discounts).

> This approach efficiently computes the final prices while adhering to the constraints, and the monotonic stack ensures optimal performance.
