[1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence/)

# Intuition:

The problem requires checking whether a given `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in a `sentence`. A word is defined as a substring of `sentence` separated by spaces. The task is to:
1. Identify words in the `sentence`.
2. Check for the prefix condition for each word.
3. Return the 1-based index of the first matching word.

# Approach:

1. **Split the Sentence into Words**:
    - Use the `split(' ')` method to break the `sentence` into an array of words.
2. **Iterate Through Words**: 
    - Traverse the array of words.
    - For each word, check if it starts with `searchWord` using the `startsWith()` function.
3. **Return the Index**:    
    - Return the 1-based index of the first word that satisfies the prefix condition.
    - If no such word exists, return `-1`.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n ⋅ m)***
    - nn: Number of words in the sentence (at most 100).
    - mm: Length of the longest word (at most 100).
    - The `startsWith()` method for each word takes ***O(m)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***
    - Additional space is required to store the split array of words.

# Code:

```typescript
function isPrefixOfWord(sentence: string, searchWord: string): number {
    // Split the sentence into words
    const words = sentence.split(' ');

    // Iterate through words with their indices
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        // Check if the current word starts with the searchWord
        if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) {
            // Return 1-based index
            return i + 1;
        }
    }

    // Return -1 if no word matches
    return -1;
};

### Example and Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

```typescript
sentence = "i love eating burger";
searchWord = "burg";
```

**Execution**:

- Split the sentence: `["i", "love", "eating", "burger"]`.
- Check each word:
    1. "i" → does not start with "burg".
    2. "love" → does not start with "burg".
    3. "eating" → does not start with "burg".
    4. "burger" → **starts with "burg"**.
- Return index: `4`.

**Output**:

```typescript
4
```

#### Example 2:

**Input**:

```typescript
sentence = "this problem is an easy problem";
searchWord = "pro";
```

**Execution**:

- Split the sentence: `["this", "problem", "is", "an", "easy", "problem"]`.
- Check each word:
    1. "this" → does not start with "pro".
    2. "problem" → **starts with "pro"** (first occurrence).
- Return index: `2`.

**Output**:

```typescript
2
```

#### Example 3:

**Input**:

```typescript
sentence = "i am tired";
searchWord = "you";
```

**Execution**:

- Split the sentence: `["i", "am", "tired"]`.
- Check each word:
    1. "i" → does not start with "you".
    2. "am" → does not start with "you".
    3. "tired" → does not start with "you".
- No match found.

**Output**:

```typescript
-1
```

### Key Takeaways:

- The `startsWith()` method is efficient for checking prefixes.
- Returning 1-based indexing involves adding 1 to the 0-based index.
- The solution scales well given the constraints of ***O(n⋅m)***.
