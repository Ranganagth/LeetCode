[67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary/)

# Intuition

Binary addition is identical to decimal addition but base-2.
For each position from right to left:

```
sum = bitA + bitB + carry
result_bit = sum % 2
carry = floor(sum / 2)
```

Continue until both strings and carry are exhausted.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize pointers at the end of both strings.
2. Traverse from right to left.
3. At each step:

   * Read current bits (0 if pointer is out of range).
   * Add them with the carry.
   * Append `(sum % 2)` to result.
   * Update carry `(sum // 2)`.
4. Reverse the accumulated result.

This avoids converting to integers (strings can be length 10⁴).

# Complexity

* Time: `O(max(n, m))`
* Space: `O(max(n, m))`

# Code

```ts
function addBinary(a: string, b: string): string {
    let i = a.length - 1;
    let j = b.length - 1;
    let carry = 0;
    const res: string[] = [];

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
        let sum = carry;

        if (i >= 0) sum += a.charCodeAt(i--) - 48;
        if (j >= 0) sum += b.charCodeAt(j--) - 48;

        res.push((sum % 2).toString());
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 2);
    }

    return res.reverse().join('');
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Input**

```
a = "1010"
b = "1011"
```

Addition from right:

| a   | b   | carry | sum | bit | carry |
| --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 1   | 0     | 1   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     | 2   | 0   | 1     |
| 0   | 0   | 1     | 1   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0     | 2   | 0   | 1     |
|     |     | 1     | 1   | 1   | 0     |

Reverse bits:

```
10101
```

**Output:**

```
"10101"
```
