[3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-adjacent-elements-in-a-circular-array/)
# Intuition

Since it's a circular array, we must consider **every pair of consecutive elements**, including the pair formed by the **last and first** elements. For each such pair, compute the absolute difference and return the maximum among all of them.

# Approach

1. Initialize a variable `maxDiff` to store the maximum absolute difference.
2. Loop through the array from `i = 0` to `n - 1`:
   * For each index `i`, compute the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[(i + 1) % n]` (to wrap around circularly).
   * Update `maxDiff` with the maximum of the current difference and the previous maximum.
3. Return `maxDiff`.

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
* **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, constant space.

# Code

```typescript
function maxAdjacentDistance(nums: number[]): number {
    const n = nums.length;
    let maxDiff = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const nextIndex = (i + 1) % n;  // wrap around
        const diff = Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[nextIndex]);
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, diff);
    }

    return maxDiff;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs:**

#### **Example 1:**

* **Input**: `[1, 2, 4]`
* Differences:

  * |1 - 2| = 1
  * |2 - 4| = 2
  * |4 - 1| = 3 (circular)
* **Output**: `3`

#### **Example 2:**

* **Input**: `[-5, -10, -5]`
* Differences:

  * \|-5 - (-10)| = 5
  * \|-10 - (-5)| = 5
  * \|-5 - (-5)| = 0
* **Output**: `5`
