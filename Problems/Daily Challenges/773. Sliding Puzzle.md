[773. Sliding Puzzle](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-puzzle/)

# Intuition:

The given puzzle can be seen as a graph traversal problem where each board configuration is a node, and edges exist between nodes if one configuration can be reached from another by a single move. To find the least number of moves, we need to explore all possible configurations in a breadth-first manner. This is best achieved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, which guarantees that the first time we reach the solved configuration, it's done in the least number of moves.

### Key Observations:

1. The **goal state** of the puzzle is a specific arrangement: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]`.
2. Each move consists of swapping the empty space (`0`) with one of its 4 adjacent tiles (up, down, left, right).
3. BFS will allow us to explore all possible moves level-by-level, ensuring that we find the solution in the minimum number of steps.

# Approach:

1. **Represent the Board as a String**: This simplifies the problem by transforming the 2D board into a 1D string, making comparisons easier.
    
    - Convert the board to a string and treat it as a node.
    - The goal configuration can also be represented as a string.
2. **BFS Setup**:
    
    - Initialize a queue to store the board configurations.
    - Maintain a set to store visited configurations to avoid cycles.
    - Each element in the queue will hold the board configuration and the number of moves taken to reach it.
3. **Neighbor Generation**:
    
    - For each configuration, generate possible new configurations by moving the `0` to its adjacent positions (up, down, left, right).
4. **Termination**:
    
    - If we reach the goal configuration, return the number of moves.
    - If we exhaust the queue without reaching the goal, return `-1`.

# Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as the number of possible configurations is fixed. There are only 6! (720) possible configurations for a 2x3 board. BFS will visit each configuration at most once, leading to constant time complexity.
2. **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, for storing the board configurations and the BFS queue, which at most holds all possible board states.

# Code

```typescript
function slidingPuzzle(board: number[][]): number {
    const goal = "123450";  // The goal state as a string
    const start = board.flat().join("");  // Flatten the board to a string
    
    if (start === goal) return 0;  // If the board is already in the goal state, return 0
    
    const directions = [-1, 1, -3, 3];  // Possible moves (left, right, up, down)
    const queue: [string, number][] = [[start, 0]];  // Queue to store configurations and move count
    const visited = new Set<string>();  // Set to track visited configurations
    visited.add(start);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [current, moves] = queue.shift()!;
        
        // Find the index of '0' in the current board configuration
        const zeroIndex = current.indexOf('0');
        
        // Try all possible moves
        for (let direction of directions) {
            const newIndex = zeroIndex + direction;
            
            // Check if the move is valid (staying within bounds)
            if (newIndex >= 0 && newIndex < 6 && (direction !== -1 || zeroIndex % 3 !== 0) && (direction !== 1 || newIndex % 3 !== 0)) {
                const newBoard = current.split('');
                [newBoard[zeroIndex], newBoard[newIndex]] = [newBoard[newIndex], newBoard[zeroIndex]];  // Swap the '0' and the adjacent tile
                
                const newState = newBoard.join('');
                
                if (newState === goal) return moves + 1;  // If goal state is reached, return the move count
                if (!visited.has(newState)) {
                    visited.add(newState);
                    queue.push([newState, moves + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // Return -1 if no solution is found
};

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:

```javascript
board = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 0, 5]]
```

- Start state: `"123045"`.
- The goal state is `"123450"`.
- The `0` is at position `4`, and the only move possible is to swap `0` with `5` at position `5`.
- After one move, the board becomes: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0]]`, which is the goal state.

**Output**:

```javascript
1
```

#### Example 2:

**Input**:

```javascript
board = [[1, 2, 3], [5, 4, 0]]
```

- Start state: `"123540"`.
- The goal state is `"123450"`.
- However, the configuration cannot reach the goal state due to the positions of `4` and `5`. It is impossible to solve.

**Output**:

```javascript
-1
```

#### Example 3:

**Input**:

```javascript
board = [[4, 1, 2], [5, 0, 3]]
```

- Start state: `"412503"`.
- The goal state is `"123450"`.
- After 5 moves, the configuration reaches the goal state.

**Output**:

```javascript
5
```

### Key Insights:

1. **BFS is ideal for shortest path problems** like this one, where we are interested in the least number of moves.
2. Representing the board as a string simplifies comparisons and state transitions.
3. The set of all possible board configurations is relatively small, so BFS is computationally feasible even with a large number of configurations.
