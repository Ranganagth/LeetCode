[3217. Delete Nodes From Linked List Present in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-from-linked-list-present-in-array/)

# Intuition

We are given a linked list and an array `nums`. The task is to remove all nodes from the linked list that have values present in the array `nums`. Since `nums` could contain up to *10⁵* elements, we need an efficient way to check whether a value in the linked list exists in `nums`.

To achieve this, we can:
- Convert `nums` to a set for ***O(1)*** average-time complexity lookups.
- Traverse the linked list and skip the nodes whose values are found in the set.

# Approach

1. **Convert `nums` to a Set**: 
   - Using a set allows for ***O(1)*** average time complexity to check if a node's value is in `nums`.

2. **Iterate Over the Linked List**:
   - We need to traverse the linked list while checking if each node’s value exists in the set.
   - If a node's value exists in the set, it is removed from the list.
   - Otherwise, we link the current node to the next valid node.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The head node might have to be removed, so we need a dummy node to handle cases where the head is deleted.
   - We need to ensure that all nodes with values in `nums` are completely removed, including consecutive nodes.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m)***, where `n` is the number of elements in the linked list and `m` is the length of `nums`. This is because we convert `nums` into a set in ***O(m)*** and then traverse the linked list in ***O(n)***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, where `m` is the length of `nums` since we store the values in a set.

# Code

```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function modifiedList(head: ListNode | null, nums: number[]): ListNode | null {
    const toRemove = new Set(nums);
    
	let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    
    let current = dummy;
    
    while (current.next !== null) {
        if (toRemove.has(current.next.val)) {
            current.next = current.next.next;
        } else {
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
    
    return dummy.next;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **`ListNode` Class**:
   - Represents each node in the linked list, containing a `val` (value) and a `next` pointer to the next node.

2. **`removeElements` Function**:
   - **`toRemove` Set**: Stores all values from `nums`, allowing for ***O(1)*** lookup time.
   - **Dummy Node**: We create a dummy node pointing to the head of the list to simplify edge cases, like when the head node itself needs to be removed.
   - **Iterating the List**: We traverse the list, and if the next node’s value is in the set, we skip that node by adjusting the pointers.
   - **Return the Modified List**: We return `dummy.next`, which is the new head of the list.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3], head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

1. Convert `nums` to a set: `{1, 2, 3}`.
2. Traverse the list:
   - Node with value `1` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `2` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `3` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `4` is not in the set, so it remains.
   - Node with value `5` is not in the set, so it remains.
3. Return the modified list: `[4, 5]`.

#### Example 2:

Input: `nums = [1], head = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`

1. Convert `nums` to a set: `{1}`.
2. Traverse the list:
   - Node with value `1` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `2` is not in the set, so it remains.
   - Node with value `1` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `2` is not in the set, so it remains.
   - Node with value `1` is in the set, so it's removed.
   - Node with value `2` is not in the set, so it remains.
3. Return the modified list: `[2, 2, 2]`.
