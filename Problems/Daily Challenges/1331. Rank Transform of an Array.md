[1331. Rank Transform of an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/)

# Intuition:

The task asks us to replace each element in the array with its rank based on how large or small the element is compared to others. If two elements are equal, they must share the same rank, and the ranks should start from 1 and increase sequentially.

The problem boils down to sorting the array, assigning ranks based on the sorted order, and then mapping these ranks back to their original positions.

# Approach:

1. **Sort and Map:** 
   - First, we sort the unique elements in the array and assign them ranks.
   - Then, we map each element in the original array to its corresponding rank.

2. **Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Create a sorted array of unique elements from the original array. This allows us to assign ranks based on the relative order of elements.
   - **Step 2:** Create a mapping of each element to its rank (i.e., the position in the sorted array).
   - **Step 3:** Iterate through the original array and replace each element with its rank from the map.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Sorting the array will take *O(n log n)* time.
   - Creating the map and then iterating through the original array will take *O(n)* time.
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is *O(n log n)*, which is efficient enough given the constraints.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** ***O(n log n)*** due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity:** ***O(n)*** for storing the rank map and sorted unique elements.

# Code:

```typescript
function arrayRankTransform(arr: number[]): number[] {
    const sortedUnique = Array.from(new Set(arr)).sort((a, b) => a - b);

    const rankMap = new Map<number, number>();
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedUnique.length; i++) {
        rankMap.set(sortedUnique[i], i + 1);
    }

    return arr.map(num => rankMap.get(num)!);
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **Create a sorted unique list:**
   - `Array.from(new Set(arr))`: Removes duplicates from the array.
   - `.sort((a, b) => a - b)`: Sorts the array in ascending order.

2. **Create a rank map:**
   - For each element in the sorted unique array, we assign a rank starting from 1. This ensures that the smallest element gets rank 1, the second smallest gets rank 2, and so on.

3. **Replace elements with their ranks:**
   - We map over the original array and replace each element with the rank stored in `rankMap`.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

- Input: `arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]`
- Sorted Unique Array: `[10, 20, 30, 40]`
- Rank Map: `{10: 1, 20: 2, 30: 3, 40: 4}`
- Output: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`

Explanation:
- The element `40` is the largest, so its rank is `4`.
- The element `10` is the smallest, so its rank is `1`.
- Similarly, `20` gets rank `2` and `30` gets rank `3`.

#### Example 2:

- Input: `arr = [100, 100, 100]`
- Sorted Unique Array: `[100]`
- Rank Map: `{100: 1}`
- Output: `[1, 1, 1]`

Explanation:
- All elements are the same, so they all share the same rank `1`.

#### Example 3:

- Input: `arr = [37, 12, 28, 9, 100, 56, 80, 5, 12]`
- Sorted Unique Array: `[5, 9, 12, 28, 37, 56, 80, 100]`
- Rank Map: `{5: 1, 9: 2, 12: 3, 28: 4, 37: 5, 56: 6, 80: 7, 100: 8}`
- Output: `[5, 3, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 1, 3]`

Explanation:
- The element `37` is the fifth smallest, so its rank is `5`.
- The element `12` is the third smallest, so its rank is `3` (appearing twice in the array).
- The element `5` is the smallest, so its rank is `1`.

### Conclusion:
This approach efficiently assigns ranks to the elements in the array by leveraging sorting and mapping, and it ensures that equal elements share the same rank while maintaining a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
