[2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank/)

# Intuition

Each `'1'` in a row represents a **security device**.

A **laser beam** can exist **between two consecutive non-empty rows** (rows that have at least one `'1'`).

For two such consecutive rows:

* Let the number of devices in the upper row = `a`
* Let the number of devices in the lower row = `b`

Then, the number of beams between them is simply:

$\text{beams} = a \times b$

This is because each device in the upper row can connect to each device in the lower row (independent beams).

Rows with only `'0'`s break continuity — lasers **cannot pass through** them.

# Approach

1. **Iterate through each row of the bank**.
2. **Count the number of devices** (`'1'`) in each row.
3. If the count is **non-zero**:

   * Multiply it with the device count from the **previous non-empty row**.
   * Add that to the total beams count.
   * Update the previous non-empty row count to the current one.
4. Continue until all rows are processed.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(m × n)
  * We scan each character in each row once.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  * Only a few counters are used.

# Code

```typescript
function numberOfBeams(bank: string[]): number {
  let prevDevices = 0;
  let totalBeams = 0;

  for (const row of bank) {
    const currDevices = row.split('').filter(ch => ch === '1').length;
    if (currDevices > 0) {
      totalBeams += prevDevices * currDevices;
      prevDevices = currDevices;
    }
  }

  return totalBeams;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

#### Input:

```text
bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]
```

Let's process row by row.

| Row Index | Row        | Devices Count | Beams Added | Total Beams | Explanation                                      |
| --------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 0         | `"011001"` | 3             | 0           | 0           | First non-empty row (no previous row to connect) |
| 1         | `"000000"` | 0             | 0           | 0           | Empty row (ignored)                              |
| 2         | `"010100"` | 2             | 3×2 = 6     | 6           | 3 devices (row 0) × 2 devices (row 2)            |
| 3         | `"001000"` | 1             | 2×1 = 2     | 8           | 2 devices (row 2) × 1 device (row 3)             |

**Final total beams = 8**
#### Output

```text
8
```


### Example 2

#### Input:

```text
bank = ["000", "111", "000"]
```

| Row | Devices | Beams Added |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 0   | 0       | 0           |
| 1   | 3       | 0           |
| 2   | 0       | 0           |

No two non-empty rows exist consecutively, so **no beams** can form.

**Output:** `0`
