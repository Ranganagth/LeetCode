[1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-odd-numbers-in-an-interval-range/)

# Intuition

Odd numbers occur every 2 steps. Instead of looping and checking each number, compute how many odds fit in the range using arithmetic.

Core Observation
Count of odd numbers from `0` to `x` is:

```
(x + 1) // 2
```

So count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` is:

```
count(high) - count(low - 1)
```

---

# Approach

1. Compute how many odd numbers exist from `0` to `high`.
2. Compute how many odd numbers exist from `0` to `low - 1`.
3. Subtract the second result from the first.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

# Code

```ts
function countOdds(low: number, high: number): number {
    const oddsUntil = (x: number) => Math.floor((x + 1) / 2);
    return oddsUntil(high) - oddsUntil(low - 1);
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

**Input:**

```
low = 3, high = 7
```

**Step-by-step:**

```
oddsUntil(7) = (7+1)//2 = 4 → odds are [1,3,5,7]
oddsUntil(2) = (2+1)//2 = 1 → odds are [1]
Result = 4 - 1 = 3 → odds in range = [3,5,7]
```

**Output:** `3`
