[3330. Find the Original Typed String I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-typed-string-i/)

### Problem Summary

Alice types a string, but she might have accidentally **held a key for too long exactly once**. You're given the final `word` that appeared, and you need to find **how many distinct original strings she might have intended to type**, assuming at most one such repeated character stretch was accidental.

---

# Intuition

We want to identify all **unique ways to reduce repeated characters** in the string, under the assumption that **only one group of characters might have been held down accidentally**. That means we can only **shrink at most one group of repeating characters**, and we must preserve the character order.

For each group of repeated characters (`aaaa`, `cc`, etc.):
* Either it's intended — don't change it.
* Or it’s a possible stretch — we can shorten it to 1, 2, ..., up to original length - 1.

**We try reducing exactly one group in all possible valid ways** and keep all unique strings.

We always include the original string (no accidental repetition) as one valid possibility.

---

# Approach

1. **Group the characters** with counts using a two-pointer or run-length approach.
2. For each group where count > 1, try reducing it to every smaller possible count (from 1 to count - 1), and form a new string.
3. Store all such modified strings in a set (to handle duplicates).
4. Return the size of the set.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in the worst case:
  * O(n) to parse groups
  * For each group (max O(n)), we may generate up to O(n) shorter versions.
  
* **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for storing all unique variants in a set.

# Code

```ts
function possibleStringCount(word: string): number {
    const variants = new Set<string>();
    variants.add(word);

    // Step 1: Find all character groups
    const groups: { char: string, count: number }[] = [];
    let i = 0;
    while (i < word.length) {
        let j = i;
        while (j < word.length && word[j] === word[i]) j++;
        groups.push({ char: word[i], count: j - i });
        i = j;
    }

    // Step 2: For each group with count > 1, try reducing it
    for (let g = 0; g < groups.length; g++) {
        const { char, count } = groups[g];
        if (count > 1) {
            for (let newCount = 1; newCount < count; newCount++) {
                // Build a new word with one group reduced
                const newWordParts: string[] = [];
                for (let x = 0; x < groups.length; x++) {
                    if (x === g) {
                        newWordParts.push(char.repeat(newCount));
                    } else {
                        newWordParts.push(groups[x].char.repeat(groups[x].count));
                    }
                }
                variants.add(newWordParts.join(''));
            }
        }
    }

    return variants.size;
};

```

### **Examples and Walkthrough**

#### Example 1: `word = "abbcccc"`

Groups: `a(1), b(2), c(4)`

Reducing:
* `b(2)` to `b(1)` gives `"abcccc"`
* `c(4)` to:

  * `c(3)` → `"abbccc"`
  * `c(2)` → `"abbcc"`
  * `c(1)` → `"abbc"`

Total unique possibilities:

* `"abbcccc"`
* `"abcccc"`
* `"abbccc"`
* `"abbcc"`
* `"abbc"`

**Output: 5**

### **Summary**

By reducing exactly one group of repeated characters at a time (or none), and ensuring uniqueness with a set, we efficiently explore all possible original strings Alice might have intended. This handles the constraint that she was only clumsy at most once.
