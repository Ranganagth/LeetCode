[2976. Minimum Cost to Convert String I](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-convert-string-i/)
# Intuition

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each character (from 'a' to 'z') can be considered as a node.
   - The given transformations can be represented as directed edges with weights (costs) between these nodes.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - To find the minimum cost to transform a character `x` to a character `y`, we need to find the shortest path from node `x` to node `y` in the graph.
   - We can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, which is feasible since the number of nodes (characters) is fixed at 26.

3. **Transformation Cost Calculation**:
   - For each character in the `source` string, find the shortest path cost to transform it to the corresponding character in the `target` string.
   - Sum these costs to get the total transformation cost.
   - If any character transformation is not possible (i.e., the cost remains infinite), return -1.

# Approach

1. **Initialize Distance Matrix**:
   - Create a distance matrix `dist` where `dist[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to transform character `i` to character `j`.
   - Initialize with infinite costs except for the self-loops (`dist[i][i] = 0`).

2. **Populate Distance Matrix**:
   - Update the distance matrix with the direct transformation costs provided.

3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the matrix to find the shortest path costs between all pairs of nodes.

4. **Calculate Transformation Costs**:
   - For each character in the `source` string, use the distance matrix to find the transformation cost to the corresponding character in the `target` string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(26³ + n)***, where 26 is the number of characters and `n` is the length of the strings.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(26²)*** for the distance matrix.

# Code

```typescript
function minCostToConvert(source: string, target: string, original: string[], changed: string[], cost: number[]): number {
    const n = source.length;
    const INF = Infinity;
    const ALPHABET_SIZE = 26;
    const charToIndex = (char: string) => char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    const dist: number[][] = Array.from({ length: ALPHABET_SIZE }, () => Array(ALPHABET_SIZE).fill(INF));
    for (let i = 0; i < ALPHABET_SIZE; i++) {
        dist[i][i] = 0;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < original.length; i++) {
        const from = charToIndex(original[i]);
        const to = charToIndex(changed[i]);
        dist[from][to] = Math.min(dist[from][to], cost[i]);
    }

    for (let k = 0; k < ALPHABET_SIZE; k++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < ALPHABET_SIZE; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < ALPHABET_SIZE; j++) {
                if (dist[i][k] < INF && dist[k][j] < INF) {
                    dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    let totalCost = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const from = charToIndex(source[i]);
        const to = charToIndex(target[i]);
        if (dist[from][to] === INF) {
            return -1;
        }
        totalCost += dist[from][to];
    }

    return totalCost;
};

```

### Example 1
```typescript
console.log(minCostToConvert(
    "abcd", 
    "acbe", 
    ["a", "b", "c", "c", "e", "d"], 
    ["b", "c", "b", "e", "b", "e"], 
    [2, 5, 5, 1, 2, 20]
)); // Output: 28
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Source string: `abcd`
   - Target string: `acbe`
   - Transformations:
     - `a` -> `b` with cost 2
     - `b` -> `c` with cost 5
     - `c` -> `b` with cost 5
     - `c` -> `e` with cost 1
     - `e` -> `b` with cost 2
     - `d` -> `e` with cost 20

2. **Distance Matrix Initialization**:
   - Create a distance matrix for all 26 lowercase English letters.
   - Set the cost to transform each character to itself as 0.
   - Update the matrix with the given transformation costs.

3. **Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - This algorithm finds the shortest path between all pairs of characters, considering all possible intermediate transformations.

4. **Calculate Transformation Costs**:
   - Transform 'a' to 'a': No cost, total cost remains 0.
   - Transform 'b' to 'c': Direct transformation with cost 5, total cost becomes 5.
   - Transform 'c' to 'b', then 'b' to 'e': First 'c' to 'e' costs 1, then 'e' to 'b' costs 2. Total cost becomes 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.
   - Transform 'd' to 'e': Direct transformation with cost 20. Total cost becomes 8 + 20 = 28.

Thus, the total cost to convert "abcd" to "acbe" is 28.

### Example 2
```typescript
console.log(minCostToConvert(
    "aaaa", 
    "bbbb", 
    ["a", "c"], 
    ["c", "b"], 
    [1, 2]
)); // Output: 12
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Source string: `aaaa`
   - Target string: `bbbb`
   - Transformations:
     - `a` -> `c` with cost 1
     - `c` -> `b` with cost 2

2. **Distance Matrix Initialization**:
   - Similar to the previous example, initialize and update the distance matrix with the given transformations.

3. **Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the matrix with the shortest path costs.

4. **Calculate Transformation Costs**:
   - Transform each 'a' to 'b':
     - 'a' -> 'c' costs 1, then 'c' -> 'b' costs 2. Total cost for each 'a' is 3.
     - Since there are 4 'a's, total cost is 4 * 3 = 12.

Thus, the total cost to convert "aaaa" to "bbbb" is 12.

### Example 3
```typescript
console.log(minCostToConvert(
    "abcd", 
    "abce", 
    ["a"], 
    ["e"], 
    [10000]
)); // Output: -1
```

**Explanation**:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Source string: `abcd`
   - Target string: `abce`
   - Transformations:
     - `a` -> `e` with cost 10000

2. **Distance Matrix Initialization**:
   - Initialize and update the distance matrix.

3. **Apply Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**:
   - Update the matrix with the shortest path costs.

4. **Calculate Transformation Costs**:
   - Transform 'a' to 'a': No cost.
   - Transform 'b' to 'b': No cost.
   - Transform 'c' to 'c': No cost.
   - Transform 'd' to 'e': No direct or indirect transformation available in the given transformations.

Since it's impossible to convert 'd' to 'e' with the given transformations, the output is -1.
