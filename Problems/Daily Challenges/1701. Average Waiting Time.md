[1701. Average Waiting Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-waiting-time/)

# Intuition
The problem is about simulating the process of a single chef preparing food orders in the order customers arrive. Each customer has an arrival time and the time required to prepare their order. We need to calculate the total waiting time for all customers and then compute the average waiting time.

# Approach
1. **Initialization**: Keep track of the total waiting time and the current time (the time at which the chef is available to start a new order).
2. **Processing each customer**:
   - If the chef is idle and the current time is less than the customer's arrival time, the chef will wait until the customer arrives.
   - The chef then starts preparing the customer's order immediately.
   - Calculate the waiting time for each customer as the difference between the time the chef finishes the order and the customer's arrival time.
   - Add this waiting time to the total waiting time.
3. **Calculating the average**: After processing all customers, compute the average waiting time by dividing the total waiting time by the number of customers.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm processes each customer exactly once, so the time complexity is ***O(n)***, where n is the number of customers.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(1)*** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code

```typescript
function averageWaitingTime(customers: number[][]): number {
    let totalWaitingTime = 0;
    let currentTime = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
        let arrival = customers[i][0];
        let timeNeeded = customers[i][1];

        if (currentTime < arrival) {
            currentTime = arrival;
        }
        currentTime += timeNeeded;
        totalWaitingTime += (currentTime - arrival);
    }

    return totalWaitingTime / customers.length;
};

```


### Explanation with Example

```
const customers1 = [[1, 2], [2, 5], [4, 3]];
console.log(averageWaitingTime(customers1)); // Output: 5.00000

const customers2 = [[5, 2], [5, 4], [10, 3], [20, 1]];
console.log(averageWaitingTime(customers2)); // Output: 3.25000
```

#### Example 1:
- Input: `customers = [[1, 2], [2, 5], [4, 3]]`
- Steps:
  1. Customer 1 arrives at time 1, needs 2 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 1, finishes at time 3.
     - Waiting time: 3 - 1 = 2.
  2. Customer 2 arrives at time 2, needs 5 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 3, finishes at time 8.
     - Waiting time: 8 - 2 = 6.
  3. Customer 3 arrives at time 4, needs 3 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 8, finishes at time 11.
     - Waiting time: 11 - 4 = 7.
- Total waiting time: 2 + 6 + 7 = 15.
- Average waiting time: 15 / 3 = 5.0.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `customers = [[5, 2], [5, 4], [10, 3], [20, 1]]`
- Steps:
  1. Customer 1 arrives at time 5, needs 2 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 5, finishes at time 7.
     - Waiting time: 7 - 5 = 2.
  2. Customer 2 arrives at time 5, needs 4 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 7, finishes at time 11.
     - Waiting time: 11 - 5 = 6.
  3. Customer 3 arrives at time 10, needs 3 units of time.
     - Chef starts at time 11, finishes at time 14.
     - Waiting time: 14 - 10 = 4.
  4. Customer 4 arrives at time 20, needs 1 unit of time.
     - Chef starts at time 20, finishes at time 21.
     - Waiting time: 21 - 20 = 1.
- Total waiting time: 2 + 6 + 4 + 1 = 13.
- Average waiting time: 13 / 4 = 3.25.
