[3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-k-th-character-in-string-game-i/)

### Problem Summary

You're given:

* Initial string: `word = "a"`
* Operation: Create a new string by **incrementing each character** in `word` to its next alphabet (with wraparound at 'z'), and **append it** to the original string.
* Repeatedly apply the operation until `word.length >= k`, and return `word[k - 1]`.

---

# Intuition

This is a **string growth simulation** problem. At each step:

* We generate a new string by incrementing each character in the current word.
* Append that new string to the end.

Example progression:

```
word = "a"                      → step 0  
next = "b"       → word = "ab"  → step 1  
next = "bc"      → word = "abbc" → step 2  
next = "ccd"     → word = "abbcbccd" → step 3  
...
```

So at every step:
* `next = increment(word)`
* `word += next`

We continue until `word.length >= k`, then return `word[k - 1]`.

Since `k ≤ 500`, the total number of operations will be small.

# Approach

1. Initialize `word = "a"`
2. While `word.length < k`:
   * Generate `next` by shifting each char in `word`
   * Append `next` to `word`
3. Return `word[k - 1]`

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity**: `O(k²)` in the worst case (since each iteration nearly doubles the string length and takes O(n) to compute next string).
* **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`

Efficient enough for `k <= 500`.

# Code

```ts
function kthCharacter(k: number): string {
    let word = "a";

    while (word.length < k) {
        let next = "";
        for (const ch of word) {
            // Increment character with wraparound
            next += String.fromCharCode((ch.charCodeAt(0) - 97 + 1) % 26 + 97);
        }
        word += next;
    }

    return word[k - 1];
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

```ts
k = 5
```

Progression:

* Step 0: "a"
* Step 1: "ab"            // add "b"
* Step 2: "abbc"          // add "bc"
* Step 3: "abbcbccd"      // add "ccd"

`word[4]` = `'b'` → ✅ Output: `"b"`

#### Example 2:

```ts
k = 10
```

* "a" → "ab" → "abbc" → "abbcbccd" → "abbcbccdddee"

word\[9] = `'c'` → ✅ Output: `"c"`

---

### **Summary**

* Use simple simulation and string building
* Handle wraparound `'z' → 'a'`
* Efficient for small `k` (up to 500)
