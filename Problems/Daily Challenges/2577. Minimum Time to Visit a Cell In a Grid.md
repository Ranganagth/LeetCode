[2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-visit-a-cell-in-a-grid/)
# Intuition:

The problem is essentially about finding the shortest path on a grid with specific conditions on movement time. The grid has cells with different times, and you need to account for the time taken to move between cells, which is not constant. This suggests that the solution requires a shortest path algorithm. Given the nature of the problem, where the grid cells represent "weights" (times), the best approach is to use **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, which efficiently finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

# Approach:

1. **Initial Check**: If the starting point (grid[0][1]) and the adjacent point (grid[1][0]) have times greater than 1, it's impossible to start moving, so return `-1`.
2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:
    - Use a priority queue (or simulate one with a sorted list) to explore the grid.
    - Start from the top-left corner (`grid[0][0]`), and propagate the minimum time it takes to reach each cell by checking all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
    - For each cell, the time to move to a neighboring cell is either just 1 (if the current time is less than the time at the neighboring cell) or adjusted based on the time of the neighboring cell.
    - Continue this until reaching the bottom-right corner (`grid[m-1][n-1]`), at which point the minimum time to reach that cell is the answer.
3. **Priority Queue Management**: The queue ensures that we always process the cell with the minimum time next.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * log(m * n))`
    - Where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
    - The reason for the log factor is the use of a priority queue to select the minimum time cell to process next.
    - Each cell can be inserted into the queue at most once, and each operation (insertion, extraction) on the priority queue takes `O(log(m * n))` time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`
    - Space is used for the `dist` array (to store the minimum time for each cell) and the priority queue.

# Code:

```typescript
class Solution {
    minimumTime(grid: number[][]): number {
        if (grid[0][1] > 1 && grid[1][0] > 1) {
            return -1;
        }

        const m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        const dist: number[][] = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
        dist[0][0] = 0;

        type Tii = [number, number, number]; // Tuple for (time, row, col)
        const pq: Tii[] = [];
        pq.push([0, 0, 0]);

        const dirs = [-1, 0, 1, 0, -1]; // Directions (up, right, down, left)

        while (pq.length > 0) {
            const [t, i, j] = pq.shift()!;  // Get the cell with the minimum time

            if (i === m - 1 && j === n - 1) {
                return t;  // Return time when we reach bottom-right corner
            }

            for (let k = 0; k < 4; ++k) {
                const x = i + dirs[k], y = j + dirs[k + 1];
                if (x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n) {
                    let nt = t + 1;  // Default next time is current time + 1
                    if (nt < grid[x][y]) {
                        nt = grid[x][y] + (grid[x][y] - nt) % 2;  // Adjust time if necessary
                    }
                    if (nt < dist[x][y]) {
                        dist[x][y] = nt;  // Update minimum time for cell (x, y)
                        pq.push([nt, x, y]);  // Add new state to the priority queue
                    }
                }
            }

            // Sort the priority queue to simulate the priority queue behavior
            pq.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
        }

        return -1;  // Return -1 if no valid path to the bottom-right corner exists
    }
}
```

### Example:

#### Input:

```typescript
const grid = [
    [0, 2, 4],
    [1, 0, 3],
    [4, 1, 0]
];

const solution = new Solution();
console.log(solution.minimumTime(grid));  // Output: 4
```

### Explanation Walkthrough:

1. **Initialization**:
    
    - We start at `grid[0][0]` with a time of `0`.
    - The `dist` array is initialized with `Infinity`, except for `dist[0][0]`, which is set to `0` because it's the starting point.
2. **Priority Queue**:
    
    - The priority queue initially contains the tuple `[0, 0, 0]`, meaning `time = 0`, row = 0, column = 0.
3. **First Iteration**:
    
    - The top element `(t=0, i=0, j=0)` is processed.
    - We examine its neighboring cells (right, down).
        - Right: `(0, 1)` — The time to move there is 2, so we update the `dist` array and add it to the queue.
        - Down: `(1, 0)` — The time to move there is 1, so we update the `dist` array and add it to the queue.
4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
    
    - Continue processing cells by always picking the one with the minimum time.
    - The queue is sorted after each step to maintain the priority queue property.
5. **Final Step**:
    
    - Eventually, the bottom-right corner `(2, 2)` will be reached with a time of `4`, which is the minimum time to reach the destination.

Thus, the function returns `4`, which is the minimal time to reach the destination `(m-1, n-1)`.
