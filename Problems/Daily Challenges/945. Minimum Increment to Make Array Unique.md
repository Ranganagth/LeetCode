[945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-increment-to-make-array-unique/)

# Intuition

The basic idea is to sort the array first and then iterate through the sorted array, ensuring that each element is at least 1 greater than the previous one. This way, we can calculate the minimum number of moves needed to make each element unique.

# Approach

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array in ascending order. This helps in managing the uniqueness by simply comparing each element with its previous element.
2. **Iterate and Adjust**: Iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element. If the current element is less than or equal to the previous element, it means we need to increment it to make it unique. The number of moves needed is the difference between the current element and the previous element plus one.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** due to the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** if we sort the array in place, otherwise *O(n)* if the sorting algorithm uses extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function minIncrementForUnique(nums: number[]): number {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let moves = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
            let increment = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
            moves += increment;
            nums[i] += increment;
        }
    }

    return moves;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array**: We start by sorting the array. This allows us to easily manage and adjust duplicates.
2. **Iterating and Adjusting**: We then iterate through the sorted array. For each element, we check if it's less than or equal to the previous element. If it is, we calculate how much we need to increment it to make it unique (which is `previous element + 1`). We then update the current element and add the number of moves to our total count.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total number of moves needed to make all elements in the array unique.
