[2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements/)

# Intuition:

To maximize the score, the algorithm must:

1. Select the smallest unmarked element at each step (minimizing the score addition for each operation).
2. Mark the chosen element and its two adjacent elements (if they exist), ensuring no overlapping markings for future steps.
3. Repeat until all elements are marked.
The **greedy approach** works well because selecting the smallest element at every step guarantees the lowest score increase.

# Approach:

1. **Tracking Marked Elements:**
    - Use a boolean array `marked` to track whether each element and its adjacent elements have been marked.
2. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap):**
    - Use a min-heap to efficiently retrieve the smallest unmarked element. The min-heap stores tuples of the form `(value, index)` where `value` is the element's value and `index` is its position.
3. **Processing Elements:**
    - While the heap is not empty:
        - Extract the smallest unmarked element.
        - If the element is already marked, skip it.
        - Mark the chosen element and its adjacent elements.
        - Add its value to the `score`.
4. **Edge Cases:**
    - Arrays with all equal values.
    - Arrays with a single element.

# Complexity:

1. **Time Complexity:**
    - Constructing the heap: **O(n log⁡ n)**, where *n* is the size of `nums`.
    - Iterating through the heap: ***O(n log n)*** since each insertion and extraction is **O(log n)**.
    - Total: ***O(n log n)***.
2. **Space Complexity:**
    - ***O(n)*** for the `marked` array and heap.

# Code:

```typescript
function findScore(nums: number[]): number {
    // Min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements and their indices
    const heap: [number, number][] = nums.map((value, index) => [value, index]);
    heap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // Sort by value for heap simulation

    // Array to keep track of marked elements
    const marked: boolean[] = new Array(nums.length).fill(false);

    let score = 0;

    // Process the heap
    for (const [value, index] of heap) {
        // If the element is already marked, skip it
        if (marked[index]) continue;

        // Add the current element's value to the score
        score += value;

        // Mark the current element and its neighbors
        marked[index] = true;
        if (index > 0) marked[index - 1] = true; // Mark left neighbor
        if (index < nums.length - 1) marked[index + 1] = true; // Mark right neighbor
    }

    return score;
};

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1:**

**Input:**

```typescript
nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2];
```

**Execution:**
1. Construct the heap: `[(1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4)]`.
2. Process elements:
    - Choose `1` at index `1`. Mark indices `[0, 1, 2]`. Score: `1`.
    - Choose `2` at index `5`. Mark indices `[4, 5]`. Score: `1 + 2 = 3`.
    - Choose `4` at index `3`. Mark index `[3]`. Score: `3 + 4 = 7`.
3. Final score: `7`.

**Output:**

```typescript
7
```

#### **Example 2:**

**Input:**

```typescript
nums = [2,3,5,1,3,2];
```

**Execution:**
1. Construct the heap: `[(1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (5, 2)]`.
2. Process elements:
    - Choose `1` at index `3`. Mark indices `[2, 3, 4]`. Score: `1`.
    - Choose `2` at index `0`. Mark indices `[0, 1]`. Score: `1 + 2 = 3`.
    - Choose `2` at index `5`. Mark index `[5]`. Score: `3 + 2 = 5`.
3. Final score: `5`.

**Output:**

```typescript
5
```

### **Key Insights:**

1. Using a min-heap ensures efficient selection of the smallest unmarked element.
2. Marking adjacent elements avoids overlapping and redundant additions.
3. The greedy algorithm ensures an optimal solution by always prioritizing the smallest available value.
