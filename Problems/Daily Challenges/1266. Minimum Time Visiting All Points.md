[1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-visiting-all-points/)

## Problem Core

Movement allows one unit horizontally, one unit vertically, or one unit diagonally (one horizontal + one vertical) per second. Diagonal movement dominates when both x and y distances remain. The task reduces to computing the minimal time to move between consecutive points, then summing.

---

# Intuition

Between two points $((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2))$:

* Horizontal distance = $(|x_2 - x_1|)$
* Vertical distance = $(|y_2 - y_1|)$

Each diagonal move reduces both distances by 1 in one second.
Once one axis is exhausted, remaining distance must be covered by straight moves.

Therefore:

* Use diagonal moves for `min(dx, dy)`
* Use straight moves for the remaining `max(dx, dy) - min(dx, dy)`

Total time between two points is:
$$\max(dx, dy)$$

This is optimal and unavoidable under the movement rules.

# Approach

1. Initialize `totalTime = 0`.
2. For each consecutive pair of points:

   * Compute `dx = abs(x₂ - x₁)`
   * Compute `dy = abs(y₂ - y₁)`
   * Add `max(dx, dy)` to `totalTime`
3. Return `totalTime`

---

# Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)

---

# Code

```typescript
function minTimeToVisitAllPoints(points: number[][]): number {
    let totalTime = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        const dx = Math.abs(points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]);
        const dy = Math.abs(points[i][1] - points[i - 1][1]);
        totalTime += Math.max(dx, dy);
    }

    return totalTime;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

`points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]`

* From `[1,1]` → `[3,4]`

  * dx = 2, dy = 3
  * Time = max(2, 3) = 3
* From `[3,4]` → `[-1,0]`

  * dx = 4, dy = 4
  * Time = max(4, 4) = 4

Total time = `3 + 4 = 7`

### Example 2

`points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]`

* dx = 5, dy = 0
* Time = max(5, 0) = 5

Output = `5`

**Key Insight**

This problem is not geometric. It is discrete.
Diagonal movement collapses the problem into Chebyshev distance.
