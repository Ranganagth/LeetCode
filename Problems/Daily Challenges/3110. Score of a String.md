[3110. Score of a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/score-of-a-string/)

# Intuition

1. **Convert Characters to ASCII Values**: Each character in the string can be converted to its ASCII value using the `ord()` function in Python.
2. **Calculate Differences**: For each pair of adjacent characters, compute the absolute difference between their ASCII values.
3. **Sum the Differences**: Sum all the absolute differences to get the final score.

# Approach

1. **Initialize a Variable**: Start with a variable `score` initialized to zero to accumulate the sum of differences.
2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through the string, considering each pair of adjacent characters.
3. **Compute and Accumulate Differences**: For each pair, compute the absolute difference of their ASCII values and add it to `score`.
4. **Return the Result**: After iterating through the string, return the accumulated `score`.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the string. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a few extra variables for computation.

# Code
```typescript
function scoreOfString(s: string): number {
    let score = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
        score += Math.abs(s.charCodeAt(i) - s.charCodeAt(i + 1));
    }
    
    return score;
};

```

### Explanation of the Example

- For the string "hello":
  - ASCII values: h = 104, e = 101, l = 108, l = 108, o = 111
  - Differences: |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111|
  - Calculation: 3 + 7 + 0 + 3 = 13

- For the string "zaz":
  - ASCII values: z = 122, a = 97, z = 122
  - Differences: |122 - 97| + |97 - 122|
  - Calculation: 25 + 25 = 50
