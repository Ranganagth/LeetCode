884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

### Problem Overview:

You are given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, and you need to return a list of "uncommon" words. An uncommon word is defined as a word that appears exactly once in one of the sentences and does not appear in the other sentence.

# Intuition:

1. **Word Frequency**: The key insight is that an uncommon word appears exactly once across both sentences. So, we need to count the frequency of each word across both `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Filter for Uncommon Words**: After counting the frequency, any word that appears exactly once in the combined list of words from `s1` and `s2` is considered uncommon.

# Approach:

1. **Concatenate Both Sentences**: Combine the words of both sentences into a single list of words.

2. **Use a Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each word in both sentences.

3. **Filter Words**: After counting the words, collect those that appear exactly once.

# Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of words in `s1` and `m` is the number of words in `s2`.
  - We first split both sentences into words: O(n + m).
  - We build the frequency map by iterating through all words: O(n + m).
  - Finally, we iterate through the map to collect the uncommon words: ***O(n + m)***.

### Space Complexity:
- ***O(n + m)*** for storing the words and their frequencies in the frequency map.

# Code:

```typescript
function uncommonFromSentences(s1: string, s2: string): string[] {
    const wordCount: { [key: string]: number } = {};

    const countWords = (sentence: string) => {
        const words = sentence.split(' ');
        for (let word of words) {
            wordCount[word] = (wordCount[word] || 0) + 1;
        }
    };

    countWords(s1);
    countWords(s2);

    const result: string[] = [];
    for (let word in wordCount) {
        if (wordCount[word] === 1) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### Explanation:

1. **countWords Function**: This helper function splits a sentence into individual words and updates the `wordCount` map by incrementing the count of each word.

2. **Count Words in s1 and s2**: Both sentences `s1` and `s2` are passed through `countWords`, which records the frequency of each word in both sentences combined.

3. **Filter for Uncommon Words**: After counting, we iterate through the `wordCount` map and add words that have a count of exactly 1 to the result list.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the list of words that appear exactly once across both sentences.

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:

Input: 
```plaintext
s1 = "this apple is sweet"
s2 = "this apple is sour"
```

1. **Count Words**:
   - For `s1`: 
     - `"this" -> 1`, `"apple" -> 1`, `"is" -> 1`, `"sweet" -> 1`
   - For `s2`: 
     - `"this" -> 2`, `"apple" -> 2`, `"is" -> 2`, `"sour" -> 1`

2. **Word Frequency**:
   - `{"this": 2, "apple": 2, "is": 2, "sweet": 1, "sour": 1}`

3. **Uncommon Words**:
   - Words that appear exactly once: `["sweet", "sour"]`

Output:
```plaintext
["sweet", "sour"]
```

#### Example 2:

Input: 
```plaintext
s1 = "apple apple"
s2 = "banana"
```

1. **Count Words**:
   - For `s1`: 
     - `"apple" -> 2`
   - For `s2`: 
     - `"banana" -> 1`

2. **Word Frequency**:
   - `{"apple": 2, "banana": 1}`

3. **Uncommon Words**:
   - Words that appear exactly once: `["banana"]`

Output:
```plaintext
["banana"]
```

### Conclusion:

By counting the frequency of words across both sentences and filtering out words that appear exactly once, we can efficiently find the uncommon words in `O(n + m)` time. This approach ensures scalability even for larger sentences and guarantees correctness by tracking the occurrence of every word across both sentences.
