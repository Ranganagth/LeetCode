[1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-lucky-integer-in-an-array/)

### Problem Summary

You are given an integer array `arr`. A **lucky integer** is one that appears in the array **exactly as many times as its value**.

**Task**: Return the **largest lucky integer**. If none exist, return `-1`.

---

# Intuition

* Count how many times each number appears.
* For every number `x`, if its **frequency is equal to `x`**, then it's a lucky number.
* Among all lucky numbers, return the **maximum**.

---

# Approach

1. Use a frequency map to count occurrences of each number.
2. Iterate through the keys of the frequency map.
   * For each key `num`, check if `freq[num] === num`.
3. Track the **maximum** such lucky number.
4. Return `-1` if no such number is found.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** O(n), where n = `arr.length`
* **Space:** O(n) for the frequency map (at most 500 entries)

---

# Code

```ts
function findLucky(arr: number[]): number {
    const freq: Record<number, number> = {};

    for (const num of arr) {
        freq[num] = (freq[num] || 0) + 1;
    }

    let maxLucky = -1;

    for (const num in freq) {
        const n = parseInt(num);
        if (freq[n] === n) {
            maxLucky = Math.max(maxLucky, n);
        }
    }

    return maxLucky;
};

```

### **Example Walkthroughs**

#### Example 1:

```ts
Input: [2, 2, 3, 4]
```

* Frequencies: {2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}
* Only 2 has frequency equal to its value → **Lucky**
* Output: `2`

#### Example 2:

```ts
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```

* Frequencies: {1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
* All values are lucky → max is **3**
* Output: `3`

#### Example 3:

```ts
Input: [2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```

* Frequencies: {2: 3, 3: 2}
* No number has frequency equal to its value
* Output: `-1`

---

### **Summary**

* Use a frequency map to count occurrences.
* Return the **maximum number** whose frequency equals its value.
* Efficient and simple to implement for the given constraints.
