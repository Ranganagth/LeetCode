[3440. Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-ii/)
### Problem Summary

You're given:

* An event of total duration `eventTime`.
* `n` **non-overlapping** meetings represented by `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]`, sorted and disjoint.
* You can **reschedule at most one meeting**, i.e., move it **anywhere within the event duration**, while maintaining:

  * Same **duration**,
  * **Non-overlapping** condition with the rest.

**Goal:** Maximize the longest continuous free time after rescheduling **one** meeting (or none).

---

# Intuition

If you can move one meeting anywhere:

* Try to **move it into any available gap** (before/after/within the timeline) so that it **opens up** the **largest free segment** somewhere else.
* You need to find:

  1. Which meetings can **fit into some other gap**, leaving their original position fully free.
  2. Which **gaps** are large enough to **receive** those meetings.
* Try both from **left-to-right** and **right-to-left** to identify viable meetings and gaps.

---

# Approach

1. **Precompute:**
   * From left: for each meeting, check if its duration can fit into a previous **gap** (before it).
   * From right: for each meeting, check if it can be shifted to a **later** gap.

2. **Mark `q[i] = true`** if meeting `i` can be moved.

3. For each index `i`:
   * `left = endTime[i-1]` or 0
   * `right = startTime[i+1]` or `eventTime`
   * If `q[i]` (can be moved): the full gap `[left, right]` becomes free
   * Else: if meeting stays, the **remaining gap** is `right - left - duration[i]`

4. Return the **maximum** possible free time among all such evaluations.

# Complexity Analysis

* **O(n)** time:
  * One pass left-to-right
  * One pass right-to-left
  * One final scan to check max gap
  
* **O(n)** space for auxiliary array `q`

# Code

```ts
function maxFreeTime(
    eventTime: number,
    startTime: number[],
    endTime: number[],
): number {
    const n = startTime.length;
    const q: boolean[] = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let t1 = 0, t2 = 0;

    // From left to right: check if meeting i can fit before it
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const duration = endTime[i] - startTime[i];
        if (duration <= t1) q[i] = true;
        t1 = Math.max(t1, startTime[i] - (i === 0 ? 0 : endTime[i - 1]));
    }

    // From right to left: check if meeting i can fit after it
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const duration = endTime[i] - startTime[i];
        if (duration <= t2) q[i] = true;
        t2 = Math.max(
            t2,
            (i === n - 1 ? eventTime : startTime[i + 1]) - endTime[i]
        );
    }

    let maxFree = 0;

    // Evaluate maximum free segment
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const left = i === 0 ? 0 : endTime[i - 1];
        const right = i === n - 1 ? eventTime : startTime[i + 1];

        if (q[i]) {
            maxFree = Math.max(maxFree, right - left); // fully remove meeting
        } else {
            const duration = endTime[i] - startTime[i];
            maxFree = Math.max(maxFree, right - left - duration); // gap minus occupied
        }
    }

    return maxFree;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 2:

```ts
eventTime = 10
startTime = [0,7,9]
endTime =   [1,8,10]
```

* Durations: \[1,1,1]
* Gaps:

  * \[1,7] = 6
  * \[8,9] = 1

Meeting at \[0,1] can be moved into \[8,9] → opens up \[0,7] = 7 units free

Output: **7**

---

### **Summary**

* Efficient greedy method using prefix/postfix max-gap checks.
* Smartly determines which meeting can be rescheduled **into another valid slot**.
* Guarantees **O(n)** performance even for `n = 1e5`.
* Flexible: doesn’t require maintaining meeting order after rescheduling.
