[2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-number-of-beautiful-subsets/)

# Intuition
To determine the number of non-empty beautiful subsets, we need to consider subsets that do not contain any pair of integers with an absolute difference of `k`. Given the constraints, we can use a backtracking approach to generate all possible subsets and count those that meet the criteria.

# Approach
1. Use backtracking to generate all subsets of the array `nums`.
2. For each subset generated, check if it is beautiful:
   - A subset is beautiful if for any two elements `a` and `b` in the subset, `|a - b|` is not equal to `k`.
3. Count all subsets that meet the criteria.
4. Return the count of beautiful subsets.

# Explanation
1. **Backtracking Setup**:
   - Initialize a variable to count the beautiful subsets.
   - Define a helper function `backtrack` that takes the current subset and the starting index.
2. **Generating Subsets**:
   - At each call of the helper function, decide whether to include the current element or not.
   - Check if including the current element maintains the subset as beautiful.
   - Recursively call the helper function for the next elements.
3. **Checking Subsets**:
   - A subset is checked for the condition `|a - b| != k` for all pairs `a` and `b` in the subset.
4. **Counting Beautiful Subsets**:
   - If a subset is beautiful, increment the count.
   - Continue this process for all elements and return the count.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(2^n)***
  - Generating all subsets of an array of length `n` involves `2^n` subsets.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***
  - The space required for the recursion stack in the worst case is proportional to the length of `nums`.

# Code
```typescript
function beautifulSubsets(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let count = 0;

    function backtrack(start: number, subset: number[]) {
        if (subset.length > 0) {
            count++;
        }

        for (let i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            let isValid = true;
            for (const num of subset) {
                if (Math.abs(num - nums[i]) === k) {
                    isValid = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isValid) {
                subset.push(nums[i]);
                backtrack(i + 1, subset);
                subset.pop();
            }
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, []);
    return count;
};
