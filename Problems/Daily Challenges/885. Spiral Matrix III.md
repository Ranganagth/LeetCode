[885. Spiral Matrix III](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iii/)

# Intuition

To traverse the grid in a clockwise spiral order starting from a given cell, we need to simulate the movement of a spiral. The movement will follow these steps:
1. Move right (east).
2. Move down (south).
3. Move left (west).
4. Move up (north).

Each direction change will be bounded by the limits of the grid and previously visited cells.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a list to store the coordinates in the order they are visited.
   - Use a set to keep track of visited cells.
   - Define the movement directions (right, down, left, up).

2. **Simulation**:
   - Start from the initial cell.
   - Move in the current direction.
   - If the movement goes out of bounds or encounters a visited cell, change direction.
   - Continue until all cells are visited.

3. **Direction Handling**:
   - Define direction vectors for right, down, left, and up.
   - Update the direction in a cyclic manner (right → down → left → up).

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(rows * cols)*** – Each cell is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(rows * cols)*** – To store the coordinates of all cells.

# Code

```typescript
function spiralMatrixIII(rows: number, cols: number, startRow: number, startCol: number): number[][] {
    const totalCells: number = rows * cols;
    const path: number[][] = [[startRow, startCol]];

    if (totalCells === 1) {
        return path;
    }

    for (let stepIncrease = 1; ; stepIncrease += 2) {
        const directions: [number, number, number][] = [
            [0, 1, stepIncrease],
            [1, 0, stepIncrease],
            [0, -1, stepIncrease + 1],
            [-1, 0, stepIncrease + 1]
        ];

        for (const [rowIncrement, colIncrement, steps] of directions) {
            let stepsRemaining = steps;

            while (stepsRemaining-- > 0) {
                startRow += rowIncrement;
                startCol += colIncrement;

                if (startRow >= 0 && startRow < rows && startCol >= 0 && startCol < cols) {
                    path.push([startRow, startCol]);
                    if (path.length === totalCells) {
                        return path;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};

```

## Example usage:
```typescript
console.log(spiralOrder(1, 4, 0, 0)); // Output: [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]]
console.log(spiralOrder(5, 6, 1, 4)); // Output: [[1,4],[1,5],[2,5],[2,4],[2,3],[1,3],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[3,5],[3,4],[3,3],[3,2],[2,2],[1,2],[0,2],[4,5],[4,4],[4,3],[4,2],[4,1],[3,1],[2,1],[1,1],[0,1],[4,0],[3,0],[2,0],[1,0],[0,0]]
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result` holds the final output of visited coordinates.
   - `visited` is used to keep track of which cells have already been visited.

2. **Direction Handling**:
   - The `directions` array defines movements in clockwise order.
   - `directionIndex` keeps track of the current movement direction.

3. **Traversal**:
   - For each cell, check if moving in the current direction is valid.
   - If not, change direction.
   - Continue until all cells are visited, adjusting the direction and position accordingly.
