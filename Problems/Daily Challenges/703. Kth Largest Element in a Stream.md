[703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/)

# Intuition:
To efficiently find the `k`th largest element in a stream of numbers, we can utilize a data structure that maintains the largest `k` elements seen so far. The best structure for this is a **min-heap** of size `k`. 

A min-heap allows us to:
1. Keep the smallest of the `k` largest elements at the root.
2. Quickly remove and replace the root when a new, larger element is added.

# Approach:
1. **Initialization**:
   - When initializing the class, we create a min-heap and populate it with the first `k` elements of the stream. If the stream has more than `k` elements, we discard elements smaller than the current root of the heap as they won't affect the `k`th largest value.

2. **Add Operation**:
   - For each new element, compare it with the root of the heap:
     - If the new element is larger than the root, remove the root and insert the new element into the heap.
   - The root of the heap will always represent the `k`th largest element.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Initialization: ***O(n log k)*** where `n` is the length of the initial stream and `k` is the size of the heap.
  - Add Operation: ***O(log k)*** for each `add` call, since inserting into a heap of size `k` takes ***O(log k)*** time.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - ***O(k)*** since we only store the `k` largest elements in the heap.

# Code

```typescript
class KthLargest {
    private minHeap: number[];
    private k: number;

    constructor(k: number, nums: number[]) {
        this.k = k;
        this.minHeap = [];

        for (let num of nums) {
            this.add(num);
        }
    }

    add(val: number): number {
        if (this.minHeap.length < this.k) {
            this.minHeap.push(val);
            this.minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b); 
        } else if (val > this.minHeap[0]) {
            this.minHeap.shift();
            this.minHeap.push(val);
            this.minHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        }
        return this.minHeap[0];
    }
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
const kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, [4, 5, 8, 2]);
console.log(kthLargest.add(3));  // return 4
console.log(kthLargest.add(5));  // return 5
console.log(kthLargest.add(10)); // return 5
console.log(kthLargest.add(9));  // return 8
console.log(kthLargest.add(4));  // return 8
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: The `KthLargest` constructor initializes the object and maintains the top `k` largest elements in the min-heap.
- **Add Operation**: Each time a new element is added via the `add` method, it's compared with the root of the heap (the current `k`th largest element). If it's larger, it replaces the root and the heap is updated accordingly. The `k`th largest element is always at the root of the min-heap.
