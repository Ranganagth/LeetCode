[1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-unique-binary-string/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to find a binary string of length `n` that does not exist in a given array `nums` of binary strings, where:
- All strings in `nums` are unique.
- There are *2ⁿ* possible binary strings of length `n`, but only `n` are given.

Using **Cantor's Diagonalization**, we can ensure that the constructed binary string is guaranteed to differ from every string in `nums` at least one position.

# Approach

1. **Diagonalization**:
    - For each index `i` (from `0` to `n-1`), the constructed binary string flips the `i-th` character of the `i-th` string in `nums`. This ensures that the resulting string is different from every string in `nums` at the `i-th` position.
	
2. **Guaranteed Uniqueness**:
    - Since the constructed string differs from every string at one unique position, it is not present in `nums`.
	
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Handle cases where `nums` contains the maximum number of unique binary strings of length `n`. The diagonalization still works because *2ⁿ > n*.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***:
    - We iterate through the given `nums` once to construct the new string.
	
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***:
    - The output string requires ***O(n)*** space.

# Code

```typescript
function findDifferentBinaryString(nums: string[]): string {
    const n = nums.length;
    let result = "";

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Flip the i-th character of the i-th string
        result += nums[i][i] === '0' ? '1' : '0';
    }

    return result;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
nums = ["01", "10"];
```

**Execution**:

1. Length of `nums` (`n`) = 2.
2. Constructed binary string:
    - For `i = 0`: Flip `nums[0][0]` → '1'.
    - For `i = 1`: Flip `nums[1][1]` → '1'.
3. Result: `"11"`.
4. `"11"` is not in `nums`.

**Output**:

```typescript
"11"
```

### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
nums = ["00", "01"];
```

**Execution**:

1. Length of `nums` (`n`) = 2.
2. Constructed binary string:
    - For `i = 0`: Flip `nums[0][0]` → '1'.
    - For `i = 1`: Flip `nums[1][1]` → '1'.
3. Result: `"11"`.
4. `"11"` is not in `nums`.

**Output**:

```typescript
"11"
```

### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
nums = ["111", "011", "001"];
```

**Execution**:

1. Length of `nums` (`n`) = 3.
2. Constructed binary string:
    - For `i = 0`: Flip `nums[0][0]` → '0'.
    - For `i = 1`: Flip `nums[1][1]` → '1'.
    - For `i = 2`: Flip `nums[2][2]` → '1'.
3. Result: `"011"`.
4. `"011"` is not in `nums`.

**Output**:

```typescript
"011"
```

## **Why Cantor's Diagonalization Works**

- By flipping the `i-th` bit of the `i-th` string in `nums`, we ensure that the constructed string is not equal to any string in `nums` at the `i-th` position.
- This guarantees that the constructed string is unique and does not appear in `nums`.

---

## **Edge Cases**

1. **Minimum Input**:
    - If `n = 1` and `nums = ["0"]`, the output is `"1"`.
    - If `nums = ["1"]`, the output is `"0"`.
	
2. **Maximum Input**:
    - *n = 16*, the algorithm still works efficiently as it processes at most 16 iterations.
	
3. **All Binary Strings Except One**:
    - If `nums` contains all *n* unique binary strings, the diagonalized string will still differ.
