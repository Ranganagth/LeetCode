[2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimized-maximum-of-products-distributed-to-any-store/)


# Intuition
We aim to minimize the maximum number of products any single store receives when distributing `m` product types across `n` retail stores. Each store can only receive one type of product but can receive any amount from that product type's quantity. Our goal is to spread the products in a way that no store ends up with a disproportionately large number of products. This can be done using a binary search strategy on the possible values for the maximum distribution per store, allowing us to minimize that value effectively.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search on the Maximum**:
   - Set up a binary search on `x`, the maximum number of products any store should receive.
   - The lower bound (`low`) is `1` (minimum possible products per store), and the upper bound (`high`) is the maximum quantity in the `quantities` array (since one store can take all products of a type).

2. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For a given `x`, check if it is possible to distribute the products such that no store receives more than `x` products.
   - For each product type `quantities[i]`, calculate the minimum number of stores required to keep the store count for this product type within `x` products:
     - Stores needed for `quantities[i]` is `ceil(quantities[i] / x)`, which simplifies to `Math.ceil(quantities[i] / x)`.
   - Sum up the required stores for each product type and check if the total is within `n`.

3. **Binary Search Update**:
   - If it’s feasible to distribute the products with `x` as the maximum, then it’s possible with larger values as well. So, reduce the upper bound.
   - If it’s not feasible, increase the lower bound.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The binary search narrows down on the smallest feasible `x` that allows the distribution to satisfy all constraints.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m ⋅ log(max))***, where `m` is the number of product types, and `max` is the maximum quantity in `quantities`. This complexity arises from the binary search over the range `[1, max]` and the linear scan over `quantities` for each binary search check.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only use a fixed amount of extra space.

# Code

```typescript
function minimizedMaximum(n: number, quantities: number[]): number {
    // Helper function to check if we can distribute products with max `x` per store
    const canDistribute = (x: number): boolean => {
        let storesNeeded = 0;
        for (const quantity of quantities) {
            storesNeeded += Math.ceil(quantity / x);
            if (storesNeeded > n) return false; // Early exit if we exceed available stores
        }
        return storesNeeded <= n;
    };

    // Binary search on the possible maximum number of products per store
    let low = 1, high = Math.max(...quantities);
    while (low < high) {
        const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
        if (canDistribute(mid)) {
            high = mid; // Try to minimize x
        } else {
            low = mid + 1; // Increase x as it's not feasible with current mid
        }
    }

    return low;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
- **Input**: `n = 6`, `quantities = [11,6]`
- **Binary Search**:
  - `low = 1`, `high = 11`
  - Midpoint `x = 3`:
    - Products of type 0: `Math.ceil(11 / 3) = 4` stores.
    - Products of type 1: `Math.ceil(6 / 3) = 2` stores.
    - Total stores required = 6 (exactly `n`), so `x = 3` is feasible.
  - Result: `3`

#### Example 2
- **Input**: `n = 7`, `quantities = [15,10,10]`
- **Binary Search**:
  - `low = 1`, `high = 15`
  - Midpoint `x = 5`:
    - Products of type 0: `Math.ceil(15 / 5) = 3` stores.
    - Products of type 1: `Math.ceil(10 / 5) = 2` stores.
    - Products of type 2: `Math.ceil(10 / 5) = 2` stores.
    - Total stores required = 7, so `x = 5` is feasible.
  - Result: `5`

#### Example 3
- **Input**: `n = 1`, `quantities = [100000]`
- Since there's only one store, it must take all products, so `x = 100000`.

### Explanation of Key Steps
1. **Binary Search and Feasibility**: By conducting a binary search on `x`, we balance between minimizing the max load on any store and distributing products feasibly.
2. **Efficiency with Early Exit**: During the feasibility check, if we exceed `n` stores early, we stop, enhancing efficiency.
3. **Final Result**: Binary search ensures we find the smallest possible `x` that allows for feasible distribution.
