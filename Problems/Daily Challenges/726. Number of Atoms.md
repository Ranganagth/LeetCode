[726. Number of Atoms](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to parse a chemical formula string and count the occurrences of each element. The formula may include nested parentheses, indicating groups of elements with multipliers. To solve this, we can use a stack to manage the nested structures and handle multipliers appropriately.

# Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a stack to manage the counts of elements in different nested levels.
   - Use a map to keep track of the counts of elements at each level.

2. **Parsing the Formula**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - If the character is '(', push a new map onto the stack to start a new nested level.
   - If the character is ')', pop the top map from the stack, parse the following digits to get the multiplier, and update the counts in the previous level map by multiplying the counts from the popped map.
   - If the character is an uppercase letter, it marks the start of an element name. Continue to the next character if it's a lowercase letter to complete the element name.
   - Parse any digits following the element name to get the count (default is 1 if no digits follow).

3. **Final Count**:
   - After processing the entire formula, the final map on the stack contains the counts of all elements.
   - Sort the elements alphabetically and format the result string.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the length of the formula. We iterate through each character of the formula once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the stack and maps used to store counts.

# Code

```typescript
function countOfAtoms(formula: string): string {
    let i = 0;
    const n = formula.length;

    function parse(): Map<string, number> {
        let stack: Map<string, number>[] = [new Map()];

        while (i < n) {
            if (formula[i] === '(') {
                i++;
                stack.push(new Map());
            } else if (formula[i] === ')') {
                i++;
                let numStart = i;
                while (i < n && isDigit(formula[i])) i++;
                let multiplier = numStart < i ? parseInt(formula.slice(numStart, i)) : 1;

                let top = stack.pop()!;
                let current = stack[stack.length - 1];
                for (let [element, count] of top) {
                    current.set(element, (current.get(element) || 0) + count * multiplier);
                }
            } else {
                let nameStart = i++;
                while (i < n && isLowerCase(formula[i])) i++;
                let name = formula.slice(nameStart, i);
                
                let numStart = i;
                while (i < n && isDigit(formula[i])) i++;
                let count = numStart < i ? parseInt(formula.slice(numStart, i)) : 1;
                
                let current = stack[stack.length - 1];
                current.set(name, (current.get(name) || 0) + count);
            }
        }

        return stack.pop()!;
    }

    function isDigit(ch: string): boolean {
        return '0' <= ch && ch <= '9';
    }

    function isLowerCase(ch: string): boolean {
        return 'a' <= ch && ch <= 'z';
    }

    let elementCount = parse();
    let result = Array.from(elementCount.entries())
                      .sort(([a], [b]) => a.localeCompare(b))
                      .map(([element, count]) => element + (count > 1 ? count : ''))
                      .join('');
    return result;
};

```

### Explanation

1. **parse() Function**:
   - Uses a stack to manage maps of element counts at different nested levels.
   - Iterates through the formula, handling each type of character (parentheses, element names, and digits) accordingly.

2. **isDigit() and isLowerCase() Functions**:
   - Helper functions to check if a character is a digit or a lowercase letter.

3. **Final Count and Output**:
   - After parsing, the final map on the stack contains the overall counts of elements.
   - Sort the elements alphabetically and format the result string, appending counts if they are greater than one.
