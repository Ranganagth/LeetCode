[1905. Count Sub Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-sub-islands/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to count the number of sub-islands in `grid2` that are completely covered by corresponding islands in `grid1`. A sub-island in `grid2` is defined as an island where every land cell (1) in `grid2` is also a land cell in `grid1`.

# Approach
1. **DFS Traversal**: We use a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore each island in `grid2`. For each land cell found in `grid2`, we start a DFS to explore the entire island.
2. **Sub-Island Verification**: During the DFS, we check if the corresponding cells in `grid1` are also land. If we find any part of the island in `grid2` that does not correspond to land in `grid1`, the entire island is not considered a sub-island.
3. **Counting Sub-Islands**: We count an island in `grid2` as a sub-island if the entire island passes the verification process.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m * n)***, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grids. Each cell is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m * n)*** in the worst case due to the recursive DFS call stack.

# Code
```typescript
function countSubIslands(grid1: number[][], grid2: number[][]): number {
    let rowCount = grid1.length;
    let colCount = grid1[0].length;
    let subIslandCount = 0;

    for (let row = 0; row < rowCount; ++row) {
        for (let col = 0; col < colCount; ++col) {
            if (grid2[row][col] === 1 && dfs(grid1, grid2, row, col)) {
                subIslandCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    return subIslandCount;
}

function dfs(grid1: number[][], grid2: number[][], i: number, j: number): boolean {
    let rowCount = grid1.length;
    let colCount = grid1[0].length;
    let isSubIsland = true;

    if (grid1[i][j] === 0) {
        isSubIsland = false;
    }

    grid2[i][j] = 0;

    const directions = [
        [0, 1],
        [0, -1],
        [1, 0],
        [-1, 0],
    ];

    for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
        let newX = i + dx;
        let newY = j + dy;

        if (newX >= 0 && newX < rowCount && newY >= 0 && newY < colCount && grid2[newX][newY] === 1) {
            if (!dfs(grid1, grid2, newX, newY)) {
                isSubIsland = false;
            }
        }
    }

    return isSubIsland;
};
```

### Explanation
- The `countSubIslands` function iterates through each cell in `grid2`. If it finds a land cell (`1`), it starts a DFS to explore the entire island.
- The `dfs` function recursively checks the island, marking visited cells in `grid2` by setting them to `0`. It checks if the corresponding cells in `grid1` are also land. If any part of the island in `grid2` is not covered by land in `grid1`, `isSubIsland` is set to `false`.
- Finally, the count of valid sub-islands is returned.
