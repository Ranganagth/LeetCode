[260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

# Intuition
We can use bitwise operations to solve this problem efficiently. The key insight is to utilize the XOR operation, which has some useful properties:
1. a ⊕ a = 0 (XOR of a number with itself is zero)
2. a ⊕ 0 = a (XOR of a number with zero is the number itself)
3. XOR is both commutative and associative.

# Approach
1. **Initial XOR**:
   - XOR all the elements in the array. This will cancel out all the elements that appear twice and leave us with the XOR of the two unique elements.
   - Let's call this result `xor_sum`.

2. **Finding the Differentiating Bit**:
   - Find any bit that is set (i.e., 1) in `xor_sum`. This bit must be set in one of the unique elements and not in the other because they are different.
   - We can use `xor_sum & -xor_sum` to isolate the rightmost set bit in `xor_sum`.

3. **Partitioning and XORing**:
   - Use this differentiating bit to partition the array into two groups: one group where the bit is set and another where it is not.
   - XOR all the elements in each group separately. This will cancel out the elements appearing twice within each group, leaving us with the two unique elements.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we use only a few extra variables.

# Code
```typescript
function singleNumber(nums: number[]): number[] {
    let xor_sum = 0;
    
    for (const num of nums) {
        xor_sum ^= num;
    }

    const rightmost_set_bit = xor_sum & -xor_sum;

    let num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
    for (const num of nums) {
        if ((num & rightmost_set_bit) !== 0) {
            num1 ^= num;
        } else {
            num2 ^= num;
        }
    }

    return [num1, num2];
};
