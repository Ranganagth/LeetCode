[3445. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-ii/)

# Intuition

We are asked to find a **substring of length at least `k`** in which:
* Character `a` occurs **odd** number of times
* Character `b` occurs **even** number of times
* The difference `freq[a] - freq[b]` is **maximized**

The brute-force way (check all substrings of size ≥ `k`) is too slow for input size up to `30,000`. So we need a smarter approach.

This solution applies:
* A **sliding window-like technique**
* With tracking of prefix frequency differences and **bitmask parity state** of (a, b)
* And finds the best valid prefix to maximize the difference under the required parity constraints.

# Approach

1. Loop through **all pairs of characters `a` and `b`** (from '0' to '4') where `a != b`.

2. For each character pair:
   * Maintain prefix counts of `a` and `b`
   * Track `best[status]` where:
     * `status` is a 2-bit number representing parity:
       * Bit 1: parity of `cnt_a` (odd = 1)
       * Bit 0: parity of `cnt_b` (even = 0)
   * At each step (`right` index), update `cnt_a` and `cnt_b`
   * Maintain a left index (`left`) such that substring length is ≥ `k`
   * Store the best value of `(cnt_a - cnt_b)` seen so far for each status
   * For a new state, check if we’ve seen a compatible earlier prefix that satisfies the required parities

3. Use this to compute the maximum valid `freq[a] - freq[b]`.

# Complexity

* **Time Complexity:**
  $O(25 * n)$
  (There are 5 digits → 25 pairs → loop once over `n`)

* **Space Complexity:**
  $O(1)$ auxiliary space (only arrays of size 4 used repeatedly)

# Code

```typescript
function maxDifference(s: string, k: number): number {
    const n = s.length;
    let ans = -Infinity;

    const getStatus = (cnt_a: number, cnt_b: number): number => {
        return ((cnt_a & 1) << 1) | (cnt_b & 1);  // status: 2-bit number
    };

    const chars = ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4"];

    for (const a of chars) {
        for (const b of chars) {
            if (a === b) continue;

            const best = [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity];
            let cnt_a = 0, cnt_b = 0;
            let prev_a = 0, prev_b = 0;
            let left = -1;

            for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
                if (s[right] === a) cnt_a++;
                if (s[right] === b) cnt_b++;

                while (right - left >= k && cnt_b - prev_b >= 2) {
                    const leftStatus = getStatus(prev_a, prev_b);
                    best[leftStatus] = Math.min(best[leftStatus], prev_a - prev_b);

                    left++;
                    if (s[left] === a) prev_a++;
                    if (s[left] === b) prev_b++;
                }

                const rightStatus = getStatus(cnt_a, cnt_b);
                const targetStatus = rightStatus ^ 0b10;  // want left a's parity to be opposite

                if (best[targetStatus] !== Infinity) {
                    ans = Math.max(ans, (cnt_a - cnt_b) - best[targetStatus]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return ans === -Infinity ? -1 : ans;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:

```ts
s = "12233", k = 4
```

* Only one valid substring of size ≥ 4: `"12233"`
* freq('1') = 1 (odd), freq('3') = 2 (even)
* diff = 1 - 2 = **-1**
* **Return -1**

#### Example 2:

```ts
s = "1122211", k = 3
```

* Consider substring `"11222"`:

  * freq('2') = 3 (odd)
  * freq('1') = 2 (even)
  * diff = 3 - 2 = **1**
* This is valid, and the best possible
* **Return 1**

### **Summary**

This solution:

* Efficiently computes the optimal difference using frequency prefix tracking and parity states
* Is linear per character-pair, and suitable for large input sizes
* Smartly reduces unnecessary comparisons via status mapping and difference tracking
