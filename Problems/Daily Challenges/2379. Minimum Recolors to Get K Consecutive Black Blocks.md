[2379. Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-recolors-to-get-k-consecutive-black-blocks/)

# Intuition

We need to ensure that at least **one substring** of length `k` in `blocks` consists entirely of `'B'` (black blocks). To achieve this, we can **recolor** `'W'` (white blocks) into `'B'`. Our goal is to determine the **minimum number of recoloring operations** required.

Instead of checking all possible substrings (which would be inefficient), we can use the **sliding window technique** to efficiently track the number of `'W'` blocks within a window of size `k`.

# Approach (Sliding Window)

1. **Initialize a sliding window of size `k`**:
    - Count the number of **white blocks ('W')** in the first window of size `k`.
2. **Slide the window across `blocks`**:
    - As we move the window right, update the count of white blocks by:
        - Removing the leftmost character.
        - Adding the new rightmost character.
    - Track the **minimum number of 'W' blocks in any window**.
3. **Return the minimum number of operations required**.


# Complexity Analysis

- **Sliding window runs in O(n)** since each character is processed at most twice (once entering and once leaving the window).
- **Overall Complexity:** ***O(n)***, which is optimal given *n ≤ 100*.

# Code

```typescript
function minimumRecolors(blocks: string, k: number): number {
    let minOperations = Infinity;
    let currentWhiteCount = 0;

    // Count 'W' in the first window of size k
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (blocks[i] === 'W') currentWhiteCount++;
    }
    minOperations = currentWhiteCount;

    // Sliding window: Move right while updating the count of 'W'
    for (let i = k; i < blocks.length; i++) {
        if (blocks[i - k] === 'W') currentWhiteCount--; // Remove leftmost char
        if (blocks[i] === 'W') currentWhiteCount++; // Add rightmost char

        minOperations = Math.min(minOperations, currentWhiteCount);
    }

    return minOperations;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input**

```typescript
blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
```

#### **Processing**

1. **Initial window (`WBBWWBB`)**: **3** white blocks (`W`).
2. Slide the window and update the count:
    - `"BBWWBBW"` → **3** white blocks.
    - `"BWWBBWB"` → **3** white blocks.
    - `"WWBBWBW"` → **4** white blocks.
    - `"WBBWBW"` → **3** white blocks (minimum found).

#### **Output**

```typescript
3
```

We need **3** recolors to make any **7 consecutive** blocks fully black.

### **Example 2**

#### **Input**

```typescript
blocks = "WBWBBBW", k = 2
```

#### **Processing**

- A valid sequence `"BB"` already exists.
- **No recoloring needed**.

#### **Output**

```typescript
0
```

## **Why This Approach?**

- **Efficient**: Uses **O(n) sliding window** instead of **O(n²) brute force**.
- **Simple & Optimal**: Tracks `W` count dynamically instead of recalculating each window.
- **Works for all cases**: Finds the minimum operations required.

This ensures the **fastest possible solution** for the given constraints.
