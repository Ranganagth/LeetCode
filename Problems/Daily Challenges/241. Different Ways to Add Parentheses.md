[241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/)

# Intuition

To solve the problem of finding all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators in a given expression, we can use a divide-and-conquer approach. The idea is to split the expression at each operator, recursively solve the sub-expressions, and then combine the results from the left and right sub-expressions using the operator. This approach efficiently handles the overlapping subproblems by using memoization to store previously computed results of sub-expressions.

# Approach

1. **Divide and Conquer**:
   - Iterate through the expression to find operators.
   - For each operator, split the expression into a left part and a right part.
   - Recursively compute the results for the left and right parts.
   - Combine the results of the left and right parts using the current operator.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the expression is just a number (no operators), return it as the only result.

3. **Memoization**:
   - Use a dictionary to store the results of already computed sub-expressions to avoid redundant calculations.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is difficult to express exactly due to the varying nature of the expression. In the worst case, it can be exponential, ***O(4ⁿ / n(³/²))***, where n is the length of the expression. This is because each split results in two subproblems, and there are a combinatorial number of ways to split the expression.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)*** for the recursion stack and memoization storage, where n is the length of the expression.

# Code
```typescript
function diffWaysToCompute(expression: string): number[] {
    const memo = new Map<string, number[]>();

    function compute(expression: string): number[] {
        if (memo.has(expression)) {
            return memo.get(expression)!;
        }

        const result: number[] = [];

        for (let i = 0; i < expression.length; i++) {
            const char = expression[i];

            if (char === '+' || char === '-' || char === '*') {
                const left = compute(expression.slice(0, i));
                const right = compute(expression.slice(i + 1));

                for (const l of left) {
                    for (const r of right) {
                        if (char === '+') {
                            result.push(l + r);
                        } else if (char === '-') {
                            result.push(l - r);
                        } else if (char === '*') {
                            result.push(l * r);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if (result.length === 0) {
            result.push(parseInt(expression));
        }

        memo.set(expression, result);
        return result;
    }

    return compute(expression);
};

```

### Explanation

1. **Memoization Map**:
   - `memo` is used to store results of sub-expressions to avoid redundant calculations.

2. **Compute Function**:
   - This function takes an expression, checks if the result is already in the memoization map.
   - If not, it iterates through the expression, splitting at each operator.
   - For each operator, it recursively computes results for the left and right parts.
   - It combines the results using the operator and stores the result in the memoization map.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If no operators are found in the expression, it is a single number. Convert it to an integer and return it as the only result.

4. **Return Results**:
   - Calls `compute` with the full expression and returns the results.
