[3372. Maximize the Number of Target Nodes After Connecting Trees I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-the-number-of-target-nodes-after-connecting-trees-i/)
# Intuition

The core idea is to break down the problem into smaller, precomputable parts. When we connect a node `i` from the first tree to a node `j` from the second tree, the total number of targetable nodes from `i` in the combined structure comes from two sources:

1.  **Nodes in the first tree:** These are nodes reachable from `i` within distance `k` *solely within the first tree*.
2.  **Nodes in the second tree:** These are nodes reachable from `j` within distance `k-1` *solely within the second tree*, because the new edge `(i, j)` consumes one unit of distance.

If we can precompute these counts efficiently for all possible starting nodes in both trees, then for each query (connecting `i` from tree1 to `j` from tree2), we can simply sum these precomputed values. The overall maximum for a given `i` in tree1 would then be the maximum sum over all possible `j` in tree2.

# Approach

1.  **Graph Construction:**
    * `buildGraph(edges, size)`: A utility function to convert the given edge lists into adjacency lists (Map<number, number[]>) for easy traversal.

2.  **All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) and Target Counts Precomputation:**
    * `computeAPSPAndTargetCounts(graph, size, maxK)`: This is the crucial precomputation step. For each node `startNode` in a given `graph`:
        * It performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from `startNode` to calculate the shortest distance `dist[startNode][currentNode]` to every other `currentNode` in the graph.
        * Simultaneously, it counts the number of nodes `targetCounts[startNode]` that are reachable from `startNode` within `maxK` distance.
        * **For `graph1`:** This function is called with `k` as `maxK` to get `dist1` and `targetCounts1`. `targetCounts1[i]` will directly store the number of nodes reachable from node `i` within distance `k` in the first tree.
        * **For `graph2`:** A slightly modified approach is used to store `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[j][d_val]`. This 2D array stores, for each node `j` in `graph2`, the cumulative count of nodes reachable within distance `d_val`. This is done because when connecting `i` and `j`, nodes in `graph2` are reachable from `i` if their distance from `j` is $\leq k-1$. By storing cumulative counts, we can directly look up `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[j][k-1]`.

3.  **Calculate Maximum Target Nodes for each `i` in `graph1`:**
    * Initialize `answer` array of size `n` with zeros.
    * Iterate through each node `i` from `0` to `n-1` (nodes in `graph1`):
        * Initialize `maxNodesFor_i = 0`.
        * Iterate through each node `j` from `0` to `m-1` (nodes in `graph2`):
            * `currentTotal = targetCounts1[i]`: This accounts for all nodes reachable within `graph1` from `i` within distance `k`.
            * `remainingKForGraph2 = k - 1`: This is the remaining distance budget for traversing `graph2` after using 1 edge to connect `i` and `j`.
            * If `remainingKForGraph2 >= 0`: Add `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[j][remainingKForGraph2]` to `currentTotal`. This accounts for nodes reachable within `graph2` from `j` within distance `k-1`.
            * Update `maxNodesFor_i = Math.max(maxNodesFor_i, currentTotal)`.
        * Store `maxNodesFor_i` in `answer[i]`.

4.  **Return `answer` array.**

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**
    * `buildGraph`: $O(N + M)$
    * `computeAPSPAndTargetCounts` (for `graph1`): Each of the `N` BFS traversals takes $O(N)$ time (since it's a tree, number of edges is $N-1$). So, $O(N^2)$.
    * `computeAPSPAndTargetCounts` (for `graph2` with cumulative counts): Each of the `M` BFS traversals takes $O(M)$ time. The cumulative sum calculation is $O(k)$. So, $O(M^2 + M \cdot k)$. In the worst case, $k$ can be up to $M$, making it $O(M^2)$.
    * Main loop for combining results: $N$ iterations for `i`, $M$ iterations for `j`. Inside the loop, lookups are $O(1)$. So, $O(N \cdot M)$.
    * **Total Time Complexity:** $O(N^2 + M^2 + N \cdot M)$. Given $N, M \leq 1000$, this is approximately $1000^2 + 1000^2 + 1000 \cdot 1000 = 3 \cdot 10^6$ operations, which is efficient enough.

* **Space Complexity:**
    * `graph1`, `graph2`: $O(N + M)$
    * `dist1`: $O(N^2)$
    * `targetCounts1`: $O(N)$
    * `dist2`: $O(M^2)$
    * `targetCounts2_at_dist_d`: $O(M \cdot k)$
    * `answer`: $O(N)$
    * **Total Space Complexity:** $O(N^2 + M^2 + M \cdot k)$. Given $N, M \leq 1000$, this is approximately $1000^2 + 1000^2 + 1000 \cdot 1000 = 3 \cdot 10^6$ integers, which is feasible.

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

**Example:**
`edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]]`, `edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]]`, `k = 1`

**Tree 1:**
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (n=5)
Edges: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)
Node 0 is connected to 1,2,3,4. All other nodes are leaves connected to 0.

**Tree 2:**
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3 (m=4)
Edges: (0,1), (1,2), (2,3)
This is a simple path: 0-1-2-3

**k = 1**

**Step 1: Precompute `targetCounts1_k` (for Tree 1, distance $\le k=1$)**
* `targetCounts1_k[0]`: From node 0, reachable within distance 1 are: 0 (itself), 1, 2, 3, 4. So, `targetCounts1_k[0] = 5`.
* `targetCounts1_k[1]`: From node 1, reachable within distance 1 are: 1 (itself), 0. So, `targetCounts1_k[1] = 2`.
* `targetCounts1_k[2]`: From node 2, reachable within distance 1 are: 2 (itself), 0. So, `targetCounts1_k[2] = 2`.
* `targetCounts1_k[3]`: From node 3, reachable within distance 1 are: 3 (itself), 0. So, `targetCounts1_k[3] = 2`.
* `targetCounts1_k[4]`: From node 4, reachable within distance 1 are: 4 (itself), 0. So, `targetCounts1_k[4] = 2`.

`targetCounts1_k = [5, 2, 2, 2, 2]`


**Step 2: Precompute `targetCounts2_at_dist_d` (for Tree 2, for distances $\le k=1$)**

`remainingKForGraph2 = k - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`. So we mostly care about `d_val = 0`.

Let's compute `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[j][0]` for each `j`:
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[0][0]`: From node 0, reachable within distance 0 is: 0 (itself). Count = 1.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[1][0]`: From node 1, reachable within distance 0 is: 1 (itself). Count = 1.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[2][0]`: From node 2, reachable within distance 0 is: 2 (itself). Count = 1.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[3][0]`: From node 3, reachable within distance 0 is: 3 (itself). Count = 1.

(For completeness, let's also compute for `d_val = 1` just in case, though it won't be used for `k=1` connection)
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[0][1]`: From node 0, reachable within distance 1 are: 0, 1. Count = 2.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[1][1]`: From node 1, reachable within distance 1 are: 0, 1, 2. Count = 3.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[2][1]`: From node 2, reachable within distance 1 are: 1, 2, 3. Count = 3.
* `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[3][1]`: From node 3, reachable within distance 1 are: 2, 3. Count = 2.

So, `targetCounts2_at_dist_d` will be (showing only up to `d_val = 1`):
`targetCounts2_at_dist_d[0] = [1, 2]`
`targetCounts2_at_dist_d[1] = [1, 3]`
`targetCounts2_at_dist_d[2] = [1, 3]`
`targetCounts2_at_dist_d[3] = [1, 2]`


**Step 3: Calculate `answer` array**

`remainingKForGraph2 = k - 1 = 0`. So we will use `targetCounts2_at_dist_d[j][0]`.

**For `i = 0` (from Tree 1):**
* `targetCounts1_k[0] = 5`
* Try connecting to `j = 0` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 5 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[0][0] = 5 + 1 = 6`
* Try connecting to `j = 1` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 5 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[1][0] = 5 + 1 = 6`
* Try connecting to `j = 2` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 5 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[2][0] = 5 + 1 = 6`
* Try connecting to `j = 3` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 5 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[3][0] = 5 + 1 = 6`
* `maxNodesFor_0 = 6`. `answer[0] = 6`.

**For `i = 1` (from Tree 1):**
* `targetCounts1_k[1] = 2`
* Try connecting to `j = 0` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 2 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[0][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
* Try connecting to `j = 1` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 2 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[1][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
* Try connecting to `j = 2` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 2 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[2][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
* Try connecting to `j = 3` (Tree 2): `currentTotal = 2 + targetCounts2_at_dist_d[3][0] = 2 + 1 = 3`
* `maxNodesFor_1 = 3`. `answer[1] = 3`.

**For `i = 2` (from Tree 1):**
* `targetCounts1_k[2] = 2`
* All connections will yield `2 + 1 = 3`. `maxNodesFor_2 = 3`. `answer[2] = 3`.

**For `i = 3` (from Tree 1):**
* `targetCounts1_k[3] = 2`
* All connections will yield `2 + 1 = 3`. `maxNodesFor_3 = 3`. `answer[3] = 3`.

**For `i = 4` (from Tree 1):**
* `targetCounts1_k[4] = 2`
* All connections will yield `2 + 1 = 3`. `maxNodesFor_4 = 3`. `answer[4] = 3`.

**Final `answer = [6, 3, 3, 3, 3]`**
