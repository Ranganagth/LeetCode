[802. Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/)

# Intuition

The problem requires identifying "safe nodes" in a directed graph:
1. A node is "safe" if every path starting from it eventually leads to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges).
2. We can think of the problem in terms of cycles:
    - If a node is part of a cycle, it's unsafe.
    - If a node leads to a cycle, it's also unsafe.
3. Conversely, nodes that eventually lead to terminal nodes are safe.

Using **reverse graph traversal**, we can efficiently determine which nodes are safe:
- Instead of checking where a node points, analyze where it comes from.
- This helps identify terminal nodes and propagate the safe status backward.

# Approach

1. **Reverse Graph Construction**:
    - Build a reversed graph (`reversedGraph`), where the direction of all edges is reversed.
    - Count the outgoing edges (`outDegree`) for each node in the original graph.
	
2. **Topological Sort Using a Queue**:
    - Initialize a queue with terminal nodes (nodes with zero outgoing edges).
    - Process nodes in the queue:
        - For each node, mark it as "safe."
        - Reduce the `outDegree` of its predecessors in the reversed graph.
        - If any predecessor's `outDegree` becomes 0, add it to the queue (it becomes safe).
	
3. **Result**:    
    - Collect all nodes marked as safe and return them in sorted order.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Constructing the reversed graph: **O(E)**, where *E* is the number of edges.
    - Topological sort traversal: **O(V + E)**, where *V* is the number of nodes.
    - Total: ***O(V + E)***.
	
- **Space Complexity**:
    - Reversed graph storage: **O(E)**.
    - Queue and result storage: **O(V)**.
    - Total: ***O(V + E)***.

# Code

```typescript
function eventualSafeNodes(graph: number[][]): number[] {
    const n = graph.length;

    // Step 1: Reverse the graph and calculate outDegrees
    const reversedGraph: number[][] = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const outDegree: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);

    for (let u = 0; u < n; u++) {
        for (const v of graph[u]) {
            reversedGraph[v].push(u); // Reverse the edge
        }
        outDegree[u] = graph[u].length;
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize queue with terminal nodes
    const queue: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (outDegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Process the queue to find safe nodes
    const safe: boolean[] = new Array(n).fill(false);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const node = queue.shift()!;
        safe[node] = true;

        for (const neighbor of reversedGraph[node]) {
            outDegree[neighbor]--;
            if (outDegree[neighbor] === 0) {
                queue.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Collect and return all safe nodes
    const result: number[] = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (safe[i]) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
};

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const graph = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [5], [0], [5], [], []];
console.log(eventualSafeNodes(graph));
```

**Execution**:

1. **Reversed Graph**:
    - `reversedGraph = [ [3], [0], [0, 1], [1], [], [2, 4], [] ]`
    - `outDegree = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
	
2. **Queue Initialization**:
    - Terminal nodes: `[5, 6]`.
	
3. **Queue Processing**:
    - Mark `5` and `6` as safe.
    - Propagate safe status backward:
        - Reduce `outDegree` for predecessors.
        - Add nodes with `outDegree = 0` to the queue.
		
4. **Result**:    
    - Safe nodes: `[2, 4, 5, 6]`.

**Output**:

```typescript
[2, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const graph = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4], [0, 4], []];
console.log(eventualSafeNodes(graph));
```

**Execution**:

1. **Reversed Graph**:
    - `reversedGraph = [ [3], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 2, 3] ]`
    - `outDegree = [4, 2, 2, 2, 0]`.
	
2. **Queue Initialization**:
    - Terminal node: `[4]`.
	
3. **Queue Processing**:
    - Mark `4` as safe.
    - Propagate safe status backward.
	
4. **Result**:
    - Safe nodes: `[4]`.

**Output**:

```typescript
[4]
```

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Node, No Edges**:
    - Input: `[[ ]]`
    - Output: `[0]` (only one terminal node).
	
2. **All Nodes in a Cycle**:
    - Input: `[[1], [2], [0]]`
    - Output: `[]` (no safe nodes).
	
3. **Large Graph**:
    - The solution efficiently handles graphs with *n = 10^4* and *E = 4 Ã— 10^4*.
