[1122. Relative Sort Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)

# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to reorder elements of `arr1` such that the elements appear in the same order as they do in `arr2`. Any elements in `arr1` that are not in `arr2` should be sorted in ascending order and appended at the end of the reordered list.

# Approach
1. **Frequency Count**: Create a frequency map to count the occurrences of each element in `arr1`.
2. **Reorder by `arr2`**: Iterate through `arr2` and collect elements in the order they appear in `arr2` using the frequency map.
3. **Sort Remaining Elements**: Identify elements in `arr1` that are not in `arr2`, sort them, and append them to the result.
4. **Combine Results**: Combine the reordered elements and the sorted remaining elements to form the final result.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n log n)*** where *n* is the length of `arr1`. This is because we need to sort the elements not present in `arr2`.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the length of `arr1`. We use additional space for the frequency map and result array.

# Code
```typescript
function relativeSortArray(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number[] {
    const frequencyMap = new Map<number, number>();
    
    for (const num of arr1) {
        frequencyMap.set(num, (frequencyMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    const result: number[] = [];
    
    for (const num of arr2) {
        const count = frequencyMap.get(num) || 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            result.push(num);
        }
        frequencyMap.delete(num);
    }
    
    const remainingElements: number[] = [];
    for (const [num, count] of frequencyMap.entries()) {
        for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            remainingElements.push(num);
        }
    }
    remainingElements.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    return result.concat(remainingElements);
};

```
