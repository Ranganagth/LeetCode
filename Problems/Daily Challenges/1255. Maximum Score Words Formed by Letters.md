[1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters/)

# Intuition
To find the maximum score of any valid set of words that can be formed using the given letters, we need to explore all possible combinations of the words. Since the number of words is relatively small (maximum of 14), we can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all subsets of words and calculate their scores. For each combination, we need to ensure that the letters are available in sufficient quantity to form the words.

# Approach
1. **Score Calculation**:
   - Create a helper function to calculate the score of a word based on the given score array.

2. **Backtracking**:
   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible combinations of words.
   - For each word, check if it can be formed using the remaining letters.
   - If it can be formed, subtract the required letters and add the word's score to the total score.
   - Continue exploring further with the updated letters and score.
   - Backtrack by adding the letters back and subtracting the word's score before moving to the next word.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When all words are considered, return the accumulated score.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use memoization to store already computed scores for specific states to avoid redundant calculations.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity is ***O(2ⁿ)***, where ***n*** is the number of words. This is because we explore all subsets of the given words.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is ***O(n)*** due to the recursion stack.

# Code
```typescript
function maxScoreWords(words: string[], letters: string[], score: number[]): number {
    const letterCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let letter of letters) {
        letterCount[letter.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
    }
    
    const wordScores = words.map(word => calculateScore(word, score));
    
    function calculateScore(word: string, score: number[]): number {
        let wordScore = 0;
        for (let char of word) {
            wordScore += score[char.charCodeAt(0) - 97];
        }
        return wordScore;
    }

    function canForm(word: string, letterCount: number[]): boolean {
        const tempCount = [...letterCount];
        for (let char of word) {
            if (tempCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 97]-- <= 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    function backtrack(index: number, currentScore: number, letterCount: number[]): number {
        if (index === words.length) {
            return currentScore;
        }
        
        let maxScore = backtrack(index + 1, currentScore, letterCount);
        
        if (canForm(words[index], letterCount)) {
            const tempCount = [...letterCount];
            for (let char of words[index]) {
                tempCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 97]--;
            }
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, backtrack(index + 1, currentScore + wordScores[index], tempCount));
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
    
    return backtrack(0, 0, letterCount);
};
