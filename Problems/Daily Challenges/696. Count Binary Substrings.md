[696. Count Binary Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-binary-substrings/)

# Intuition

A valid substring must satisfy two conditions:

1. Equal number of `0`s and `1`s.
2. All `0`s appear consecutively and all `1`s appear consecutively.

Therefore valid substrings always look like:

```
000111
0011
01
111000
10
```

They are formed only at **boundaries where characters change**.

Example:

```
00110011
```

Group consecutive characters:

```
00 | 11 | 00 | 11
```

Lengths:

```
2 , 2 , 2 , 2
```

Between every adjacent pair of groups:

```
valid substrings = min(previousGroupLength, currentGroupLength)
```

Because:

```
00 + 11 → "0011", "01"
```

Number of valid substrings = minimum size of adjacent blocks.

# Approach

1. Traverse string and count lengths of consecutive character groups.
2. Maintain:

   * `prevGroup` → previous consecutive block size.
   * `currGroup` → current consecutive block size.
3. Whenever character changes:

   * Add `min(prevGroup, currGroup)` to answer.
   * Move current group into previous.
4. Add final group contribution after loop.

No extra array needed.

# Code

```typescript
function countBinarySubstrings(s: string): number {
    let prevGroup = 0;
    let currGroup = 1;
    let ans = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {

        // same character → extend current group
        if (s[i] === s[i - 1]) {
            currGroup++;
        } else {
            // group boundary found
            ans += Math.min(prevGroup, currGroup);

            prevGroup = currGroup;
            currGroup = 1;
        }
    }

    // final boundary contribution
    ans += Math.min(prevGroup, currGroup);

    return ans;
};

```

# Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
s = "00110011"
```

Groups:

```
00 → length 2
11 → length 2
00 → length 2
11 → length 2
```

Compute:

```
min(2,2) = 2
min(2,2) = 2
min(2,2) = 2
```

Total:

```
2 + 2 + 2 = 6
```

Substrings:

```
0011
01
1100
10
0011
01
```

Output:

```
6
```

---

### Example 2

```
s = "10101"
```

Groups:

```
1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1
```

Lengths:

```
1,1,1,1,1
```

Contribution:

```
min(1,1) four times = 4
```

Substrings:

```
10
01
10
01
```

Output:

```
4
```
