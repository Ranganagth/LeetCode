[564. Find the Closest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome/)

# Intuition

Given an integer represented as a string `n`, the task is to find the closest palindrome number that isn't the number itself. The "closeness" is defined by the smallest absolute difference between the original number and the candidate palindromes. If two palindromes have the same distance from the original number, the smaller one is chosen.

# Approach

1. **Understanding Palindromes**: A palindrome reads the same backward as forward. For example, "121", "888", and "77" are palindromes.

2. **Generating Candidates**: 
    - Consider numbers that are almost similar to `n`, which could potentially form a palindrome by slightly altering the digits.
    - There are three primary candidates:
        1. **Prefix + Reversed Prefix**: Construct a palindrome by using the prefix of `n` and reversing it.
        2. **Prefix + Reversed Prefix with slight increment**: Similar to the above, but increment the prefix by one.
        3. **Prefix + Reversed Prefix with slight decrement**: Similar to the above, but decrement the prefix by one.
    - Additionally, include edge cases:
        - **Smallest palindrome with one less digit**: For example, if `n` has 3 digits, consider "99".
        - **Smallest palindrome with one more digit**: For example, if `n` has 3 digits, consider "1001".

3. **Selecting the Closest Palindrome**:
    - Compare all candidates based on their absolute difference with the original number. If two candidates have the same distance, select the smaller one.

4. **Exclusion of the Original Number**: Ensure that the original number itself isn't considered a valid palindrome candidate.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm primarily involves generating potential candidates and checking their closeness to `n`. Each candidate is derived based on a substring operation, followed by reversing the string, and finally comparing distances. These operations are linear with respect to the length of `n`, so the overall time complexity is ***O(L)***, where `L` is the length of the string `n`.

- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses a few additional variables and a set to store candidates, which is also ***O(L)***.

# Code:

```typescript
function nearestPalindromic(n: string): string {
    const originalNumber = BigInt(n);
    let closestPalindrome: bigint = BigInt(-1);

    for (const candidate of getCandidates(n)) {
        if (
            closestPalindrome === BigInt(-1) ||
            (BigInt(Math.abs(candidate - originalNumber)) < BigInt(Math.abs(closestPalindrome - originalNumber))) ||
            (BigInt(Math.abs(candidate - originalNumber)) === BigInt(Math.abs(closestPalindrome - originalNumber)) && candidate < closestPalindrome)
        ) {
            closestPalindrome = candidate;
        }
    }

    return closestPalindrome.toString();
}

function getCandidates(n: string): Set<bigint> {
    const length = n.length;
    const candidates: Set<bigint> = new Set<bigint>();

    candidates.add(BigInt(Math.pow(10, length - 1) - 1));
    candidates.add(BigInt(Math.pow(10, length) + 1));

    const firstHalf = BigInt(n.substr(0, Math.ceil(length / 2)));

    for (let i = firstHalf - BigInt(1); i <= firstHalf + BigInt(1); i++) {
        const prefix = i.toString();
        const reversedPrefix = prefix.split('').reverse().join('');
        const candidateStr = prefix + reversedPrefix.substr(length % 2);

        candidates.add(BigInt(candidateStr));
    }

    candidates.delete(BigInt(n));

    return candidates;
}
```

### Steps in the Code:
1. **`nearestPalindromic` Function**:
    - Converts the string `n` to a `BigInt` for handling large numbers.
    - Iterates over possible palindrome candidates to find the closest one.

2. **`getCandidates` Function**:
    - Generates possible palindromic candidates based on the length of `n` and its first half.
    - Considers edge cases by adding the smallest possible palindrome with one less digit and the smallest possible palindrome with one more digit.

3. **Comparison**:
    - The algorithm compares each candidate to the original number, accounting for the closest one by both distance and magnitude.
