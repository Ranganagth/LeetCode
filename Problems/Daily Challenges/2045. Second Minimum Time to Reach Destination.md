[2045. Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to find the second minimum time to travel from vertex 1 to vertex n. The challenge comes from the traffic signals, which change from green to red and vice versa every `change` minutes, affecting the travel time through the vertices.

# Approach

1. **Graph Representation**: Use adjacency lists to represent the graph.
2. **Two Distances per Vertex**: Maintain two distances for each vertex to keep track of the shortest and the second shortest distances.
3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to explore the graph. For each vertex, update the shortest and second shortest distances to its neighbors.
4. **Traffic Signal Handling**: Calculate the total time to reach the destination considering the traffic signals. If the signal is red upon reaching a vertex, wait until it turns green.
5. **Return the Second Minimum Time**: Compute the total time for the second shortest path considering the traffic signal changes.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(V + E)***, where *V* is the number of vertices and *E* is the number of edges. This is due to the BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(V + E)***, due to the storage required for the adjacency list and distances array.

# Code

```typescript
const adjacencyLists: number[][] = [];
const distances: number[][] = [];
const queue: number[][] = [];

function secondMinimum(n: number, edges: number[][], time: number, change: number): number {
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        adjacencyLists[i] = [];
    }

    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        adjacencyLists[u].push(v);
        adjacencyLists[v].push(u);
    });

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        distances[i] = [Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE];
    }
    distances[1][0] = 0;

    queue.push([1, 0]);

    while(queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentNode, currentDistance] = queue.shift()!;

        adjacencyLists[currentNode].forEach(neighbor => {
            if (currentDistance + 1 < distances[neighbor][0]) {
                distances[neighbor][0] = currentDistance + 1;
                queue.push([neighbor, currentDistance + 1]);
            } else if (distances[neighbor][0] < currentDistance + 1 && currentDistance + 1 < distances[neighbor][1]) {
                distances[neighbor][1] = currentDistance + 1;
                queue.push([neighbor, currentDistance + 1]);
            }
        });
    }

    let totalTime = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < distances[n][1]; i++) {
        totalTime += time;

        if (i < distances[n][1] - 1 && totalTime % (2 * change) >= change) {
            totalTime += 2 * change - (totalTime % change) - change;
        }
    }

    return totalTime;
}
```

### Example and Explanation

#### Example 1
**Input:**
- `n = 5`
- `edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [3, 4], [4, 5]]`
- `time = 3`
- `change = 5`

**Graph Representation:**
```
  1
 /|\
2 3 4
    |
    5
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Graph Construction:**
   The graph is constructed using adjacency lists. Each vertex has a list of its neighbors:
   ```typescript
   adjacencyLists = [
     [],       // 0 (unused)
     [2, 3, 4], // 1
     [1],      // 2
     [1, 4],   // 3
     [1, 3, 5], // 4
     [4]       // 5
   ]
   ```

2. **Initialize Distances:**
   Initialize the distances array with `Number.MAX_VALUE`:
   ```typescript
   distances = [
     [],                 // 0 (unused)
     [0, Number.MAX_VALUE],  // 1
     [Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE], // 2
     [Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE], // 3
     [Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE], // 4
     [Number.MAX_VALUE, Number.MAX_VALUE]  // 5
   ]
   ```

3. **BFS Traversal:**
   Use BFS to update the shortest and second shortest distances:
   - Start from node `1` with distance `0`.
   - From `1` to `2`, `3`, `4` takes `3` minutes each.
   - From `4` to `5` takes `3` minutes.
   - Second minimum path will be longer due to waiting at a vertex if the signal is red.
   
   After BFS, the distances array will be:
   ```typescript
   distances = [
     [],                 // 0 (unused)
     [0, Number.MAX_VALUE],  // 1
     [1, Number.MAX_VALUE],  // 2
     [1, 2],              // 3
     [1, 2],              // 4
     [2, 3]               // 5
   ]
   ```

4. **Calculate Total Time:**
   For the second minimum path from `1` to `5`:
   - Path: `1 -> 3 -> 4 -> wait -> 5`
   - Initial travel: `1 -> 3` = `3 minutes`
   - `3 -> 4` = `3 minutes` (total = `6 minutes`)
   - At `4`, wait for `4 minutes` until the signal turns green (total = `10 minutes`)
   - `4 -> 5` = `3 minutes` (total = `13 minutes`)

**Output:**
```
13
```

#### Example 2
**Input:**
- `n = 2`
- `edges = [[1, 2]]`
- `time = 3`
- `change = 2`

**Graph Representation:**
```
  1
  |
  2
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Graph Construction:**
   ```typescript
   adjacencyLists = [
     [],    // 0 (unused)
     [2],   // 1
     [1]    // 2
   ]
   ```

2. **Initialize Distances:**
   ```typescript
   distances = [
     [],                 // 0 (unused)
     [0, Number.MAX_VALUE],  // 1
     [1, Number.MAX_VALUE]   // 2
   ]
   ```

3. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Start from node `1` with distance `0`.
   - From `1` to `2` takes `3` minutes.
   - For second minimum path, travel back to `1` and then again to `2`.

   After BFS, the distances array will be:
   ``` typescript
   distances = [
     [],                 // 0 (unused)
     [0, 2],             // 1
     [1, 3]              // 2
   ]
   ```

4. **Calculate Total Time:**
   For the second minimum path from `1` to `2`:
   - Path: `1 -> 2 -> 1 -> wait -> 2`
   - Initial travel: `1 -> 2` = `3 minutes`
   - `2 -> 1` = `3 minutes` (total = `6 minutes`)
   - At `1`, wait for `2 minutes` until the signal turns green (total = `8 minutes`)
   - `1 -> 2` = `3 minutes` (total = `11 minutes`)

**Output:**
```
11
```
