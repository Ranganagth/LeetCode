[3151. Special Array I](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-array-i/)

# Intuition
To determine if an array is "special," we need to ensure that every pair of adjacent elements contains one even and one odd number. This means that the parity (even or odd nature) of each element should alternate throughout the array.

### Key Observations

1. If the array contains only **one element**, it is automatically special.
2. If there are **two or more elements**, we must check that **every adjacent pair** alternates between even and odd.
3. If at least **one adjacent pair** does not satisfy this condition, return **false**.

# Approach
4. **Iterate through the array**: Start from the first element and compare it with the next element.
5. **Check parity**: For each pair of adjacent elements, check if one is even and the other is odd.
6. **Return result**: If all adjacent pairs satisfy the condition, return `true`. If any pair fails, return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of elements in the array. We only need to traverse the array once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function isSpecialArray(nums: number[]): boolean {
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        if ((nums[i] % 2) === (nums[i + 1] % 2)) {
            return false; // Adjacent numbers have the same parity
        }
    }
    return true;
};

```

# Example and Explanation Walkthrough
Let's walk through the examples provided:

7. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `nums = [1]`
   - Output: `true`
   - Explanation: There is only one element, so no pairs to compare. The array is trivially special.

8. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `nums = [2, 1, 4]`
   - Output: `true`
   - Explanation:
     - Pair (2, 1): 2 is even, 1 is odd → different parity.
     - Pair (1, 4): 1 is odd, 4 is even → different parity.
     - All pairs satisfy the condition, so the array is special.

9. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `nums = [4, 3, 1, 6]`
   - Output: `false`
   - Explanation:
     - Pair (4, 3): 4 is even, 3 is odd → different parity.
     - Pair (3, 1): 3 is odd, 1 is odd → same parity.
     - The second pair fails the condition, so the array is not special.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether the array is special by checking the parity of each adjacent pair in a single pass through the array.
