[2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-intervals-into-minimum-number-of-groups/)

# Problem Intuition:

The problem asks to group intervals such that no two intervals in the same group overlap. The goal is to find the **minimum number of groups** required. If intervals intersect (overlap), they must be placed in separate groups. This is similar to finding how many intervals overlap at any point in time, which will determine how many groups we need.

### Key Observations:

- Intervals are defined by their start (`left`) and end (`right`).
- Two intervals overlap if one starts before the other ends, and they have some common values.
- To minimize the number of groups, we need to figure out how many intervals overlap at the same time. The maximum number of overlapping intervals at any point will give us the minimum number of groups required.

# Approach:

1. **Event-based Sweep Line Algorithm**:
   - **Convert Intervals to Events**: Treat the problem as events occurring on a number line:
     - Each interval `[leftᵢ, rightᵢ]` generates two events:
       - `+1` at `leftᵢ` (an interval starts),
       - `-1` at `rightᵢ + 1` (the interval ends after `rightᵢ`).
   - **Process Events**: Sort these events by time and process them in increasing order. For each event:
     - Add `+1` when an interval starts.
     - Subtract `-1` when an interval ends.
   - Keep track of the current number of overlapping intervals and update the maximum count of overlaps, which will be the answer.

2. **Explanation of Events**:
   - By tracking when intervals start and end, you can effectively determine how many intervals are active at any given point in time. The peak of this "active interval count" will give the minimum number of groups required.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Sorting the events takes **O(n log n)**, where *n* is the number of intervals.
  - Processing the events takes *O(n)*.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is ***O(n log n)***.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - We store the events, which takes ***O(n)*** space.

# Code:

```typescript
function minGroups(intervals: number[][]): number {
    const events: [number, number][] = [];

    for (const [start, end] of intervals) {
        events.push([start, 1]);
        events.push([end + 1, -1]);
    }

    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[1] - b[1]);

    let maxGroups = 0;
    let currentGroups = 0;

    for (const [time, change] of events) {
        currentGroups += change;
        maxGroups = Math.max(maxGroups, currentGroups);
    }

    return maxGroups;
};

```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]`

1. Generate events:
   ```
   (1, 1), (5, 1), (10, -1)
   (6, 1), (8, -1)
   (1, 1), (5, -1)
   (2, 1), (3, -1)
   ```
2. Sort the events:
   ```
   (1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, -1), (5, 1), (5, -1), (6, 1), (8, -1), (10, -1)
   ```
3. Process events:
   - At time `1`, `currentGroups = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - At time `2`, `currentGroups = 2 + 1 = 3` (maximum so far).
   - At time `3`, `currentGroups = 3 - 1 = 2`.
   - At time `5`, `currentGroups = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`.
   - At time `6`, `currentGroups = 2 + 1 = 3` (tie for maximum).
   - At time `8`, `currentGroups = 3 - 1 = 2`.
   - At time `10`, `currentGroups = 2 - 1 = 1`.

   **Output**: `3` (three groups are needed).

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]`

1. Generate events:
   ```
   (1, 1), (3, -1)
   (5, 1), (6, -1)
   (8, 1), (10, -1)
   (11, 1), (13, -1)
   ```
2. Sort the events:
   ```
   (1, 1), (3, -1), (5, 1), (6, -1), (8, 1), (10, -1), (11, 1), (13, -1)
   ```
3. Process events:
   - At time `1`, `currentGroups = 1`.
   - At time `3`, `currentGroups = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - At time `5`, `currentGroups = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - At time `6`, `currentGroups = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - At time `8`, `currentGroups = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - At time `10`, `currentGroups = 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - At time `11`, `currentGroups = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - At time `13`, `currentGroups = 1 - 1 = 0`.

   **Output**: `1` (all intervals can fit in one group since there are no overlaps).

### Explanation:

- The key insight is that by tracking the points at which intervals start and stop using events, we can count how many intervals are active at any given point. The maximum number of simultaneously active intervals (or overlap) gives us the number of groups required.
