[506. Relative Ranks](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/)

# Intuition
To determine the rank of each athlete based on their scores, we can first create a mapping of each score to its original index in the input array. Then, we sort the scores in descending order to simulate the placement of athletes from highest to lowest score. While traversing the sorted scores, we assign ranks accordingly based on their positions.

# Approach
1. Create a mapping of each score to its original index in the input array.
2. Sort the scores in descending order.
3. Create an array `answer` to store the ranks of each athlete.
4. Traverse the sorted scores:
   - If the position is 0 (indicating the highest score), assign "Gold Medal" to the athlete's rank.
   - If the position is 1 (indicating the second highest score), assign "Silver Medal" to the athlete's rank.
   - If the position is 2 (indicating the third highest score), assign "Bronze Medal" to the athlete's rank.
   - For other positions, assign the position number plus 1 as the athlete's rank.
5. Return the `answer` array.

# Explanation of the solution
We create a mapping of each score to its original index in the input array and then sort the scores in descending order. We assign ranks to athletes based on their positions in the sorted scores array, considering special ranks for the top three athletes. Finally, we return the `answer` array containing the ranks of each athlete.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n \log n)***, where `n` is the number of athletes.
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code

```typescript
function findRelativeRanks(score: number[]): string[] {
    const n = score.length;
    const indexMap = new Map<number, number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        indexMap.set(score[i], i);
    }

    score.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    const answer: string[] = new Array(n);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const position = i + 1;
        const originalIndex = indexMap.get(score[i])!;

        if (position === 1) {
            answer[originalIndex] = "Gold Medal";
        } else if (position === 2) {
            answer[originalIndex] = "Silver Medal";
        } else if (position === 3) {
            answer[originalIndex] = "Bronze Medal";
        } else {
            answer[originalIndex] = String(position);
        }
    }

    return answer;
};
