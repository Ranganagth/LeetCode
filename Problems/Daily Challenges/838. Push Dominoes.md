[838. Push Dominoes](https://leetcode.com/problems/push-dominoes/)

# Intuition

Each domino can be affected by a force from the left (`L`) or the right (`R`). The idea is to simulate these forces numerically:

* A domino pushed to the right (`R`) propagates a positive force to the right.
* A domino pushed to the left (`L`) propagates a negative force to the left.
* Dominoes with no initial push (`.`) will receive the strongest force acting on them (if any).

A domino affected equally from both sides stays upright.

# Approach

1. Simulate the forces from **left to right**:

   * Every `R` starts pushing with a large positive value.
   * The force decreases by 1 at each step.
   * Reset to 0 on encountering an `L`.

2. Simulate the forces from **right to left**:

   * Every `L` starts pushing with a large negative value.
   * The force increases by 1 at each step (towards zero).
   * Reset to 0 on encountering an `R`.

3. For each position:

   * If the net force is 0 → the domino stays (`.`)
   * If the net force is positive → domino falls right (`R`)
   * If the net force is negative → domino falls left (`L`)

# Complexity Analysis

* **Time**: `O(n)` – two linear scans over the domino string.
* **Space**: `O(n)` – to store force values.

# Code

```ts
function pushDominoes(dominoes: string): string {
  const n = dominoes.length;
  const forces = new Array<number>(n).fill(0);

  // Left to right: positive force for 'R'
  let force = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (dominoes[i] === 'R') {
      force = n;
    } else if (dominoes[i] === 'L') {
      force = 0;
    } else {
      force = Math.max(force - 1, 0);
    }
    forces[i] += force;
  }

  // Right to left: negative force for 'L'
  force = 0;
  for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (dominoes[i] === 'L') {
      force = n;
    } else if (dominoes[i] === 'R') {
      force = 0;
    } else {
      force = Math.max(force - 1, 0);
    }
    forces[i] -= force;
  }

  // Build the result based on net forces
  let result = '';
  for (let f of forces) {
    if (f > 0) result += 'R';
    else if (f < 0) result += 'L';
    else result += '.';
  }

  return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input**: `".L.R...LR..L.."`
**Steps**:

* Force from left to right → accumulate `R` pushes.
* Force from right to left → accumulate `L` pushes.
* Combine forces and determine final state:

**Output**: `"LL.RR.LLRRLL.."`

### **Summary**

This two-pass simulation efficiently computes the final states of dominoes under opposing forces. The idea of modeling force propagation numerically is both elegant and scalable to large inputs.
