[1550. Three Consecutive Odds](https://leetcode.com/problems/three-consecutive-odds/)

# Intuition
The problem requires us to check if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. The key observation is that we only need to count consecutive odd numbers and reset the count if we encounter an even number. If the count reaches three, we know there are three consecutive odd numbers.

# Approach
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of consecutive odd numbers.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current number is odd, increment the counter.
   - If the current number is even, reset the counter to zero.
   - If the counter reaches three, return `true`.
3. If the loop completes without the counter reaching three, return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the array since we are iterating through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using only a few variables to keep track of our state.

# Code
```typescript
function threeConsecutiveOdds(arr: number[]): boolean {
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let num of arr) {
        if (num % 2 !== 0) {
            count++;
            if (count === 3) {
                return true;
            }
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
};

```

### Explanation of Example Outputs
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `[2, 6, 4, 1]`
   - Output: `false`
   - Explanation: There are no three consecutive odd numbers in the array.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `[1, 2, 34, 3, 4, 5, 7, 23, 12]`
   - Output: `true`
   - Explanation: The subarray `[5, 7, 23]` contains three consecutive odd numbers.
