[857. Minimum Cost to Hire K Workers](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-hire-k-workers/)

# Intuition

To minimize the total wage, we need to find the lowest possible ratio of wage to quality for each worker. Then, we choose the `k` workers with the lowest ratio. To do this, we can sort the workers by their wage/quality ratio and use a sliding window of size `k` to find the minimum total wage.

# Approach

1. Create an array `workers` to store objects representing each worker, containing their quality and the wage/quality ratio.
2. Sort the `workers` array based on the wage/quality ratio.
3. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the `k` workers with the lowest quality.
4. Initialize `totalQuality` to 0. Iterate through the sorted `workers` array:
   - Add the worker's quality to `totalQuality`.
   - If the size of the priority queue exceeds `k`, remove the worker with the highest quality from the queue.
   - Calculate the total wage based on the current worker's wage/quality ratio and the total quality so far.
5. Return the minimum total wage.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: ***O(n \log n + n \log k)***
- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code

```typescript
class Worker {
    constructor(public quality: number, public ratio: number) {}
}

function mincostToHireWorkers(quality: number[], wage: number[], k: number): number {
    const n = quality.length;
    const workers: Worker[] = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        workers.push(new Worker(quality[i], wage[i] / quality[i]));
    }
    
    workers.sort((a, b) => a.ratio - b.ratio);
    
    let totalQuality = 0;
    let minCost = Infinity;
    const maxHeap: number[] = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const worker = workers[i];
        totalQuality += worker.quality;
        maxHeap.push(-worker.quality);
        maxHeap.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        
        if (maxHeap.length > k) {
            totalQuality += maxHeap.shift()!;
        }
        
        if (maxHeap.length === k) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, totalQuality * worker.ratio);
        }
    }
    
    return minCost;
};
