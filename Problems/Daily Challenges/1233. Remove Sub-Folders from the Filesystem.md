[1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-sub-folders-from-the-filesystem/)

# Intuition
The problem requires filtering out sub-folders from a list of folder paths. Each sub-folder in the list is a descendant of another folder path. By removing paths that are descendants of other folders, we only retain "root" folders (those without any other folder in the list as their parent).

# Approach
1. **Sort the Folder Paths**:
   - Sort the list of folder paths lexicographically (alphabetically). This way, if a folder is a parent of another, it will appear before its sub-folders in the list.
  
2. **Iterate Through Sorted Folders**:
   - Use a loop to compare each folder with the last one added to the result list.
   - If the current folder starts with the previous folder in the result list, followed by "/", it is a sub-folder and should be skipped.
   - Otherwise, add it to the result list as itâ€™s not a sub-folder.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The result list will now contain only the folders without any of their sub-folders.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n * log n)***, due to sorting the list of folders where *n* is the number of folders.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the result.

# Code:

```typescript
function removeSubfolders(folder: string[]): string[] {
    folder.sort();
    
    const result: string[] = [];
    
    for (const currentFolder of folder) {
        if (result.length === 0 || !currentFolder.startsWith(result[result.length - 1] + "/")) {
            result.push(currentFolder);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};

```

## Example usage

```typescript
const folder1 = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"];
console.log(removeSubfolders(folder1)); // Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]

const folder2 = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"];
console.log(removeSubfolders(folder2)); // Output: ["/a"]

const folder3 = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"];
console.log(removeSubfolders(folder3)); // Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
```

### Explanation and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1
**Input**: `folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`
1. After sorting: `["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]`
2. We iterate through the sorted folders:
   - `"/a"`: No previous folder in the result, so add `"/a"` to result.
   - `"/a/b"`: Starts with `"/a/"`, so skip.
   - `"/c/d"`: Not a sub-folder of any in result, so add `"/c/d"`.
   - `"/c/d/e"`: Starts with `"/c/d/"`, so skip.
   - `"/c/f"`: Not a sub-folder of any in result, so add `"/c/f"`.
3. **Output**: `["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]`

#### Example 2
**Input**: `folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]`
1. Sorted: `["/a", "/a/b/c", "/a/b/d"]`
2. Iteration:
   - `"/a"`: Add `"/a"` to result.
   - `"/a/b/c"`: Starts with `"/a/"`, so skip.
   - `"/a/b/d"`: Starts with `"/a/"`, so skip.
3. **Output**: `["/a"]`

#### Example 3
**Input**: `folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]`
1. Sorted: `["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]`
2. Iteration:
   - `"/a/b/c"`: Add `"/a/b/c"` to result.
   - `"/a/b/ca"`: Not a sub-folder of `"/a/b/c"`, so add `"/a/b/ca"`.
   - `"/a/b/d"`: Not a sub-folder of any in result, so add `"/a/b/d"`.
3. **Output**: `["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]`

This approach efficiently removes sub-folders by leveraging sorted folder paths and is simple to implement.
