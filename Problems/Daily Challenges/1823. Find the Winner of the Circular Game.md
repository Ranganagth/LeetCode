[1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-winner-of-the-circular-game/)

# Intuition

The problem you're describing is a variation of the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem involves a group of people standing in a circle, and every *k*-th person is eliminated until only one person remains. The problem can be solved using a recurrence relation that calculates the position of the last remaining person.

# Approach

1. **Base Case**: When there's only one person, the survivor is obviously the first person.
2. **Recursive Relation**: For more than one person, the position of the survivor can be derived from the position of the survivor in a smaller circle (one less person):
   - If we know the position of the winner in a smaller circle with *n-1* people, the position in the circle with *n* people can be found using the relation: 
     *J(n, k) = (J(n-1, k) + k) % n*
3. **Convert Indexing**: The above relation works with zero-based indexing, so the result needs to be converted to one-based indexing.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** — The function iterates over each number of people from 2 to *n*.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** — The function uses a constant amount of space.

# Code
```typescript
function findTheWinner(n: number, k: number): number {
    let winner = 0;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        winner = (winner + k) % i;
    }
    
    return winner + 1;
};

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: Start with `winner = 0`, which corresponds to the one-person case (base case).
2. **Iteration**: For each number of people from 2 to *n*, update the winner's position using the recurrence relation.
3. **Conversion**: Finally, convert the result from zero-based indexing to one-based indexing by adding 1.
