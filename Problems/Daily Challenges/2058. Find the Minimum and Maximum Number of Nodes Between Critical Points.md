[2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-and-maximum-number-of-nodes-between-critical-points/)

# Intuition

The problem requires us to find the critical points in a linked list and then calculate the minimum and maximum distances between any two critical points. Critical points are nodes that are either local maxima or local minima. To identify critical points, each node needs to have both a previous and a next node, allowing us to compare values.

# Approach

1. **Traversal and Identification of Critical Points**:
   - Traverse the linked list while keeping track of the index of each node.
   - Identify critical points by comparing each node's value with its previous and next nodes.
   - Store the indices of these critical points in an array.

2. **Calculate Distances**:
   - If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the minimum and maximum distances between any two critical points using the stored indices.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the linked list to identify and collect critical points.
2. Compute the minimum and maximum distances between the collected critical points.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)*** where *n* is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** additional space, not counting the space needed for the input and output.

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(head: ListNode | null): number[] {
    if (!head || !head.next || !head.next.next) return [-1, -1];

    let prev = head;
    let curr = head.next;
    let next = curr.next;
    let index = 1;
    let criticalPoints: number[] = [];

    while (next) {
        if ((curr.val > prev.val && curr.val > next.val) || (curr.val < prev.val && curr.val < next.val)) {
            criticalPoints.push(index);
        }
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        next = next.next;
        index++;
    }

    if (criticalPoints.length < 2) return [-1, -1];

    let minDistance = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let maxDistance = criticalPoints[criticalPoints.length - 1] - criticalPoints[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < criticalPoints.length; i++) {
        minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, criticalPoints[i] - criticalPoints[i - 1]);
    }

    return [minDistance, maxDistance];
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize pointers to traverse the list and an array to store the indices of critical points.
2. **Traversal and Identification**: As we traverse the list, we identify nodes that are local maxima or minima and store their indices.
3. **Distance Calculation**: We calculate the minimum and maximum distances between the stored indices of critical points.
4. **Return Result**: If fewer than two critical points are found, return `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, return the calculated distances.
