[1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/)

# Intuition
A star graph is characterized by having a central node connected to all other nodes. In a star graph with *n* nodes, there are *n-1* edges, and the central node will be the one appearing in all of these edges.

# Approach
1. **Identify the Center**: 
   - Since the center node is connected to every other node, it will appear in every edge.
   - By checking the first two edges, we can determine the center since the center node must appear in both these edges.
   - If the first node of the first edge is equal to the first or second node of the second edge, it is the center. Otherwise, the second node of the first edge is the center.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)***, since we only need to check the first two edges.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

# Code

```typescript
function findCenter(edges: number[][]): number {
    const [u1, v1] = edges[0];
    const [u2, v2] = edges[1];

    if (u1 === u2 || u1 === v2) {
        return u1;
    } else {
        return v1;
    }
};

```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Extract Nodes**:
   - Extract the nodes from the first two edges into variables *u1, v1* and *u2, v2*.
2. **Compare Nodes**:
   - If *u1* is equal to either *u2* or *v2*, *u1* is the center.
   - Otherwise, *v1* is the center.
