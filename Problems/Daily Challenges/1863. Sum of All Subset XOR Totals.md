[1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-all-subset-xor-totals/)

# Intuition
The idea is to explore all possible subsets of `nums` and compute the XOR for each subset. To avoid redundancy and ensure all subsets are covered, we can use a backtracking approach:

1. **Recursive Backtracking**: For each element in `nums`, decide whether to include it in the current subset or not, and recursively proceed to the next element.
2. **XOR Calculation**: Maintain a running XOR for the current subset and add this to the total sum whenever a subset is fully considered.
3. **Base Case**: When all elements have been considered, add the current XOR total to the overall sum.

# Approach
1. Initialize a recursive function that takes the current index in the array, the current XOR total, and accumulates the sum of XOR totals for all subsets.
2. For each element, decide to either include it in the current subset (by XORing it with the current XOR total) or exclude it.
3. Recursively call the function for the next element in both cases.
4. Sum up all the results from the recursive calls.

# Explanation
1. **Recursive Function `calculateXORSums`**: 
   - Takes `index` to track the current element in the array and `currentXOR` to track the XOR of the current subset.
   - If `index` equals the length of `nums`, it returns the `currentXOR` since we have considered all elements.
   - Otherwise, it recursively computes the sum of XOR totals by either including or excluding the current element.
2. **Initial Call**: The recursion starts from the 0th index with an initial XOR of 0.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(2ⁿ)***, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element can either be included or excluded, leading to `2ⁿ` subsets.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)*** for the recursion stack, where `n` is the length of the array.

# Code

```typescript
function subsetXORSum(nums: number[]): number {
    const calculateXORSums = (index: number, currentXOR: number): number => {
        if (index === nums.length) {
            return currentXOR;
        }
        
        const includeCurrent = calculateXORSums(index + 1, currentXOR ^ nums[index]);
        const excludeCurrent = calculateXORSums(index + 1, currentXOR);
        
        return includeCurrent + excludeCurrent;
    };

    return calculateXORSums(0, 0);
};
