[1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/)

# Intuition

We want to make sure **no two consecutive balloons have the same color**.
If two consecutive balloons have the same color — one of them must be removed.

However, removing a balloon costs `neededTime[i]` seconds, so to **minimize total time**,
for each group of consecutive same-colored balloons, we should **keep the one that takes the most time to remove**, and remove all the others.

In short:

> For every group of same-colored consecutive balloons, remove all except the one with the **maximum needed time** in that group.

---

# Approach

1. Initialize `totalTime = 0`.
2. Traverse the string `colors` from left to right.
3. For every group of consecutive same-colored balloons:

   * Track the **sum** of all removal times in the group.
   * Track the **maximum** removal time in that group.
   * Add `(sum - max)` to `totalTime` → this represents removing all except the one with the largest removal time.
4. Continue until the end of the string.

### Example Idea

For `colors = "aabaa"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]`
We have groups:

* `"aa"` → remove one with lower time (1)
* `"aa"` again at the end → remove one with lower time (1)
  Total = `1 + 1 = 2`

# Complexity

| Aspect | Complexity                  |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| Time   | O(n) — single traversal     |
| Space  | O(1) — constant extra space |

---

# Code

```typescript
function minCost(colors: string, neededTime: number[]): number {
    let totalTime = 0;
    let i = 0;
    const n = colors.length;

    while (i < n) {
        let j = i;
        let sum = 0;
        let maxTime = 0;

        // Process a group of consecutive same-colored balloons
        while (j < n && colors[j] === colors[i]) {
            sum += neededTime[j];
            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, neededTime[j]);
            j++;
        }

        // Add cost to remove all except the one with max removal time
        totalTime += sum - maxTime;

        // Move to the next group
        i = j;
    }

    return totalTime;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example 1

```
colors = "abaac"
neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

* Group 1: `"a"` → nothing to remove
* Group 2: `"b"` → nothing to remove
* Group 3: `"aa"` → sum = 3 + 4 = 7, max = 4
  → remove one (7 - 4 = 3)
* Group 4: `"c"` → nothing to remove

**Total time = 3**


### Example 2

```
colors = "abc"
neededTime = [1,2,3]
```

No consecutive same colors → **Total = 0**


### Example 3

```
colors = "aabaa"
neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]
```

Groups:

1. `"aa"` → sum = 1 + 2 = 3, max = 2 → remove = 1
2. `"b"` → skip
3. `"aa"` → sum = 4 + 1 = 5, max = 4 → remove = 1

**Total = 1 + 1 = 2**

---

### Final Answer

* **Intuition:** Remove all duplicates in each group except the one with max removal cost.
* **Approach:** Group-based scanning (sum - max).
* **Time:** O(n)
* **Space:** O(1)
* **Result Example:**
  `"abaac"` → 3
  `"abc"` → 0
  `"aabaa"` → 2
