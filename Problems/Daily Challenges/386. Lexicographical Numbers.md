[386. Lexicographical Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographical-numbers/)

# Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return the list of numbers from `1` to `n`, **sorted in lexicographical (dictionary) order**.
**Constraints:**
* Time complexity must be **O(n)**
* Space complexity must be **O(1)** extra space (excluding output)
* `1 <= n <= 50,000`

# Intuition

Lexicographical order mimics how words are sorted in a dictionary. For numbers:

* `1, 10, 11, ..., 19, 2, 20, ...` comes before `3, 30, ...`
* This suggests a **tree-like structure**, where each number can generate the next level by appending digits 0–9:

Example:

```
       1
     / | \
   10 11 12 ...
       2
     / | \
   20 21 22 ...
```

A **depth-first traversal (DFS)** starting from 1 to 9 allows us to generate the numbers in lexicographical order.

# Approach

1. Start with `curr = 1`.
2. At each step:

   * Append `curr` to the result.
   * Try to go deeper by multiplying `curr * 10` (e.g., `1 → 10`).
   * If that's not possible (exceeds `n`), increment `curr`.
   * If increment leads to a number ending in `9` or going beyond the current prefix level, move up in the tree using integer division by 10 until valid.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**
	* **O(n)**: We visit each number exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**
	* **O(1)** extra space (excluding result list).

# Code

```typescript
function lexicalOrder(n: number): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];

    let curr = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result.push(curr);

        if (curr * 10 <= n) {
            curr *= 10; // go deeper
        } else {
            while (curr % 10 === 9 || curr + 1 > n) {
                curr = Math.floor(curr / 10); // backtrack
            }
            curr++; // move to next sibling
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Input: `n = 13`

```
Start with curr = 1
Push: 1 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13
Backtrack and go to: 2 → 3 → 4 → ... → 9
```

**Output:** `[1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`

#### Input: `n = 2`

```
Start with curr = 1 → push 1
Next: 2 → push 2
```

**Output:** `[1,2]`

---

### **Summary**

* The key to the solution is simulating a **pre-order DFS traversal** on a tree where each node has children formed by appending digits 0–9.
* This allows us to generate lexicographical order **in-place** with constant extra space.
