[1219. Path with Maximum Gold](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-maximum-gold/)

# Intuition
To find the maximum amount of gold that can be collected, we can perform a depth-first search (DFS) starting from each cell containing gold. At each step of the DFS, we explore the neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) and recursively visit each neighbor if it contains gold.

# Approach
1. Iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. For each cell containing gold, start a DFS from that cell to explore all possible paths.
3. During the DFS, keep track of the current amount of gold collected.
4. Explore all neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right) and recursively visit each neighbor if it contains gold.
5. Update the maximum amount of gold collected at the end of each path.
6. Return the maximum amount of gold collected.

# Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: ***O(4^mn)***, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. This is because for each cell containing gold, we perform a DFS which can explore up to ***4^(mn)*** paths in the worst case.
- Space complexity: ***O(mn)*** for the recursive call stack.

# Code
```typescript
function getMaximumGold(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    let maxGold = 0;
    
    function dfs(row: number, col: number, currentGold: number): void {
        if (row < 0 || row >= m || col < 0 || col >= n || grid[row][col] === 0) return;
        
        const goldInCurrentCell = grid[row][col];
        currentGold += goldInCurrentCell;
        
        grid[row][col] = 0;
        
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, currentGold);
        
        dfs(row + 1, col, currentGold); 
        dfs(row - 1, col, currentGold); 
        dfs(row, col + 1, currentGold); 
        dfs(row, col - 1, currentGold); 
        
        grid[row][col] = goldInCurrentCell;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] !== 0) {
                dfs(i, j, 0);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxGold;
};

```
