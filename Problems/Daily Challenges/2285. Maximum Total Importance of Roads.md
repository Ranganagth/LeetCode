[2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads/)

# Intuition

To maximize the total importance:
1. **Count the Degrees**: Calculate the degree (number of connected roads) for each city.
2. **Assign Values**: Assign the highest values to the cities with the highest degrees. This ensures that the roads connected to these cities contribute the maximum possible importance.

# Approach

1. **Degree Calculation**: Create an array to store the degree of each city. Iterate over the list of roads to populate this array.
2. **Sort by Degree**: Sort the cities based on their degrees in descending order.
3. **Value Assignment**: Assign values from `n` to `1` based on the sorted order of cities by their degrees.
4. **Calculate Total Importance**: Calculate the total importance by summing up the importance of each road using the assigned values.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n + m log n)***, where *n* is the number of cities and *m* is the number of roads. The sorting step dominates the time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for storing the degrees and the sorted list of cities.

# Code

```typescript
function maximumImportance(n: number, roads: number[][]): number {
    const degrees = Array(n).fill(0);

    for (const [a, b] of roads) {
        degrees[a]++;
        degrees[b]++;
    }

    const cities = degrees.map((degree, city) => [city, degree]);

    cities.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);

    const values = Array(n).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        values[cities[i][0]] = n - i;
    }

    let totalImportance = 0;
    for (const [a, b] of roads) {
        totalImportance += values[a] + values[b];
    }

    return totalImportance;
};

```

### Explanation

- **Degree Calculation**: The `degrees` array stores how many roads are connected to each city.
- **Sorting**: Cities are sorted by their degrees in descending order, ensuring that cities with more connections get higher values.
- **Value Assignment**: Values from `n` to `1` are assigned to the cities based on their sorted order.
- **Total Importance Calculation**: The total importance is calculated by summing the importance of each road using the assigned values.
