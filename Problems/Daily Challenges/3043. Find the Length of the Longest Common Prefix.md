[3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-length-of-the-longest-common-prefix/)

# Intuition

In the initial approach, the solution involved comparing all pairs from `arr1` and `arr2`, which led to an excessive number of operations, causing a time limit exceeded error. The better approach leverages **caching** and **prefix decomposition** to reduce redundant computations.

- By breaking each number down into its possible prefixes (progressively removing the last digit), we can store those prefixes in a cache (set).
- Then, for each number in `arr2`, we try to match it with the stored prefixes from `arr1`. If a match is found, the length of that prefix is tracked as the maximum result.

# Optimized Approach

1. **Cache Prefixes**:
    - For each number in `arr1`, generate all its prefixes by successively removing the last digit (e.g., for `123`, prefixes are `123`, `12`, `1`). Store these in a set for fast lookup.

2. **Match Against `arr2`**:
    - For each number in `arr2`, try to match it (or its prefixes) against the cache. Start with the full number and progressively remove the last digit until a match is found or no prefix remains.

3. **Max Length**:
    - Track the maximum length of the matched prefix and return it as the result.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O((n + m) * k)***, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2`, and `k` is the average number of digits in the numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n * k)*** for storing the prefixes in the set.

- **Prefix Generation for `arr1`**: For each number, we generate all its prefixes. In the worst case, this is proportional to the number of digits. So, for `n` numbers in `arr1`, this operation takes `O(n * k)` where `k` is the average number of digits.
  
- **Prefix Matching for `arr2`**: For each number in `arr2`, we check its prefixes against the set. Since checking in a set is `O(1)`, this takes `O(m * k)` for `m` numbers in `arr2`.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O((n + m) * k)`.
# Code:

```typescript
function longestCommonPrefix(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number {
    const cache = new Set<number>();  // To store all prefixes from arr1
    let result = 0;  // Track the length of the longest common prefix

    // Step 1: Store all possible prefixes of numbers in arr1
    for (let num of arr1) {
        while (num > 0) {
            cache.add(num);  // Add current number as prefix
            num = Math.floor(num / 10);  // Remove the last digit
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Check for longest common prefix with numbers in arr2
    for (let num of arr2) {
        let currentLen = `${num}`.length;  // Get the length of the current number
        
        // Check the number and its prefixes for a match in the cache
        while (num > 0 && currentLen > result) {
            if (cache.has(num)) {  // If there's a match, update the result
                result = currentLen;
            }
            num = Math.floor(num / 10);  // Remove the last digit
            currentLen -= 1;  // Decrease the length of the prefix
        }
    }

    return result;  // Return the longest common prefix length
};

```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Cache Setup**:
    - We loop through all numbers in `arr1` and progressively add each prefix of these numbers to a set (`cache`).

2. **Prefix Matching**:
    - For each number in `arr2`, we check whether the number or any of its prefixes are present in the `cache`. If a match is found, we update the result with the length of the matched prefix.

3. **Return the Maximum**:
    - Once all comparisons are complete, we return the maximum length of the common prefix found.

### Example Walkthrough

**Example 1:**

Input: `arr1 = [1, 10, 100], arr2 = [1000]`

- **Step 1 (Cache Prefixes from `arr1`)**:
    - From `1`, we add: `1` to the cache.
    - From `10`, we add: `10`, `1` (already present).
    - From `100`, we add: `100`, `10`, `1` (both already present).

- **Step 2 (Check Prefixes from `arr2`)**:
    - `1000`: Check `1000`, then `100`, which is in the cache. The longest common prefix is `100` (length = 3).

Output: `3`

**Example 2:**

Input: `arr1 = [1, 2, 3], arr2 = [4, 4, 4]`

- **Step 1 (Cache Prefixes from `arr1`)**:
    - From `1`, add `1`.
    - From `2`, add `2`.
    - From `3`, add `3`.

- **Step 2 (Check Prefixes from `arr2`)**:
    - `4`: No match with any number in the cache.
    - `4`: No match.
    - `4`: No match.

Output: `0` (no common prefix exists).
