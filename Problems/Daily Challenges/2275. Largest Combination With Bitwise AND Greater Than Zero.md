[2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-combination-with-bitwise-and-greater-than-zero/)

# Intuition

The task requires finding the largest combination of elements from an array such that their bitwise AND is greater than zero. Since a bitwise AND operation between two numbers retains only bits that are set to `1` in both numbers, this means that each combination should share at least one bit position with a `1` across all numbers in the combination.

# Approach

1. **Count Bitwise Positions**:
   - For each number in the `candidates` array, examine its binary representation to count occurrences of each bit position set to `1`.
   - Keep an array `bitCount` of size 24-30 (since *10⁷* in binary has at most 24 bits) to track the count of `1`s in each position for all numbers in `candidates`.

2. **Determine Maximum Combination Size**:
   - For each bit position, `bitCount[i]` gives the number of numbers with a `1` at that bit position.
   - The largest possible combination size where the bitwise AND can be non-zero is the maximum value in the `bitCount` array, as this represents the maximum number of elements that share at least one common `1` in that position.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the maximum value from `bitCount`, as this will be the size of the largest combination where the bitwise AND of all selected numbers is greater than zero.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n × b)***, where *n* is the number of elements in `candidates` and *b* is the number of bits (approximately 24-30 for values up to **10⁷***.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(b)*** for the `bitCount` array.

# Code 

```typescript
function largestCombination(candidates: number[]): number {
    const bitCount = new Array(24).fill(0);

    for (const num of candidates) {
        for (let i = 0; i < 24; i++) {
            if ((num & (1 << i)) !== 0) {
                bitCount[i]++;
            }
        }
    }

    return Math.max(...bitCount);
}
```

### Explanation and Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1

Input:
```plaintext
candidates = [16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14]
```

1. **Bit Counting**:
   - Binary representations:
     - `16` = `10000`
     - `17` = `10001`
     - `71` = `1000111`
     - `62` = `111110`
     - `12` = `1100`
     - `24` = `11000`
     - `14` = `1110`
   - After counting, `bitCount` will capture the count of `1`s for each bit position.

2. **Determine Maximum Combination Size**:
   - Find the maximum value in `bitCount`, which is `4`, as there are four numbers with a shared `1` in some bit positions, allowing a maximum combination size of `4` with a non-zero AND.

Output:
```plaintext
4
```

#### Example 2

Input:
```plaintext
candidates = [8, 8]
```

1. **Bit Counting**:
   - Binary representation:
     - `8` = `1000`
   - Bit count for the position corresponding to `1000` in binary is `2`.

Output:
```plaintext
2
```

### Summary

The solution effectively leverages bitwise operations to determine the largest subset where a shared `1` in at least one position results in a non-zero AND operation. This efficient counting approach allows us to handle large arrays within constraints.
