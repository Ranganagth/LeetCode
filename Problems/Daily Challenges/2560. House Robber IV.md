[2560. House Robber IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iv/)

# Intuition

The robber must steal from **at least** `k` houses while ensuring that no two adjacent houses are robbed. The goal is to **minimize the maximum amount stolen from a single house** among all possible ways to rob `k` houses.

Instead of brute-force searching all subsets, **binary search** is used on the "capability" (max value among robbed houses) to efficiently find the minimum possible capability that allows stealing from `k` houses.

# Approach

1. **Binary Search on "Capability" (`x`)**
    
    - The robber's "capability" ranges from `min(nums)` to `max(nums)`.
    - We perform binary search on `x`, where `x` is the maximum value among the robbed houses.
2. **Check Function (`canRob(x)`)**
    
    - Iterate through `nums` and greedily rob houses **only if their value is ≤ `x`**, ensuring the robber skips adjacent houses.
    - Count how many houses are robbed. If **at least `k` houses** are robbed, return `true`.
3. **Binary Search Execution**
    
    - If `canRob(mid) == true`, move left (`r = mid`), searching for a lower capability.
    - Otherwise, move right (`l = mid + 1`).
    - The smallest `x` that allows robbing `k` houses is the answer.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Binary search on `x`** → O(log max(nums))
- **Check function iterates `nums`** → O(n)
- **Total Complexity** → ***O(n log max(nums))***

Efficient for `n ≤ 10⁵` and `nums[i] ≤ 10⁹`.

# Code

```typescript
function minCapability(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    let [l, r] = [Math.min(...nums), Math.max(...nums)];

    const canRob = (x: number): boolean => {
        let count = 0, prevRobbed = false;
        for (const money of nums) {
            if (money <= x && !prevRobbed) {
                count++;
                prevRobbed = true;
            } else {
                prevRobbed = false;
            }
            if (count >= k) return true;
        }
        return false;
    };

    while (l < r) {
        let mid = Math.floor((l + r) / 2);
        if (canRob(mid)) r = mid;
        else l = mid + 1;
    }
    
    return l;
};

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input**

```typescript
nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
```

#### **Binary Search Execution**

- **Check `x = 5`** → Can rob houses `[2, 5]`
- **Check `x = 4`** → Cannot rob `k` houses 

#### **Output**

```typescript
5
```

### **Example 2**

#### **Input**

```typescript
nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
```

#### **Binary Search Execution**

- **Check `x = 2`** → Can rob houses `[2, 1]` 
- **Check `x = 1`** → Cannot rob `k` houses

#### **Output**

```typescript
2
```

## **Why This Approach?**

**Efficient (O(n log max(nums)))**  
**Uses Binary Search for optimal capability**  
**Greedy selection ensures valid house selection**  
**Works well within constraints (`10⁵` houses, `10⁹` max value)**
