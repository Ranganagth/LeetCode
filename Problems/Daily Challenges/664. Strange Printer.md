[664. Strange Printer](https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer/)

# Intuition:
- The key insight is that each segment of consecutive identical characters can be printed in one turn. However, printing non-consecutive identical characters optimally requires minimizing overlapping prints.
- If we think about the problem recursively, for each substring, we want to know how many turns it takes to print it, considering that overlapping or extending prints might be beneficial in minimizing the total number of turns.

# Approach:
1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We'll create a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns needed to print the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If `i == j`, then `dp[i][j] = 1` because a single character can be printed in one turn.
   
3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each substring `s[i:j+1]`, try every possible split `k` (where `i <= k < j`) and calculate:
     - The cost to print `s[i:k]` and `s[k+1:j+1]`.
     - If `s[k]` and `s[j]` are the same, the cost might be reduced by merging these parts.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of turns over all possible splits.

4. **Final Result**:
   - The final result will be stored in `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n³)*** because we're filling an `n x n` DP table, and each cell involves an `O(n)` computation due to checking all possible splits.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n²)*** for storing the DP table.

# Code:

```typescript
function strangePrinter(s: string): number {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    for (let len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
            let j = i + len - 1;
            dp[i][j] = len;
            for (let k = i; k < j; k++) {
                let total = dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j];
                if (s[k] === s[j]) {
                    total -= 1;
                }
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], total);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n - 1];
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(strangePrinter("aaabbb")); // Output: 2
console.log(strangePrinter("aba"));    // Output: 2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - We create a 2D DP table where each entry `dp[i][j]` initially assumes the worst case (i.e., needing one turn per character in the substring).

2. **Filling DP Table**:
   - For every possible substring length from 1 to `n`, we compute the minimum turns needed by trying all possible ways to split the substring and considering possible merges.

3. **Final Answer**:
   - The result for the entire string `s` is found in `dp[0][n-1]`, which gives the minimum turns needed to print the entire string.
