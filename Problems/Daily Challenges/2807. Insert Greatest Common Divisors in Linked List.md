[2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-greatest-common-divisors-in-linked-list/)

# Intuition

The task requires inserting a new node with a value equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) between every pair of adjacent nodes in a singly linked list. For each pair of adjacent nodes, we calculate the GCD and insert a new node with the calculated value between them.

# Approach

1. **Traverse the List**: We traverse the linked list from the head node to the end. For each pair of adjacent nodes, calculate the GCD of their values.
2. **Insert New Nodes**: After calculating the GCD, we create a new node and insert it between the two adjacent nodes.
3. **Handle Edge Case**: If the list contains only one node, no insertion is needed, and we return the original list.

### Steps:

1. Start from the head of the linked list.
2. For each node, calculate the GCD of the current node's value and the next node's value.
3. Create a new node with the GCD value and insert it between the current node and the next node.
4. Continue this process until you reach the end of the list.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse the list once to calculate the GCD and insert nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, excluding the space required for the new nodes (which are part of the output).

# Code
```typescript
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

function gcd(a: number, b: number): number {
    if (b === 0) return a;
    return gcd(b, a % b);
}

function insertGreatestCommonDivisors(head: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
    if (!head || !head.next) {
        return head;
    }

    let current = head;

    while (current && current.next) {
        const currentValue = current.val;
        const nextValue = current.next.val;
        const gcdValue = gcd(currentValue, nextValue);

        const newNode = new ListNode(gcdValue);

        newNode.next = current.next;
        current.next = newNode;

        current = newNode.next;
    }

    return head;
};

```
### Explanation of the Code

1. **ListNode Class**: Defines the structure of the linked list node with two properties: `val` (the node's value) and `next` (a pointer to the next node).
    
2. **GCD Function**: A helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
    
3. **insertGreatestCommonDivisors Function**:
    
    - **Input**: The `head` of the linked list.
    - **Logic**:
        - We traverse the linked list starting from the head.
        - For each node, we calculate the GCD of the node's value and the next node's value.
        - After calculating the GCD, we create a new node with the GCD value.
        - We insert the new node between the current node and the next node by adjusting the `next` pointers.
        - We then move to the next original node (skipping the newly inserted node).
    - **Output**: The modified linked list after inserting all the new GCD nodes.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Example 1:

Input: `head = [18,6,10,3]`

1. Start from the first node `18`:
    
    - GCD of `18` and `6` = `6`.
    - Insert a new node with value `6` between `18` and `6`.
    - The list becomes: `[18, 6, 6, 10, 3]`.
2. Move to the next node `6` (skipping the newly inserted node):
    
    - GCD of `6` and `10` = `2`.
    - Insert a new node with value `2` between `6` and `10`.
    - The list becomes: `[18, 6, 6, 2, 10, 3]`.
3. Move to the next node `10`:
    
    - GCD of `10` and `3` = `1`.
    - Insert a new node with value `1` between `10` and `3`.
    - The list becomes: `[18, 6, 6, 2, 10, 1, 3]`.
4. The final list is: `[18, 6, 6, 2, 10, 1, 3]`.
    

#### Example 2:

Input: `head = [7]`

- No adjacent nodes exist, so no new nodes are inserted.
- The final list remains: `[7]`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently inserts nodes with GCD values between adjacent nodes in a linked list, maintaining an ***O(n)*** time complexity due to the single traversal of the list. It handles edge cases where the list has fewer than two nodes by returning the list as-is.
