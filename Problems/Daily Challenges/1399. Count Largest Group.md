[1399. Count Largest Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-largest-group/)

# Intuition

We're given numbers from `1` to `n` and asked to group them by the **sum of their digits**. Then, among all the groups, we want to return how many groups have the **maximum size**.

For example, the digit sum of `10` is `1` (`1 + 0`) and for `11`, it's `2` (`1 + 1`). Numbers like `1` and `10` will belong to the same group because they share the same digit sum.

# Approach

1. **Calculate digit sum**:
   - For every number `i` from `1` to `n`, calculate the sum of its digits using a helper function.
   - Maintain a **map** to count the number of elements for each digit sum.

2. **Track frequency**:
   - As we populate the map, also track the **maximum frequency** of any group.

3. **Count groups with max size**:
   - After processing all numbers, count how many groups have a size equal to the maximum frequency.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * d)` where `d` is the number of digits in `n`. Since `n` ≤ 10⁴, this is efficient.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m)` where `m` is the number of distinct digit sums. At most, the sum of digits for numbers ≤ 9999 is 36.

# Code

```ts
function countLargestGroup(n: number): number {
  const map: Record<number, number> = {};

  function digitSum(x: number): number {
    let sum = 0;
    while (x > 0) {
      sum += x % 10;
      x = Math.floor(x / 10);
    }
    return sum;
  }

  let maxSize = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    const sum = digitSum(i);
    map[sum] = (map[sum] || 0) + 1;
    maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, map[sum]);
  }

  let count = 0;
  for (const key in map) {
    if (map[key] === maxSize) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `n = 13`  
**Digit Sums**:
- 1 → 1
- 2 → 2
- 3 → 3
- 4 → 4
- 5 → 5
- 6 → 6
- 7 → 7
- 8 → 8
- 9 → 9
- 10 → 1
- 11 → 2
- 12 → 3
- 13 → 4

**Groups**:
- [1,10] → size 2
- [2,11] → size 2
- [3,12] → size 2
- [4,13] → size 2
- Others are size 1

**Output**: `4` (four groups of size 2)

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `n = 2`
- Groups: [1], [2] → both size 1

**Output**: `2`

### **Summary**

This problem demonstrates a classic case of **frequency grouping** based on a derived property (digit sum). It's solved efficiently using a hash map and a simple digit sum function.
