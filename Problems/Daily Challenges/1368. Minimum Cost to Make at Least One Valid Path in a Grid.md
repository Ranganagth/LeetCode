[1368. Minimum Cost to Make at Least One Valid Path in a Grid](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-at-least-one-valid-path-in-a-grid/)

# Intuition

The problem involves finding the minimum cost to create a valid path in a grid where each cell has a directional sign. A valid path is formed by following the directions on the grid from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`.

If the current sign doesn't lead to the desired direction, we can modify it at a cost of `1`. The goal is to minimize this cost.

This is essentially a **shortest path problem** on a weighted graph where:
- Each grid cell represents a node.
- Moving in the intended direction has no cost.
- Modifying the direction incurs a cost of `1`.

We can solve this using **Dijkstra's algorithm** or a variation of **0-1 BFS**, where:
- Nodes with a cost of `0` are processed with higher priority (similar to using a deque).

# Approach

1. **Representation**:
    - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to process grid cells.
    - Each cell is represented as `(cost, x, y)`, where `cost` is the cost incurred to reach the cell `(x, y)`.
	
2. **Directional Movement**:
    - Map the directional signs (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) to their respective movements:
        - `1`: Right `(0, 1)`
        - `2`: Left `(0, -1)`
        - `3`: Down `(1, 0)`
        - `4`: Up `(-1, 0)`
		
3. **Algorithm**:
    - Start from `(0, 0)` with a cost of `0` and push it into the priority queue.
    - For each cell, check all possible directions.
        - If moving in the current direction matches the grid's sign, the cost is `0`.
        - Otherwise, modifying the sign costs `1`.
    - Update the cost for neighboring cells if a cheaper path is found.
	
4. **Stopping Condition**:
    - Once the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)` is processed, return the cost.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(m⋅n⋅log⁡(m⋅n))*** due to priority queue operations.

- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m⋅n)*** for the visited array and queue.

# Code

```typescript
function minCost(grid: number[][]): number {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    // Directions: Right, Left, Down, Up
    const directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]];

    // Min-heap for Dijkstra's algorithm
    const heap: [number, number, number][] = []; // [cost, x, y]
    const costs = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    costs[0][0] = 0;

    heap.push([0, 0, 0]); // Start with cost = 0 at (0, 0)

    while (heap.length > 0) {
        const [currentCost, x, y] = heap.shift()!;
        
        // If at the bottom-right corner, return the cost
        if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1) return currentCost;

        for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            const [dx, dy] = directions[i];
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                const nextCost = currentCost + (grid[x][y] === i + 1 ? 0 : 1);
                if (nextCost < costs[nx][ny]) {
                    costs[nx][ny] = nextCost;
                    heap.push([nextCost, nx, ny]);
                    heap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]); // Keep the heap sorted
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return -1; // Shouldn't reach here
};

```

### **Example and Walkthrough**

#### **Example 1**

**Input**:

```typescript
const grid = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [2, 2, 2, 2],
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [2, 2, 2, 2],
];
console.log(minCost(grid)); // Output: 3
```

**Walkthrough**:

- Start at `(0, 0)`. Move along the direction of `1` (right) until `(0, 3)`.
- Modify the direction at `(0, 3)` to down (cost = 1).
- Move down to `(3, 0)` while modifying at `(1, 0)` and `(2, 0)` (total cost = 3).
- Reach `(3, 3)` with a total cost of `3`.

#### **Example 2**

**Input**:

```typescript
const grid = [
    [1, 1, 3],
    [3, 2, 2],
    [1, 1, 4],
];
console.log(minCost(grid)); // Output: 0
```

**Walkthrough**:

- The path `(0, 0) → (0, 1) → (0, 2) → (1, 2) → (2, 2)` follows the signs exactly with no modifications.

**Output**: `0`.

#### **Example 3**

**Input**:

```typescript
const grid = [
    [1, 2],
    [4, 3],
];
console.log(minCost(grid)); // Output: 1
```

**Walkthrough**:

- Modify direction at `(0, 1)` to move down (cost = 1).

**Output**: `1`.

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Cell**:
    - *grid = [[1]]*, output: `0`.
2. **Large Grid**:
    - Handles *m, n ≤ 100* efficiently due to *O(m⋅n⋅log⁡(m⋅n))* complexity.
