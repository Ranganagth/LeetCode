[38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

# Intuition

The "count-and-say" sequence is built recursively using **run-length encoding**:  
- `countAndSay(1)` = "1"  
- `countAndSay(n)` = RLE of `countAndSay(n - 1)`

Each term in the sequence describes the previous term:
- "1" → "one 1" → "11"
- "11" → "two 1s" → "21"
- "21" → "one 2, one 1" → "1211"
... and so on.

# Approach (Iterative)

1. Start with base case: `term = "1"`.
2. For `n - 1` times, generate the next term using a **run-length encoding** of the current term:
   - Initialize an empty result string.
   - Use a loop to count consecutive characters.
   - Append `<count><digit>` to the result.
3. Return the final string after `n - 1` iterations.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n * m)***, where `n` is the input and `m` is the length of the longest string generated (since each iteration scans the entire current term).
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(m)***, storing the generated string.

# Code

```ts
function countAndSay(n: number): string {
    if (n === 1) return "1";

    let term = "1";

    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        let nextTerm = "";
        let count = 1;

        for (let j = 1; j <= term.length; j++) {
            if (term[j] === term[j - 1]) {
                count++;
            } else {
                nextTerm += count.toString() + term[j - 1];
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        term = nextTerm;
    }

    return term;
};

```

### **Example and Explanation Walkthrough**

#### **Input**: `n = 4`

- **Step 1 (Base)**: `"1"`
- **Step 2**: one `1` → `"11"`
- **Step 3**: two `1s` → `"21"`
- **Step 4**: one `2`, one `1` → `"1211"`

**Output**: `"1211"`

### **Summary**

This problem is an elegant example of string processing and iterative transformation using run-length encoding. The iterative method avoids the call stack overhead of recursion and is well-suited for `n <= 30` as required by the constraints.
