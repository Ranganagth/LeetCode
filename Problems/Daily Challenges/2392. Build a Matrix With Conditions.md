[2392. Build a Matrix With Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/build-a-matrix-with-conditions/)

# Intuition

To solve this problem, we need to construct a \( k \times k \) matrix that meets the given row and column conditions. This involves using topological sorting, a technique used to order elements based on given constraints. We can break this problem down into the following steps:

1. **Topological Sorting**: We need to find a valid order of the elements based on the row and column conditions using topological sorting.
2. **Matrix Construction**: Once we have the row and column orders, we can place the elements into the matrix accordingly.

# Approach

1. **Topological Sorting**:
   - Construct a directed graph for both row and column conditions.
   - Perform topological sorting on both graphs to get a valid row order and column order.

2. **Matrix Construction**:
   - Place the elements in the matrix based on the sorted orders.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If there's a cycle in the graph (which would make topological sorting impossible), return an empty matrix.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Use adjacency lists to represent the directed graphs for row and column conditions.
   - Use arrays to keep track of in-degrees for each node.

2. **Topological Sort**:
   - Implement Kahn's algorithm to perform topological sorting:
     - Initialize a queue with all nodes having zero in-degrees.
     - Process each node, reducing the in-degree of its neighbors.
     - If a neighbor's in-degree becomes zero, add it to the queue.
     - Continue until all nodes are processed or a cycle is detected.

3. **Matrix Filling**:
   - Map each element to its position based on the topological order.
   - Fill the matrix using the row and column positions obtained.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(k + n + m)***
  - Building the graph takes ***O(n + m)***.
  - Topological sorting takes ***O(k + n + m)*** as each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(k + n + m)***
  - Storing the graph, in-degrees, and topological order arrays.

# Code 

```typescript
function buildMatrix(k: number, rowConditions: number[][], colConditions: number[][]): number[][] {
    const topoSort = (conditions: number[][]): number[] | null => {
        const graph: Map<number, number[]> = new Map();
        const inDegree: number[] = new Array(k + 1).fill(0);

        for (let [u, v] of conditions) {
            if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, []);
            graph.get(u)!.push(v);
            inDegree[v]++;
        }

        const queue: number[] = [];
        for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] === 0) queue.push(i);
        }

        const order: number[] = [];
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            order.push(node);
            if (graph.has(node)) {
                for (let neighbor of graph.get(node)!) {
                    inDegree[neighbor]--;
                    if (inDegree[neighbor] === 0) queue.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        return order.length === k ? order : null;
    };

    const rowOrder = topoSort(rowConditions);
    const colOrder = topoSort(colConditions);

    if (!rowOrder || !colOrder) return [];

    const rowPos = new Map<number, number>();
    const colPos = new Map<number, number>();

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        rowPos.set(rowOrder[i], i);
        colPos.set(colOrder[i], i);
    }

    const result = Array.from({ length: k }, () => Array(k).fill(0));
    for (let i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
        const r = rowPos.get(i)!;
        const c = colPos.get(i)!;
        result[r][c] = i;
    }

    return result;
};

```

## Example usage:
``` Typescript
console.log(buildMatrix(3, [[1,2],[3,2]], [[2,1],[3,2]]));
// Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
```

### Explanation of Examples

1. **Example 1**:
    - **Input**: `k = 3`, `rowConditions = [[1, 2], [3, 2]]`, `colConditions = [[2, 1], [3, 2]]`
    - **Output**: `[[3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`
    - **Explanation**: After topological sorting, the orders are `[3, 1, 2]` for rows and `[3, 2, 1]` for columns. Placing elements based on these orders satisfies all conditions.

2. **Example 2**:
    - **Input**: `k = 3`, `rowConditions = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [2, 3]]`, `colConditions = [[2, 1]]`
    - **Output**: `[]`
    - **Explanation**: A cycle is detected in the row conditions, making it impossible to satisfy all conditions. Hence, return an empty matrix.
