[3289. The Two Sneaky Numbers of Digitville](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-two-sneaky-numbers-of-digitville/)

# Intuition

We have an array `nums` that should ideally contain all integers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.
However, two numbers appear **twice**.

So, there are `n + 2` elements in the array, and we need to find those two repeated numbers.

This is a classic **frequency detection** problem — we just need to know which numbers occur twice.

# Approach 1 (Using Frequency Counting - Simple & Efficient)

### Steps

1. Create a frequency map (or array) to count how many times each number appears.
2. Traverse `nums`, increment the count for each number.
3. If any number’s count becomes `2`, add it to the result array.
4. Return the result once we find two such numbers.

### Why this works

* Since all numbers are in the range `[0, n-1]`, we can directly index them.
* We only need one pass to count and one pass to collect.

---

## Approach 2 (Using a Set - More concise)

1. Create an empty set `seen` and an empty array `duplicates`.
2. For each number in `nums`:

   * If it’s already in `seen`, add it to `duplicates`.
   * Otherwise, add it to `seen`.
3. Return `duplicates`.

This avoids explicit counting and uses a hash structure for O(1) lookups.

# Complexity Analysis

| Aspect | Complexity                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(n)                              |
| Space  | O(n) (for set or frequency array) |

Efficient for `n ≤ 100`.

# Code(Using Set)

```typescript
function findDuplicates(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const seen = new Set<number>();
    const duplicates: number[] = [];

    for (const num of nums) {
        if (seen.has(num)) {
            duplicates.push(num);
        } else {
            seen.add(num);
        }
        if (duplicates.length === 2) break; // early stop if both found
    }

    return duplicates;
};

```

## Example Walkthrough

### Example:

```
nums = [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]
```

**Step-by-step:**

* seen = {}, duplicates = []
* num = 7 → add to seen
* num = 1 → add to seen
* num = 5 → add to seen
* num = 4 → add to seen
* num = 3 → add to seen
* num = 4 → already in seen → duplicates = [4]
* num = 6 → add to seen
* num = 0 → add to seen
* num = 9 → add to seen
* num = 5 → already in seen → duplicates = [4,5]

**Result:** `[4,5]`

## Alternative (Frequency Array Version)

```typescript
function getSneakyNumbers(nums: number[]): number[] {
    const n = nums.length - 2;
    const freq = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const res: number[] = [];

    for (const num of nums) {
        freq[num]++;
        if (freq[num] === 2) res.push(num);
        if (res.length === 2) break;
    }

    return res;
}
```

---

**Final Answer:**

* Intuition: Find numbers that appear twice.
* Approach: Use a Set or frequency count.
* Time: O(n), Space: O(n).
* Example: `[7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2] → [4,5]`.
