[1106. Parsing A Boolean Expression](https://leetcode.com/problems/parsing-a-boolean-expression/)

### Problem Understanding:

The task is to evaluate a Boolean expression represented as a string. The expression can consist of logical operators:
- `t` (true),
- `f` (false),
- `!(expr)` for NOT,
- `&(expr₁, expr₂, ..., exprₙ)` for AND,
- `|(expr₁, expr₂, ..., exprₙ)` for OR.

The challenge is to correctly parse the string, handle the nested operations, and compute the final result by evaluating each sub-expression.

# Intuition:

1. **Recursive Nature**: The expression can be naturally broken into smaller sub-expressions that are evaluated independently. Since the operations can be nested, a **recursive** or **stack-based** approach is ideal.

2. **Key Operations**:
   - **NOT (`!`)** negates a single sub-expression.
   - **AND (`&`)** evaluates to `true` only if all sub-expressions are `true`.
   - **OR (`|`)** evaluates to `true` if at least one sub-expression is `true`.

3. **Parsing**: The string needs to be parsed character by character:
   - When encountering an opening bracket (`(`), a new sub-expression begins.
   - When encountering a closing bracket (`)`), the corresponding sub-expression needs to be evaluated.
   - A stack is helpful to manage nested sub-expressions, where each level of nesting is pushed onto the stack and evaluated when complete.

4. **Stack Approach**: Use a stack to keep track of the current operator (`&`, `|`, or `!`) and the corresponding sub-expressions. When we hit a closing parenthesis, we pop the expressions from the stack and evaluate them.

# Approach:

1. **Initialize a stack**: The stack will store the current operator and the sub-expressions to evaluate.
   
2. **Iterate over the expression**: Process each character:
   - For `t` or `f`: Add it to the current list of sub-expressions.
   - For `&`, `|`, or `!`: Start a new sub-expression by pushing the operator onto the stack.
   - For `(`: Just continue processing.
   - For `)`: Pop the operator and the sub-expressions, evaluate them, and push the result back onto the stack.

3. **Evaluate sub-expressions**: Based on the operator (`&`, `|`, or `!`), combine the sub-expressions and evaluate them:
   - **&**: All sub-expressions must be `true`.
   - **|**: At least one sub-expressions must be `true`.
   - **!**: The single sub-expression must be negated.

4. **Return the final result**: The final result is the evaluated value after processing the entire string.

# Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where *n* is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once, and evaluations happen in constant time for each sub-expression.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(n)*** due to the use of the stack to store sub-expressions and operators.

# Code:

```typescript
function parseBoolExpr(expression: string): boolean {
    const stack: any[] = [];
    
    for (let char of expression) {
        if (char === 't' || char === 'f') {
            stack.push(char === 't');
        } else if (char === '!' || char === '&' || char === '|') {
            stack.push(char);
        } else if (char === '(') {
            stack.push('(');
        } else if (char === ')') {
            let operands: boolean[] = [];
            
            while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] !== '(') {
                operands.push(stack.pop());
            }
            
            stack.pop();
            const operator = stack.pop();

            let result: boolean;
            if (operator === '!') {
                result = !operands[0];
            } else if (operator === '&') {
                result = operands.every(Boolean);
            } else if (operator === '|') {
                result = operands.some(Boolean);
            }
            
            stack.push(result);
        }
    }
    
    return stack.pop();
};

```

### Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `expression = "&(|(f))"`

- The stack starts empty.
- We encounter `&`, push it to the stack: `['&']`.
- We encounter `|`, push it to the stack: `['&', '|']`.
- We encounter `f`, push it to the stack as `false`: `['&', '|', false]`.
- We hit the closing `)`, evaluate the OR sub-expression: result = `false`.
  - Stack now: `['&', false]`.
- We hit the next closing `)`, evaluate the AND sub-expression: result = `false`.
  - Stack now: `[false]`.
- Return `false`.

**Output**: `false`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `expression = "|(f,f,f,t)"`

- The stack starts empty.
- We encounter `|`, push it to the stack: `['|']`.
- We encounter `f`, push it as `false`, repeat for each `f`: `['|', false, false, false]`.
- We encounter `t`, push it as `true`: `['|', false, false, false, true]`.
- We hit the closing `)`, evaluate the OR sub-expression: result = `true`.
  - Stack now: `[true]`.
- Return `true`.

**Output**: `true`

#### Example 3:
**Input**: `expression = "!(&(f,t))"`

- The stack starts empty.
- We encounter `!`, push it to the stack: `['!']`.
- We encounter `&`, push it to the stack: `['!', '&']`.
- We encounter `f`, push it as `false`, `t` as `true`: `['!', '&', false, true]`.
- We hit the closing `)`, evaluate the AND sub-expression: result = `false`.
  - Stack now: `['!', false]`.
- We hit the closing `)`, evaluate the NOT sub-expression: result = `true`.
  - Stack now: `[true]`.
- Return `true`.

**Output**: `true`

### Conclusion:

This stack-based approach efficiently evaluates nested Boolean expressions by pushing operators and sub-expressions onto the stack and evaluating them as soon as a closing parenthesis is encountered. The result is computed step by step by processing the string exactly once.
