[1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/)

# Intuition

We need to repeatedly remove occurrences of `part` from `s` until it no longer appears in `s`. Since `part` is always contiguous, a simple **string search and replace** operation can be performed iteratively.

Given that:
- `s.length ≤ 1000`
- `part.length ≤ 1000` A **string-based approach** will be efficient.

# Approach

1. **Iterative Removal**:
    - Use `s.indexOf(part)` to find the leftmost occurrence of `part`.
    - Remove the substring by slicing `s` and reconstructing it without `part`.
    - Repeat until `part` is no longer found in `s`.
	
2. **String Manipulation**:
    - We continuously modify `s` by removing `part`.
    - The process stops when no occurrence of `part` remains.
	
3. **Efficiency Consideration**:
    - The worst case occurs when we remove one `part` at a time, requiring `O(n)` iterations.
    - Each removal operation takes `O(n)`, leading to an overall complexity of **O(n²)** in the worst case.

# Complexity Analysis

- **Finding `part` in `s`** takes **O(n)** in the worst case.
- **Removing `part` and reconstructing `s`** also takes **O(n)**.
- **Loop runs at most `O(n)` times**, leading to an overall **O(n²) complexity**.

However, given `n ≤ 1000`, this approach remains feasible.

# Code

```typescript
function removeOccurrences(s: string, part: string): string {
    while (s.includes(part)) {
        s = s.replace(part, ""); // Remove the first occurrence of 'part'
    }
    return s;
};

```

## **Example Walkthrough**

### **Example 1**

#### **Input:**

```typescript
s = "daabcbaabcbc", part = "abc"
```

#### **Processing:**

4. `"daabcbaabcbc"` → Remove `"abc"` at index 2 → `"dabaabcbc"`
5. `"dabaabcbc"` → Remove `"abc"` at index 4 → `"dababc"`
6. `"dababc"` → Remove `"abc"` at index 3 → `"dab"`

#### **Output:** `"dab"`

### **Example 2**

#### **Input:**

```typescript
s = "axxxxyyyyb", part = "xy"
```

#### **Processing:**

7. `"axxxxyyyyb"` → Remove `"xy"` at index 4 → `"axxxyyyb"`
8. `"axxxyyyb"` → Remove `"xy"` at index 3 → `"axxyyb"`
9. `"axxyyb"` → Remove `"xy"` at index 2 → `"axyb"`
10. `"axyb"` → Remove `"xy"` at index 1 → `"ab"`

#### **Output:** `"ab"`

## **Edge Cases Considered**

11. **No Occurrences of `part`**
    
    - Example: `s = "abcdef", part = "xyz"`
    - Output: `"abcdef"` (unchanged)
12. **Entire String is `part`**
    
    - Example: `s = "aaa", part = "aaa"`
    - Output: `""` (empty string)
13. **Overlapping Substrings**
    
    - Example: `s = "aaaaa", part = "aa"`
    - Process:
        - `"aaaaa"` → `"aaa"` → `"a"`
    - Output: `"a"`
14. **Removing `part` Results in New Occurrences**
    
    - Example: `s = "abcabcabc", part = "abc"`
    - Output: `""` (completely removed)

## **Key Takeaways**

- Uses **simple string manipulation** for ease of implementation.  
- **O(n²) complexity is manageable** for `n ≤ 1000`.  
- **Edge cases handled effectively**, including overlapping and complete removals.  
- **Efficient for small string constraints** in competitive programming!
