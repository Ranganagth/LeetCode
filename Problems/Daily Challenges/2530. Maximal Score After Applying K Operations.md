[2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-score-after-applying-k-operations/)

# Intuition:

The goal is to maximize the score after applying exactly `k` operations on the array `nums`. In each operation, you:
1. Pick an element from the array.
2. Add its value to your score.
3. Replace the element with its ceiling value after dividing it by 3 (`ceil(nums[i] / 3)`).

### Key Observations:
- Since the score is increased by the value of the chosen element, we want to prioritize selecting larger values from the array to maximize the score.
- After each selection, the element's value is reduced by being divided by 3, so it may not be as useful for future selections.
- This suggests that we should always pick the current maximum value from the array and then replace it with its ceiling after division.

# Approach:

This problem can be efficiently solved using a **max-heap** (or priority queue). The max-heap allows us to quickly get the maximum element in the array, which is crucial for maximizing the score in each operation.

**Steps**:
1. **Max-Heap**: Initialize a max-heap with all the elements from `nums`. In each iteration, extract the maximum element, add it to the score, and then push the updated element (after applying the ceiling function) back into the heap.
   
2. **Ceiling Calculation**: For each element, the next value after selection will be `ceil(current_element / 3)`. For example:
   - If the current element is `10`, the next value is `ceil(10 / 3) = 4`.
   - If the current element is `4`, the next value is `ceil(4 / 3) = 2`.

3. **Repeat**: Repeat the process for exactly `k` operations to get the maximum score.

# Complexity:
### Time Complexity:
- **Heap Construction**: Building the max-heap takes *O(n)*, where *n* is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Operations**: For each of the `k` operations, we extract the maximum element (which takes **O(log n)** and insert the new value (also ***O(log n)***.
- The overall time complexity is ***O(n + k log n)***, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is ***O(n)*** due to the storage of the heap.

# Code:

```typescript
function maxScoreAfterKOperations(nums: number[], k: number): number {
    const maxHeap = new MaxPriorityQueue({ priority: (val: number) => val });

    for (let num of nums) {
        maxHeap.enqueue(num);
    }

    let score = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        const largest = maxHeap.dequeue().element;

        score += largest;

        const nextValue = Math.ceil(largest / 3);

        maxHeap.enqueue(nextValue);
    }

    return score;
};

```

### Explanation and Example Walkthrough:

#### Example 1:
**Input**: `nums = [10,10,10,10,10]`, `k = 5`

- **Heap Initialization**: Initially, the heap contains all the elements `[10, 10, 10, 10, 10]`.
- **Operations**:
  - Operation 1: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `10`. Replace `10` with `4` (since `ceil(10/3) = 4`).
  - Operation 2: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `20`. Replace `10` with `4`.
  - Operation 3: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `30`. Replace `10` with `4`.
  - Operation 4: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `40`. Replace `10` with `4`.
  - Operation 5: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `50`. Replace `10` with `4`.
  
**Output**: `50`

#### Example 2:
**Input**: `nums = [1,10,3,3,3]`, `k = 3`

- **Heap Initialization**: The heap starts with `[10, 3, 3, 3, 1]`.
- **Operations**:
  - Operation 1: Extract `10`, add to score -> score = `10`. Replace `10` with `4` (since `ceil(10/3) = 4`).
  - Operation 2: Extract `4`, add to score -> score = `14`. Replace `4` with `2` (since `ceil(4/3) = 2`).
  - Operation 3: Extract `3`, add to score -> score = `17`. Replace `3` with `1` (since `ceil(3/3) = 1`).
  
**Output**: `17`

### Explanation:
- The priority queue ensures that we always pick the largest element from `nums`, and after extracting it, we compute the next value by dividing by 3 and applying the ceiling function. This continues for `k` iterations to maximize the score.
