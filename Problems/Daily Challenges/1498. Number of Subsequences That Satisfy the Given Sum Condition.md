[1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-subsequences-that-satisfy-the-given-sum-condition/)

### Problem Summary

You are asked to find how many **non-empty subsequences** in an array `nums` have a **sum of the minimum and maximum element** in that subsequence **less than or equal to a target**. Since the total number can be very large, return the answer modulo $10^9 + 7$.

---

# Intuition

If we sort the array, then:
* For each index `i` (which we treat as the **minimum element** of a subsequence), we can find the **farthest index `j`** such that `nums[i] + nums[j] <= target`.
* Every element between `i` and `j` can be **included or excluded**, leading to $2^{j - i}$ subsequences.

This gives a sliding window with two pointers.

---

# Approach

1. **Sort `nums`**.
2. **Precompute powers of 2 modulo $10^9 + 7$** up to `nums.length`.
3. **Use two pointers**:

   * Fix `i` as the minimum element,
   * Find the maximum index `j` where `nums[i] + nums[j] <= target`,
   * Count subsequences between `i` and `j` using $2^{j - i}$.
4. Sum them up.

---

# Complexity Analysis

* Time: `O(n log n)` due to sorting, and `O(n)` for the two-pointer traversal.
* Space: `O(n)` for the powers array.

# Code

```ts
function numSubseq(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = nums.length;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD
    const pow2: number[] = Array(n).fill(1);
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        pow2[i] = (pow2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
    }

    let left = 0;
    let right = n - 1;
    let result = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        if (nums[left] + nums[right] <= target) {
            result = (result + pow2[right - left]) % MOD;
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

```

### **Example Walkthrough**

**Input**: `nums = [3,5,6,7]`, `target = 9`

Sorted: `[3,5,6,7]`

* i = 0, j = 2 → (3 + 6 <= 9) → valid → 2^(2-0) = 4
* i = 1, j = 1 → (5 + 5 > 9) → skip
* i = 2, j = 1 → loop ends

**Output**: `4`

---

### **Summary**

This solution optimally handles the constraint (`nums.length ≤ 10^5`) by:
* Using sorting to fix min and max efficiently,
* Using power precomputation to avoid recalculations,
* Using two-pointer window to count valid ranges.

This is a classic example of combining **greedy** and **preprocessing** for efficient subsequence counting.
