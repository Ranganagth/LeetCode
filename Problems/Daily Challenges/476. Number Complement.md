[476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

# Intuition:
- The binary complement of a number can be obtained by XORing the number with a mask that has all bits set to `1` for the length of the binary representation of the number.
- For example, for `num = 5` (which is `101` in binary), the mask would be `111`, and the XOR of `101` and `111` gives `010`, which is the complement.

# Approach:
1. **Calculate the Mask**:
   - The mask should have the same length as the binary representation of the input number and consist only of `1`s.
   - To create such a mask, start with `1` (which in binary is `1`) and shift it left until its length exceeds the length of the binary representation of the number. Subtract `1` to make all bits `1`.
   
2. **Apply XOR**:
   - XOR the original number with the mask to flip the bits.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since the operations involved (like finding the binary length, creating a mask, and XORing) are constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)*** as we use only a few variables.

# Code:
```typescript
function findComplement(num: number): number {
    if (num === 1) return 0;
    
    const bitLength = num.toString(2).length;
    const mask = (1 << bitLength) - 1;
    
    return num ^ mask;
};

```

## Example usage:

```typescript
console.log(findComplement(5));  // Output: 2
console.log(findComplement(1));  // Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
- **Edge Case Handling**: If `num` is `1`, the expected output is `0` because flipping the only bit `1` results in `0`.
- **Bit Length Calculation**: `num.toString(2).length` gives the number of bits in the binary representation of `num`.
- **Mask Creation**: `(1 << bitLength) - 1` generates a binary number with all `1`s corresponding to the length of `num`.
- **Complement Calculation**: XOR the `num` with the mask to flip the bits.
