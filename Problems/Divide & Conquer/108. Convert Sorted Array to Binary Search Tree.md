[108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)

# Intuition
To convert a sorted array into a height-balanced binary search tree (BST), we should utilize the middle element of the array as the root to ensure the tree remains balanced. The left half of the array will form the left subtree, and the right half will form the right subtree. This approach ensures that the depths of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one, thus maintaining the height-balance property.

# Approach
1. **Recursive Approach**: 
   - Find the middle element of the current subarray and make it the root of the current subtree.
   - Recursively apply the same approach to the left half of the subarray to construct the left subtree.
   - Recursively apply the same approach to the right half of the subarray to construct the right subtree.
2. **Base Case**: When the subarray is empty, return `null` indicating that there are no more nodes to add.

# Explanation
1. **Find Middle Element**: Calculate the middle index of the array/subarray to ensure the BST is balanced.
2. **Create Root Node**: Create a tree node with the middle element.
3. **Recursive Calls**: Recursively create left and right subtrees using the left and right halves of the array/subarray.
4. **Combine**: Attach the left and right subtrees to the root node, ensuring the overall tree structure is maintained.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity:**
  - Each element of the array is visited exactly once, leading to a time complexity of ***O(n)***, where n is the number of elements in the array.

- **Space complexity:**
  - The space complexity is ***O(log n)*** for the recursion stack, since the depth of the recursion tree is log(n) for a balanced BST.

# Code
```TypeScript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function sortedArrayToBST(nums: number[]): TreeNode | null {
    const buildBST = (left: number, right: number): TreeNode | null => {
        if (left > right) {
            return null;
        }
        
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        
        node.left = buildBST(left, mid - 1);
        node.right = buildBST(mid + 1, right);
        
        return node;
    };
    
    return buildBST(0, nums.length - 1);
};
