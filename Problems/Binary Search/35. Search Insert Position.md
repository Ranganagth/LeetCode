[35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)

# Intuition
To find the index of the target value in a sorted array of distinct integers or determine where it would be inserted, we can utilize binary search. This approach ensures an O(log n) runtime complexity, which is efficient for the problem's constraints.

# Approach
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Use binary search to locate the target or determine the position where it should be inserted.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array respectively.
   - While `left` is less than or equal to `right`, calculate the middle index `mid`.
   - If the target is found at `mid`, return `mid`.
   - If the target is less than the value at `mid`, adjust the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
   - If the target is greater than the value at `mid`, adjust the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If the target is not found, the `left` pointer will indicate the index where the target should be inserted.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(log n)***, where **n** is the length of the array. This is because binary search is used.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```typescript
function searchInsert(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
};
