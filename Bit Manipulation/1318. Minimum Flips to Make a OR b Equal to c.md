[1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/)

# Approach:

1. **Understanding the Bitwise OR Operation**:
   - The `|` (bitwise OR) operation between two bits results in `1` if at least one of the bits is `1`.
   - To achieve `(a | b) == c`, every bit in `c` must be either `0` or `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits in `a` or `b` is `1`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To ensure that `(a | b) == c`, each bit position where `c` has `0` must have `0` in both `a` and `b`.
   - Each bit position where `c` has `1` can have either `1` in `a`, `b`, or both.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Flips**:
   - Iterate through each bit position of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Count the number of positions where both `a` and `b` have `1` and `c` has `0`. This is because we need to flip both `1`s in `a` and `b` to `0` to make `(a | b) == c`.
   - Count the number of positions where both `a` and `b` have `0` and `c` has `1`. This is because we need to flip at least one of `a` or `b` to `1` to make `(a | b) == c`.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use bit manipulation to iterate through each bit position.
   - Count the necessary flips based on the above observations.
# Explanation:
- We use a loop to iterate over each bit position from 0 to 31 (since numbers are constrained to be less than \(10^9\), which fits within 32 bits).
- For each bit position, extract the corresponding bit from `a`, `b`, and `c` using bit shifting and masking.
- Check if the current bit in `(a | b)` matches the corresponding bit in `c`.
- If not, increment the `flips` counter based on the conditions derived above.
- Finally, return the total number of flips required.

# Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: ***O(1)*** since the maximum number of iterations is 32, regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(1)***, as we use only a constant amount of extra space.
# Code:
```typescript
function minFlips(a: number, b: number, c: number): number {
    let flips = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        const bitA = (a >> i) & 1;
        const bitB = (b >> i) & 1;
        const bitC = (c >> i) & 1;
        
        if ((bitA | bitB) !== bitC) {
            if (bitC === 1) {
                flips++;
            } else {
                if (bitA === 1) flips++;
                if (bitB === 1) flips++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return flips;
};
```
