[901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)

# Approach:

1. **Monotonic Stack**:
   - We'll use a stack to keep track of indices of prices in such a way that the prices represented by these indices are in a decreasing order.
   - The stack will help us quickly calculate the span for each day.

2. **Data Structure**:
   - Use two arrays:
     - `prices`: To store the daily prices.
     - `span`: To store the span of the stock's price for each day.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each price received in `next(price)`:
     - Initialize the span of the current day to 1.
     - While the stack is not empty and the price at the index represented by the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current price:
       - Pop elements from the stack and add their spans to the current day's span.
     - Push the index of the current price onto the stack.
     - Store the current day's span in the `span` array.
     - Return the current day's span.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no previous days or if the previous days have higher prices, the span will be 1.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Each price is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, leading to a total time complexity of ***O(n)***, where n is the number of calls to `next`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - ***O(n)***, where n is the number of calls to `next`, due to the space used by the `prices`, `span`, and `stack` arrays.

# Code:
```typescript
class StockSpanner {
    prices: number[];
    span: number[];
    stack: number[];
    
    constructor() {
        this.prices = [];
        this.span = [];
        this.stack = [];
    }

    next(price: number): number {
        this.prices.push(price);
        let index = this.prices.length - 1;
        let count = 1;

        while (this.stack.length > 0 && this.prices[this.stack[this.stack.length - 1]] <= price) {
            let top = this.stack.pop()!;
            count += this.span[top];
        }

        this.span[index] = count;
        this.stack.push(index);
        return count;
    }
};

```
