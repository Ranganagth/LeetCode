[739. Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

# Intuition:

To solve the problem efficiently, we use a monotonic stack-based approach. The idea is to traverse the array of temperatures and keep a stack of indices of the temperatures. We push temperatures onto the stack and maintain the stack in such a way that temperatures are in decreasing order. This allows us to efficiently find the next warmer temperature for each day.

# Approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an array `result` of the same length as `temperatures` to store the number of days to wait.
   - Initialize an empty stack to keep track of indices of the temperatures.

2. **Processing Each Temperature**:
   - Traverse the `temperatures` array from left to right.
   - For each temperature:
     - While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
       - Pop the index from the stack.
       - Calculate the number of days to wait as the difference between the current index and the index popped from the stack.
       - Store this number in the `result` array at the popped index.
     - Push the current index onto the stack.

3. **Result**:
   - After processing all temperatures, any indices remaining in the stack mean that no warmer temperature was found for those days. Hence, their entries in the `result` array remain 0.

4. **Return**:
   - Return the `result` array which contains the number of days to wait after each day to get a warmer temperature.

# Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: ***O(n)***, where n is the number of temperatures. Each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: ***O(n)***, for the stack and the result array.

# Code:
```typescript
function dailyTemperatures(temperatures: number[]): number[] {
    const n = temperatures.length;
    const stack: number[] = [];
    const result: number[] = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (stack.length && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            const index = stack.pop()!;
            result[index] = i - index;
        }
        stack.push(i);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - `stack`: Used to store indices of temperatures.
  - `result`: Initialized with zeros and will store the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.

- **Main Loop**:
  - Iterate through each temperature in the `temperatures` array.
  - While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack:
    - Pop the index from the stack.
    - Calculate the number of days to wait and store it in the `result` array.
  - Push the current index onto the stack.

- **Return**:
  - Return the `result` array which contains the number of days to wait after each day to get a warmer temperature.
