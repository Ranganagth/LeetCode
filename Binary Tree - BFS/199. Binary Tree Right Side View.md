[199. Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)

# Intuition
When performing a BFS traversal (level order traversal), we can ensure that we visit all nodes level by level. By capturing the last node encountered at each level, we can obtain the right view of the tree.

# Approach
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a queue to traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Track Last Node at Each Level**: For each level, keep track of the last node encountered and add its value to the result list.
3. **Iterate Through Levels**: Continue this process until all levels are traversed.
4. **Edge Case**: Handle the case where the tree is empty by returning an empty list.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: ***O(n)***, where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the tree. In the worst case, the queue might store all nodes at the last level.

# Code
```typescript
class TreeNode {
    val: number;
    left: TreeNode | null;
    right: TreeNode | null;
    constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.left = (left === undefined ? null : left);
        this.right = (right === undefined ? null : right);
    }
}

function rightSideView(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    if (!root) {
        return [];
    }

    const result: number[] = [];
    const queue: TreeNode[] = [root];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let rightMostValue: number = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            const node = queue.shift()!;
            rightMostValue = node.val;

            if (node.left) {
                queue.push(node.left);
            }
            if (node.right) {
                queue.push(node.right);
            }
        }

        result.push(rightMostValue);
    }

    return result;
};

```

In this code:
1. **TreeNode**: Class defines the structure of a binary tree node.
2. **rightSideView**: Function that performs a BFS traversal of the tree to capture the right view.
3. **Queue**: Used to facilitate the level order traversal.
4. **Rightmost Node Capture**: For each level, we capture the last node's value and add it to the result list.

> This approach ensures that we efficiently capture the right view of the binary tree, traversing each node only once and using a queue to manage the traversal order.
